        "Content": "The Chairman: Head S, Ministry of Manpower, Mr Patrick Tay.Fairness–Work, Workers and WorkplacesMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast): Sir, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head S of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".I wish to dedicate my cut to highlighting three important manpower issues in Singapore to enhance fairness and opportunity – for all workers, regardless of the work that they do and their workplaces. First, Singaporean Core; second, mature and mid-career workers and Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs); third, freelance and self-employed.On strengthening the Singaporean Core, I applaud the recent move by the MOM to further augment and strengthen the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) and the naming of recalcitrant companies and employers. I congratulate the good work done by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP).I wish to ask MOM to provide an update on how effective the FCF has been to level the playing field for Singaporean PMEs and remove nationality discrimination in hiring practices. Since 1 August 2014, how many complaints have been received and how many companies have MOM called up for additional scrutiny and what has been the success rate in convincing and ensuring that companies discontinue their poor hiring practices.Many PMEs I have met have shared that they are not unhappy with foreign PMEs who bring in huge businesses and investments in Singapore and have unique international competencies. Instead, they are unhappy with foreign PMEs doing jobs which Singaporeans can undertake and do. At the same time, we want to see further efforts to encourage capability transfer, so that we can develop a Singaporean Core across all levels of hierarchy, from rank and file to top management.In this area of strengthening the Singaporean Core, I have four suggestions. First, with the rise of S Pass numbers, can MOM explore extending the FCF to S Pass holders as well. Second, whether MOM can review the salary ceiling for Employment Pass applicants to level the playing field for our Singaporean PMEs. This is also in consideration of the rise in median and entry salaries of our local PMEs. Third, to review and better scrutinise the FCF exemption on intra-company transfers. Fourth, whether MOM can push ahead in creating more flexible work-from-home opportunities for Singaporeans.The question to ask is, are there tasks or jobs that can be arranged to be performed by Singaporeans who require very flexible work arrangements, for example stay-at-home dads or mums, care-givers for parents, those with family members who are ill and so on. I find this important, particularly with an ageing populace. This can also be a source of employment for those who are not able to fit into the current model of flexible employment, where work can still be delivered for less time-critical tasks.On mid-career and mature PMEs, I highlighted during the Budget Debate on the exacting challenges faced by mid-career and mature workers especially PMEs in the area of finding work and staying employable. I wish to ask MOM for an update including the take-up figures, retrenchment and data on the various schemes under the Adapt and Grow since it was first launched. In particular, I wish to ask first on the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) – further sub-divided into PCP for new entrants as well as those pre-emptive in-employment PCPs. I also wish to ask how MOM intends to make the PCP an attractive option for PMEs and better manage the dropout rate of PCP candidates.Second, the Career Support Programme (CSP) was rolled out on 1 October 2015 to encourage employers to hire mature PMEs for jobs paying $4000 and above, by providing salary support. I wish to ask how CSP has made mid-career PMEs more employed and employable. In particular, are there avenues to further enhance and expand the CSP scheme so as to help more mid-career PMEs land themselves in suitable quality jobs.Third, the Jobs Bank, now known as the My Careers Future portal. How successful has the portal been to connect mid-career PMEs to jobs and minimise situations whereby there is jobs and skills mismatch? I also wish to ask if further enhancements can be made so the portal can also leverage on big data to better enhance job matching.By the same token, anecdotally, I still hear complaints of ageism in the hiring of workers in various workplaces. Though not rampant, this is and will be a growing challenge as we face the imminent challenges of an ageing workforce, an increasingly mature and older workforce, and as we raise the retirement and re-employment ages.Job redesign and augmented technology and intelligence are imperatives but will not be the dynamic panacea. I cannot emphasise the need for us to change mindsets and attitudes towards this segment of workers. Besides the tripartite partners, our people and society as a whole must embrace the changing fabric of the Singaporean workforce so that we can overcome unfortunate stereotyping and mental models.On freelancers and self-employed, this group of workers are one big group affected by the current COVID-19 situation. To mitigate the effects brought about by the outbreak and better support freelancers and self-employed persons during this lull period, I reiterate the call I made during the Budget debate to extend the absentee payroll – which is traditionally used to fund employers – to this group of workers. This is so that they can also have the opportunity to go for skills upgrading and training, while receiving a training allowance. NTUC stands ready to partner the Government to administer the Surrogate Employer Programme, so that we can better encourage our freelancers and self-employed persons to come forward for training. Sir, in Mandarin.2.00 pm(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]How to ensure that all workers including white-collar, blue-collar and freelancers are treated fairly has always been an area of concern of NTUC. In this regard, I have three suggestions.Firstly, MOM recently reviewed its Fair Consideration Framework to act as a deterrent for employers who discriminate against Singaporeans. This is indeed very encouraging. At the same time, we must continue to strengthen our Singaporean core, for example, by tightening the eligibility criteria for S Pass and EP holders, or even by providing more opportunities for Singaporeans to adopt flexi-work arrangements.Meanwhile, we want to better assist Singaporeans between 40 to 60 years old to find good jobs and to stay relevant. Can we consider enhancing the various government schemes, such as the Professional Conversion Programme, Career Support Programme or even the Jobs Bank, in order to help more Singaporeans secure better jobs and to enjoy better career advancement? As the workforce ages, I encourage everyone to change their mindsets and attitudes towards middle-aged and senior workers.Thirdly, the COVID-19 outbreak has greatly impacted a lot of freelancers and self-employed workers. Our priority is to help this group of workers and other neglected workers during this period and allow them to receive wage supplements during leave of absence. NTUC stands ready to partner the Government to administer the Surrogate Employer Programme so that we can better encourage our freelancers to come forward for training and upskilling.Question proposed.Support for Mid-career WorkersMs Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast): Mr Chairman, the support for Singaporean workers aged 40 to 60 years in this year's Budget is a welcome move. With technological advances and digital disruptions, businesses need talent as they transform. Mid-career workers are concerned as the nature of work and jobs are changing and they worry that there may not be enough or suitable jobs. Paradoxically, we see a situation where companies are seeking skilled talent and are facing a talent crunch. Mid-career workers who are displaced are finding it harder to find suitable employment.As we focus on supporting mid-career workers on re-skilling for new roles to meet changing business requirements, I want to stress that we should also build upon the experience, expertise and knowledge of mid-career workers, especially PMEs.While digital skills and technology are increasingly required to get work done, technologies, for example, artificial intelligence and data analytics, do not exist in a vacuum. In fact, if we examine the roles that are in demand, while many of the roles require the ability to handle technology, they are at the same time more complex and multi-disciplinary, requiring business acumen and a wide set of skills from different fields, for example, design, marketing, sales and customer services, and even operational know-how. These are quality roles and not low-level entry jobs.While mid-career PMEs will need to learn new skills, especially digital skills, they have the experience, expertise and knowledge. And organisations should and must tap on this valuable talent base. While younger talent may be equipped with new skills, be agile in learning, they will need time to acquire multi-disciplinary skills and expertise that mid-career workers have built up over their careers. In coping with today's complex and fast-changing market, businesses will need both young and mid-career workers to transform and will benefit from having a diverse talent pool, creating a work environment that effectively engages a diverse workforce of both young and mid-career workers, and this will be a competitive advantage for businesses.For companies to up-skill their own mid-career employees or to hire mid-career employees effectively, they need to also understand the existing skills that their mid-career employees have and also what their business requires. This will enable better alignment of employment development for the new jobs. I hope that the various skills programmes will take this into account and provide the job pathways and relevancy of the existing and new skills required to help mid-career workers.Mid-career TransitionsMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied): Chairman, mid-career transitions may be one of the most daunting experiences for workers. I will touch on the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) and career transition schemes.First, the FCF. Four years ago, my colleague, Member of Parliament Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap, highlighted that the original FCF needed enforcement measures. Anecdotally, some mid-career transitioners have experienced being called up for third or fourth interviews with employers, but sensing from the body language of interviewers that everyone was \"going through the motions\" to tick boxes before applying for work passes to hire foreigners. I believe that the Minister is well aware of some employers who treat the FCF as, to quote her, \"a paper exercise\".The announcement in January that MOM is enhancing the FCF is welcome. In particular, I note that MOM has started to charge employers in court under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act for making false declarations that they had considered local applicants fairly before trying to apply for a foreigner.However, it seems that in recent years, most of the discrimination cases came to the Ministry's attention through whistle-blowing. Is the Ministry going to step up proactive detection of its own?My second point relates to career transition programmes. Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) and Career Support Programmes (CSPs) are key planks of the Government's Adapt and Grow initiative to help mid-career transitions. In his Budget round-up speech last week, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat assessed that the results were encouraging. He highlighted that career coaches worked with about 27,000 jobseekers every year and in 2018, managed to place about 70% into new jobs within six months.However, I have encountered some in the balance 30%, who expressed difficulties in finding work through the schemes despite their best efforts. To what extent is success hampered by capacity issues, that is, insufficient job openings, or is matching of jobs to applicants the bigger issue?Mr Chairman: Mr Douglas Foo, both your cuts, please.Worker Re-skillingMr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, as Trade Associations and Chambers like the Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) continue to work with enterprises to re-skill and train employees, the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit scheme is a welcome announcement. However, a common feedback from employees is that they are hesitant to go for training because when they return to the office, they have to deal with accumulated backlog. In a 2019 survey by Linkedin, 57% of Singaporean employees said the most significant challenge to re-skilling was the lack of time.Yet, it is pertinent that organisations need to take a long-term view and to look into re-skilling their employees. The burden is largely on employers right now to juggle the limited resources, uncertain demand, maintaining the payroll and continue with training efforts.Therefore, does the Ministry have in place plans to encourage and educate employers to put in place more facilitative work arrangements to allow for staff to go for training without worrying that they have a large workload to return to? In the same vein, are there plans to alleviate employer difficulties that arise from employees going for re-skilling? How can Trade Associations and Chambers play a role in this journey?Fair and Progressive EmploymentSecond cut. Chairman, the Government has introduced many tripartite committees and initiatives such as the Singapore Tripartism Forum (STF), National Wages Council (NWC), Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) and Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers.Such tripartisan initiatives promote greater awareness for fair and progressive employment practices to employers. The good work from their efforts are often brought up during our engagement with members from the business communities.However, there will always be some errant employers out there who go against the principles of fair and progressive employment. We must be careful that in formulating policies, we do not inevitably place bigger burdens on the majority of employers by putting in place measures aimed at preventing the behaviour of the errant minority. In turn, employers should support the targeted moves the Government makes to go after bad behaviour.In Budget 2020, Deputy Prime Minister Heng has introduced many measures under the third thrust of the Transformation and Growth strategy to develop the capabilities of our workers. The Singapore Manufacturing Federation is a firm supporter of lifelong learning for workers to be ready for new challenges and opportunities to progress and grow with enterprises.One profession I would like to highlight would be the training and development of Human Resources (HR) professionals. With the advent of new technologies and the skill sets required emerging in the workforce, our HR professionals would also need to learn new skills and strategies to nurture and manage this new workforce of the future.In this regard, what is the Ministry's plans to nurture a pool of human capital talents that would assist enterprises in strategic forward planning for sustainable development for both people and enterprises?Fair Consideration Framework (FCF)Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten): Sir, earlier this year, Minister Josephine Teo shared on her Facebook that MOM is \"rededicating\" itself to strengthening fairness at the workplace as a value and a virtue. She also warned that there would be \"stronger deterrence for discrimination against Singaporeans when hiring, but also stronger support for employers who are committed to giving our people a fair chance.\"I support this approach by MOM. For some years, Singaporeans have complained about companies where most of their colleagues are foreigners and Singaporean employees are in the minority.That kind of practice cannot be a right practice. Businesses operating in Singapore must help create more employment opportunities for Singaporeans. The Government must send a strong signal to companies which discriminate against Singaporeans and favour foreigners that their employment process is wrong. Singaporeans must be given fair consideration if they meet the right criteria. Unfair and discriminatory employment practices affect the harmony among Singaporean residents and cause unfair resentment against foreigners who may be genuinely needed in Singapore, due to their specific skills and expertise.In February, I filed a Parliamentary Question about complaints received regarding excessive foreigners in financial institutions. I was glad to read MOM's reply that they will not tolerate any form of workplace discrimination and has also recently raised penalties. Thus, whether the businesses are banks, financial institutions or large multinational corporations (MNCs), I urge MOM to constantly check their employment practices and their Singaporean employee statistics. I also urge MOM to consider taking action not just against recalcitrant businesses but also against the HR or senior management responsible for such practices. MOM should not hesitate to name companies found to have discriminatory employment practices so that Singaporeans know who they are.Revisiting the $15,000 Cap under FCFMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok): Sir, the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF), implemented in 2014 and last updated in 2018, does not require a prospective employer intending to apply for an Employment Pass for a post that pays salary above the specified limit to advertise to Singaporeans beforehand in the National Jobs Bank. The specified limit was originally a salary of $12,000 per month. This was increased in 2018 to $15,000 per month.Notwithstanding the exemption, the Ministry of Manpower still requires all employers to consider Singaporeans fairly.Sir, in your capacity as acting Minister for Manpower, you explained the rationale to this House in 2013. You said, \"This is because open advertising for jobs such as these is usually done in a different manner. Furthermore, such jobs only cover 5% of the local workforce, meaning that the vast majority of jobs would be covered by advertising requirements.\"I believe the FCF has served us well in ensuring that there is a strong Singaporean PME core in the industries. With the experience gained over almost six years, I wonder whether this is an opportune time to review the FCF to ensure that a proper balance continues to be struck between giving Singaporeans a fair opportunity to access high quality jobs and ensuring that Singapore is an attractive place to do business.I would like to suggest that we do away with the salary ceiling altogether for the following three reasons.First, in the current economic landscape, it should not matter that jobs above the salary peg only covers 5% of the local workforce. What is key is whether Singaporeans are fairly considered for the post in question before a foreigner is considered. Also, the jobs above the current salary ceiling usually involve senior positions such as C-suite officers in multinational corporations (MNCs) or banks. These are high quality jobs which suitably qualified Singaporeans would be aspiring for.Second, without advertising, it will never be clear whether qualified Singaporeans are made aware of such job openings.Lastly, the quantum of the salary ceiling, which is applicable throughout the workforce, is not representative of the average salaries for senior jobs in certain industries such as finance and technology.Unfair Hiring PracticesMr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Chairman, I was heartened to learn about stronger measures rolled out by the Ministry in January this year against companies that discriminate against Singaporeans during the hiring process. Offending employers will be barred from applying for new work passes for between 12 and 24 months, up from the minimum period of six months before. Furthermore, they will no longer be allowed to renew their existing work passes.Would the Ministry provide an update on the results of enforcement measures against errant companies in the last 12 months? What additional measures has the Ministry implemented in the last year to ensure fair hiring practices and a level playing field for Singaporeans? Will the Minister share an update on its review of the foreign worker hiring policies and the progress on efforts against other forms of workplace discrimination?Tightening S Pass Sub-Dependency Ratio CeilingMiss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines): Sir, I declare my interest that my father owns a business in the process industry, although I have not been involved in the business for over two years.In 2016, I filed an MOM cut on local talents. I said then that one of the challenges faced by SMEs is finding local talent. It is common knowledge that companies need high quality staff for expansion and survival of business. Many SMEs want to employ local talent but some locals might find that it is more glamorous to work for MNCs.2.15 pmThen, I had proposed for our trade associations to work closely with IHLs to close the gaps in employment. We should also build up the image of mastery of skills and trade.Budget 2020 announces reduction of the S Pass sub-DRCs of the construction, marine and process sectors from 20% to 18% 2021 and 15% 2023.However, many companies, especially smaller scale ones, find it challenging to hire local talents. Some of the jobs in those three sectors are simply not attractive to locals. Long project working hours, sector specific hazards and remote workplace, such as Tuas and Jurong Island, are not helping.I am concerned that the challenging terrain faced by these companies would become even more challenging come 2021 and 2023. How can we help these companies to smoothen the transition to lesser S Passes and more locals in the future? How are our IHLs training locals to fill those roles?Support for Senior WorkersMr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon): Sir, prior to this Budget, to help our senior workers age with purpose and dignity, Singapore already has a set of pro-senior worker policies. And this year, I am heartened to see that we have continued building on this very strong foundation. In fact, our goal to say that this is a very exciting year for our senior workers.There are at least five key new policies and refinements that benefit our senior workers this year. These include the Enhanced Second Employment Credit, the CPF Transition Offsets, Senior Worker Early Adopter Grant and the Part-Time Re-employment Grant as well as the Matched Retirement Saving Schemes. And these are on top of the improvements of the Silver Support Scheme that improves on social assistance for our seniors and HDB's Lease Buy-back that strengthens the retirement adequacy of our seniors.This is surely the result of MOM's Working Group for Senior Workers, and MOM's willingness to engage many groups of stakeholders, including the PAP.SG through two Private Members' Motion on seniors over the past two years.As such, can MOM provide the House with a comprehensive update on measures to help senior workers stay gainfully employed and improve the quality of their jobs?Productivity of Older WorkersMr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied): Sir, support our older workers to improve their productivity helps provide our older workers with the choice of working longer if they wish, representing an opportunity to stay economically active, socially engaged at work and better provide for themselves in future retirement and, of course, work to the best of their ability. May I ask the Ministry for an update of its plans in the area?The Chairman: Assoc Prof Walter Theseira. Both cuts, please.Employment of Older WorkersAssoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member): Chairman, first cut. The new Senior Employment Credit (SEC) addresses the employability of older workers. However, the evidence linking employer wage subsidies to increasing employment is not encouraging. Studies of similar programmes in Belgium, Finland and Germany suggest that subsidies have small effects on increasing employment among older workers and on reducing early retirement. Thus, most of the subsidy is a deadweight loss, a transfer to the employer with no policy effect.What lessons were learnt from the existing Special Employment Credit, including Additional SEC and how were they used in designing the new SEC? How has retention of older workers and new hiring of older workers, improved since the existing SEC was introduced? To what extent have these improvements been caused by the existing SEC? And what targets have been set for the new SEC?Better Retirement Savings Match DesignSecond cut, Chairman. Budget 2020's Matched Retirement Savings Scheme is an important policy to address the retirement savings shortfall among lower income Singaporeans. However, academic research suggests that Government subsidies for retirement savings have little to modest effects on actually encouraging people to make voluntary contributions to retirement savings, or, to increase those contributions.Engelhardt and Kumar show that increasing the employer savings match rate for company-sponsored retirement account plans in the US generates little improvement in retirement account participation or savings.Raj Chetty and co-authors find that tax subsidies in Denmark have little effect on increasing total retirement savings. They estimate $1 in government subsidies only generates one-cent in additional savings. This is for two reasons. First, the majority of workers – 85% – they are passive savers who do not respond to Government policies to encourage savings. Second, the remaining 15%, largely just shift money from their private savings accounts, to their tax-subsidised savings account.A randomised experiment in the US by Esther Duflo and co-authors offered a 50-cent match for each dollar contributed to retirement savings. However, only 14% of subjects made contributions in response. Although this is much better than the 3% of subjects who contributed without any match, the experimental context is important. Subjects were deciding how to use their US tax refunds and were not contributing out of pocket.I have previously argued this means we should move away from Government subsidies for voluntary saving, such as our SRS and CPF tax deduction policies, in favour of Government matching contributions for all mandatory CPF savings, or to all citizens in general. Nonetheless, how we implement Budget 2020's Matched Retirement Savings Scheme could be more important than the dollar amount itself in encouraging retirement savings.Behavioural economics research suggests people fail to save for retirement due to a combination of loss aversion and procrastination. To address loss aversion, we can ask people to contribute out of future income, rather than out of pocket. To address procrastination, we can ask people to make a commitment to contribute, which becomes a passive action in the future. This avoids needing to make an active choice each time a contribution is due. These behavioural principles are summarised by Benartzi and Thaler as \"Save More Tomorrow\".To improve take-up of the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme, we could ask eligible Singaporeans to commit to contribute part or all of their future Government payouts to their CPF account. Such payouts could include the GST Voucher-Cash, the Workfare Income Supplement cash payout and one-off payments, such as the Care and Support – Cash payout.We can also ask employers whether workers can commit to contribute part of future work income, such as the Additional Wage Supplement, annual bonuses and annual wage increments, to their CPF account for the savings match. Such commitments must be revocable any time before the CPF contribution is made, in case cash is needed urgently. The key is to set up a commitment to contribute in the future, to deal with loss aversion and procrastination.I understand that a pilot study for the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme has shown very encouraging results, supported by strong local academic research from Profs David Chan and Benedict Koh at SMU.I urge the Government to continue building research into the policy of implementation through randomised controlled trials so as to discover the most effective means of getting high take-up of the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme.Securing Financial SecurityMs Foo Mee Har (West Coast): Sir, with people living longer, the ability to meet essential living expenses and maintain standards of living they expect in retirement years is a key concern amongst Singaporeans.Whilst CPF LIFE plays a key role in providing the basic level of retirement income for every Singaporean, it is inadequate as the sole source of post-retirement income to support a \"reasonable\" standard of living in retirement, unless the retirees are willing to make substantial compromises in their desired lifestyles, through to the end of life.According to G30's \"Fixing The Pension Crisis\" report published in 2019, the estimated gap between the expected lifetime financial security benefits and that which existing systems are likely to provide is expected to be huge, that is US$15.8 trillion by 2050, for the 21 countries analysed, including Singapore. A key policy recommendation of the report is to increase private savings with reforms to minimise investment managementcosts and enable individuals to benefit from collective investment management, at lowcost, yet protecting the retirement savings from unprecedented low and negative interest rates and volatility of market cycles.So, in Singapore, it has been more than three years since the CPF Advisory Panel highlighted the significant investmentcosts and risks faced by retail investors in the current CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS). The Panel had recommended that the Government introduce a new scheme, CPF Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme (CPF LRIS) as a prudent, professionally managed, low fee option for CPF members to invest and grow their \"surplus\" CPF retirement savings.With 22 billion currently invested in CPFIS and another estimating 142 billion investible CPF in ordinary account (OA), CPF members are potentially missing out on significant opportunity to augment their retirement savings.With CPF LRIS, members can potentially see their averagecost of investment go from 2% to 3% per year as retail clients, to below 0.5% with the economies of scale accorded by a Government-sponsored scheme. The improvement in net investment returns from the reduced investmentcosts, as well as the benefits from a professionally managed life cycle fund, will significantly improve retirement adequacy especially if compounded over a long term period.For example, I calculated. Over a 30-year period, a savings of 2% in investment managementcost will translate to almost doubling the original sum, even before accounting to the growth of the underlining amount. I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the progress of CPF LRIS? What are the difficulties and concerns in launching such a scheme?CPF ContributionsAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member): Chairman, Sir, last year in August, the Government announced that the CPF contribution rates for older workers would be increased gradually starting from 2021 and carried out over the next 10 years. The full rate of 37% would be restored for workers aged 56 to 60, while workers aged 61 to 65 would see an increase to 26% and those aged 66 to 70 would see an increase to 16.5%.I have called for the restoration of the full rate for all older workers, but I can also understand the Government's position that there is a need to balance the demand-side of the labour market, that is, the employability of older workers who are usually more expensive for employers, and the supply-side, that is, the incentives and sense of worth for older workers to remain in the labour market.I understand this balance is worked out in intense tripartite discussions between employers, unions and the Government.Beyond tripartite discussions, my question is whether there is scope and flexibility for the Government to spearhead changes when it can be shown that the increased rates are not attractive enough to retain productive older workers to remain in the workforce and that demand for workers remain high in labour-constrained Singapore.Also, is the Government still committed to the first increase in CPF contribution rates in 2021? I believe Senior Minister of State Heng Chee How said the Government is. Minster Josephine Teo also said last year that the Government was committed despite the economic uncertainties faced by businesses in the context of the US-China trade war.Now that the COVID-19 emergency is certain to hit the global economy and our open economy hard, I hope the Government is still committed to an increase.CPF Usage for Education and Re-skillingMs Sylvia Lim: Chairman, during the debate on the Budget Statement, I had asked whether it was time to consider other approaches to support mid-career transitioners, such as enabling CPF members in their 40s and 50s to tap on their CPF savings to chart their own continuing education and re-skilling. The Minister had responded briefly to reject the suggestion, stating that thecost of training was not the main issue and that retirement adequacy should not be undermined. I would like today to elaborate on whycost has been an issue for some, and why such a proposal need not affect retirement adequacy.We are all aware of the Adapt & Grow initiatives and how they dovetail into the Government's Industry Transformation Maps. These give effect to the broad national plan to enable the workforce to have relevant skills to take on jobs that are projected to be in demand now and in the future economy.I appreciate the deliberations, consultations, planning and resources that have been devoted to this national endeavour, which has helped many mid-career employees find meaningful work in new industries. Indeed, many courses endorsed under these frameworks are relatively low-cost and accessible.However, there are also other mid-career transitioners who will not be content with these offerings. Some have remarked to me that to set themselves apart in a soft job market, they did not want a certification that so many others were already getting but to chart their own paths. Some may already have tertiary qualifications and wish to do post-graduate courses in new areas conducted by overseas universities or professional bodies. Others may want to venture to work abroad, where the skill areas in demand may not be the same as those under Singapore's economic transformation plan. For these mid-career transitioners, the passion to take ownership of their own futures should be commended.Yet, such mid-career transitioners may have multiple financial commitments and will hesitant to dig into a significant portion of their current liquid savings to undergo unsubsidised andcostly re-education and re-skilling. It is in this context that I am suggesting that the Government look into the feasibility of enabling CPF members to tap on their CPF savings to fund their re-education and re-skilling.I agree that retirement adequacy will always be the over-arching aim of the CPF savings scheme. However, re-skilling potentially leads to better salary outcomes and could pay for itself. This is important at a time where retirement and re-employment ages are moving up.2.30 pmThe Government could always put in safeguards, such as has been done with the CPF investment schemes. For CPF members currently in their 40s and 50s, there are probably significant numbers whose CPF savings exceed their applicable Minimum Sums, even before they reach 55. The Government could consider enabling these members to make such withdrawals.Contribute-As-You-Earn (CAYE)Mr Chen Show Mao: Sir, the Ministry has taken a step towards buttressing the retirement adequacy of freelance workers in our economy with Contribute-As-You-Earn (CAYE) model for MediSave, whereby contribution is made as and when a service fee is earned. May I ask the Ministry for an update on the progress in the implementation of CAYE and an update of its plans in the area?The Chairman: Mr Patrick Tay, take both your cuts, please.Review of the Industrial Relations ActMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan: The Industrial Relations Act was amended in 2015 to permit rank-and-file unions to collectively represent executive employees. In order to avoid conflicts of interest and undermining management effectiveness, executives with senior management functions were excluded from collective representation. These functions are set out in section 17(3) of the Industrial Relations Act. The tripartite partners have also issued the Tripartite Guidelines on Extending the Scope of Union Representation for Executives.In the years that have followed, unions which have sought to extend their scope of representation to include executives have met with some difficulties, mainly due to the overly general way in which exclusions in section 17(3) have been worded.On the ground, our unions have come across instances where employers cite section 17(3) to deny collective representation for executives who are not really in senior management grades or having access to information which would give rise to a genuine conflict of interest if they should be represented by the union.The unions' experience, therefore, is that the exclusions set out in section 17(3) are too broadly worded, thereby giving employers the opportunity to claim that even mid-level executive employees fall within them, whereas the intent behind the law was only to exclude those who are at senior management levels and carrying out functions which genuinely give rise to a conflict of interest if they are represented by a union.Besides this, there are other areas, such as the status of Collective Agreements during a Judicial Management or Receivership and whether the scope of coverage of the Collective Agreement can be limited to union members only, and several other procedural and technical areas which are unclear.I would like to suggest that a tripartite work group be formed to look at reviewing the Industrial Relations Act and addressing some of these areas of concern. This will help to better reflect the true intent of the law, look after the interests and welfare of workers and help employers and unions to reach consensus on extension of scope and other areas of industrial relations smoothly and expeditiously.Review of Trade Unions ActMy second cut on the Review of Trade Unions Act. In light of the expected growth of freelance workers or what many term as the \"gig economy\" in the next five to 10 years, the labour movement hopes more can be done to enable this group to become union members so that they, too, can enjoy the plethora of membership privileges NTUC and our unions offer. At present, the Trade Unions Act requires a person to be in a \"contract of service\" to join a trade union. Freelancers who are in a \"contract for service\" may not be full-fledged union members per se. As such, I suggest for MOM to work with NTUC to review and study this with a view of removing or relaxing the prohibition and explore ways to allow freelancers to be union members without compromising or contravening traditional collective bargaining and representation.The Chairman: Mrs Josephine Teo.The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo): Mr Chairman, let me start by updating Members on the labour market in 2019.Despite the economic headwinds, employment growth was better than expected. Retrenchments remained low. Singapore citizens continued to earn higher incomes in the recent five years. In fact, if we look back over a longer period since 2015, the employment outcomes for our people have been very positive overall. We have provided a handout to Members. It is in the folder that has been distributed.However, the outlook for 2020 has become very uncertain. Given the COVID-19 outbreak, it would be unrealistic to expect employment growth of the last few years. It will also be a challenge for unemployment to remain in the relatively low range of recent years. These unfavourable conditions demand a united response from all of us.Our first priority is to prevent large-scale job losses. Particularly for those earning lower salaries, we should also prevent a scaling back or reversal of wage increases. This is why the biggest bulk – 60% of the Stabilisation and Support Package announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng – goes towards Jobs Support and Wage Credits.Beyond immediate relief, we must not neglect future challenges. In the longer term, we need businesses to transform and keep creating good jobs. We want wages at the lower end to move up more. We also need to help Singaporeans adapt to changing job requirements brought about by technology. The resident workforce will not expand as much as before and we have more seniors.We will need to help both businesses and our people make the best of the opportunities available. At the same time, we must address their anxieties and be sure to walk this journey together.MOM’s responses centre on the belief that there must be fairness at work, for both individuals and employers. This is essential to maintaining cohesiveness in an open economy – to give our workers fair chances to progress, and our businesses fair support to succeed.I will be speaking on four areas: fair opportunities, fair hiring, fair competition and fair support.Many Members of Parliament also asked that we offer more help to self-employed persons (SEP) who have been hard hit. I share their concerns and will announce more measures to support our freelancers.Minister of State Zaqy will elaborate on how we can give fair support for lower wage workers and employers of persons with disabilities. He will cover foreign workers, as well as their employers.Senior Parliamentary Secretary Yen Ling will elaborate on how we are providing fair opportunities for women, as well as fair support for foreign domestic workers and their employers.Let me first start with fair opportunities. Our aim is to give every Singaporean every opportunity to progress at every stage of their working lives. Last year, we placed more than 31,000 local jobseekers in jobs through the Adapt and Grow initiative, similar to the number in 2018. More than half were aged 40 and above. Nearly one-third of placements were aged 50 and above. The share was even higher for rank-and-file workers.In fact, since 2016, the Adapt and Grow initiative, which includes the Career Support Programme, has helped over 100,000 jobseekers get placed. But we are mindful: the work is never done. Therefore, Workforce Singapore (WSG) continues to enhance its service and programme offerings. For example, MyCareersFuture.sg has new features to help employers identify suitable candidates.One particular group we have been thinking about are Singaporeans in their 40s and 50s. They, too, deserve fair opportunities to progress in their careers. We recognise that it is a daunting task for anyone in the middle of their careers to reskill for new jobs. This was highlighted by Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Ms Jessica Tan and other Members of Parliament.In response, the Government has put together the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package. Let me take a step back to outline the thinking behind the package and what we aim to achieve.Mid-career individuals generally hope that their time invested in training leads to a job. That is why many programmes are \"Place-and-Train\" – a jobseeker first secures placement with the employer or attachment with a host company on the strength of his existing work experience and undergoes additional training to close the skills gap to fully meet job requirements.Most participants on such programmes start their training only after they have been placed with an employer or a host company. Forty-nine-year-old Shah Jehan Haniffa and 61-year-old Low Kok Chuen are two examples. Despite limited experience in the logistics industry, Shah Jehan secured a job with ST Logistics through the PCP for Logistics Executives. Low Kok Chuen decided to start work again after two years in retirement and enter a new industry. Delphic Manufacturing Solution saw his potential and hired him through the PCP for Technical Sales Engineers or Managers.Since 2016, \"Place-and-Train\" programmes have benefited nearly 14,500 Singaporeans. Today, we have no shortage of such programmes. For PCPs alone, we have around 100 across around 30 sectors. We have also started moving upstream.To Mr Patrick Tay's question, in the last two years, over 2,000 PMETs were reskilled and redeployed within the same companies, well before they became redundant.To Ms Sylvia Lim's question, capacity is rarely the issue. Nonetheless, to support more mid-career individuals who may be affected by the faster pace of business transformation, we will expand capacity in such programmes. A good example is the TeSA Mid-Career Advance programme announced earlier by Minister Iswaran. In particular, for workers in their 40s and older – like Shah Jehan and Low Kok Chuen – we aim to double annual placements to around 5,500 by 2025. This is the first pillar of the Mid-Career Support Package.Even then, Members of Parliament, like Mr Ong Teng Koon, are rightly concerned about employer commitment becoming the bottleneck. Indeed, when programme capacity is not fully taken up, it is often because employers are hesitant. Especially when prospects are uncertain, employers might hold back and wait for better conditions or a candidate with better match.On the other hand, employers continue to tell MOM their frustrations that mid-career jobseekers shun certain occupations or industries. Jobseekers may lack awareness of the opportunities or confidence in their abilities to adapt to new work environments. Some employers also need to improve job quality to make them more attractive.Therefore, beyond expanding the capacity of reskilling programmes, the Mid-Career Support Package must empower individuals and enable employers. One key pillar of the Mid-Career Support Package is the additional top-up of SkillsFuture Credits. This aims to empower persons in their 40s and 50s to refresh their skills to complement their employers' training investments. Bear in mind that many courses are already heavily subsidised by the Government, up to 90% in some instances. This additional top-up will mean even lower out-of-pocket expenses.At the same time, besides \"Place-and-Train\" programmes, we will ramp up \"Train-and-Place\" programmes. These programmes do not require employer commitment upfront. But, as long as the programmes are well designed to plug skills-in-demand, participants have a good chance of getting job placements after they are trained.At MOE'sCOSdebate, Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat will share more details. I hope it will persuade Ms Lim that actually you do not touch CPF. Even the Institutes of Higher Learning will be able to offer very good opportunities to help mid-careers progress.For \"Place-and-Train\" programmes, all trainees receive full salaries or allowances. For example, during the nine months of the PCP, Shah Jehan, whom I cited earlier, received full salary from his employer – 90% of which was subsidised by the Government.In other words, although we do not have unemployment insurance in Singapore, we have programmes that provide income support to unemployed persons who are prepared to undergo reskilling, which maximises their chances of returning to work.To empower mid-career individuals, another important pillar is our career advisory system. This is the scaffolding and hand-holding that I spoke about in response to Ms Sylvia Lim's points during the Budget debate. Today, this capability resides in several agencies.2.45 pmWSG and NTUC's e2i have been offering employment and training assistance for well over a decade. Since the SkillsFuture movement was launched, the five Community Development Councils (CDCs) have also been mobilised. Through SkillsFuture Advice workshops, more than 100,000 Singaporeans have gained a deeper understanding of their skills and how they can keep abreast of industry developments to stay relevant in their careers.About three years ago, we roped in the private sector. Two best-in-class operators with good track records in other countries were appointed to supplement Government efforts in career-matching.Sector agencies are also involved. Last year, for example, MAS and the Institute of Banking and Finance released a joint study on the impact of automation and data analytics on 121 job roles in financial services. I know that Mr Patrick Tay read this publication from cover to cover. Amongst several outcomes, the Technology in Finance Immersion Programme was launched. Mr Henry Kwek and Mr Leon Perera will be reassured to know that other agencies are conducting similar studies to help with workforce and career planning.Workforce Singapore (WSG) has also intensified support to jobseekers through a suite of high-touch career coaching programmes.The Career Recharger module equips discouraged jobseekers with a positive mindset for their job search journeys. The Career Catalyst module offers one-on-one coaching to help jobseekers uncover their strengths and career options. The Career 360 module helps jobseekers access networks to widen their job opportunities.In this regard, peer support can be very useful. There is untapped potential in our professional communities where many seasoned professionals have rich experiences to share. They are plugged into the challenges and opportunities in their respective fields, have established networks and may themselves have navigated career transitions.We can therefore complement our team of full-time career coaches by building up a pool of volunteer career advisors. Career advisors will receive training to provide sector and occupation-specific career advice and outline career options. Career Advisors will also be equipped with in-depth knowledge of resources and channels of support such as the Adapt and Grow programmes. In short, we hope that the career advisors can help to boost the confidence of their mid-career peers in charting the way forward.At the same time, as the institutes of higher learning ramp up Train and Place programmes, they will also need to be better at providing career advice to mid-career individuals. MOM and MOE will work together to consolidate our resources and boost our collective capabilities in empowering individuals to take charge of their careers.In terms of support to employers, the priority is to bring down thecost of recruiting and training for mid-career jobseekers. We must also keep up the pace of business transformation and job re-design.From 1 April, we will boost salary support for all workers aged 40 and above enrolled in Place and Train programmes from 70% to 90%. This pillar comes on top of very generous funding already available for the training components. Essentially, the Government will underwrite almost the entire salary and trainingcosts of mid-career recruits for the period of training.Further, we will provide a new incentive for employers who hire workers aged 40 and above, through any Place and Train or Train and Place programme. This pillar comes on top of the salary support during the training period. It will cover 20% of the new hire's monthly salary for half a year, capped at $6,000 in total.Senior Minister of State Heng Chee How will be pleased to know that the enhanced employers support extends to workers above age 60. Depending on the duration of training, this means employers will get salary support of up to one year in most cases. This is not even including the Senior Employment Credit, which I will talk more about later.Beyond these two pillars, the Government is providing another two pillars of support for employers to implement business and workforce transformation plans. That is the reason for the $10,000 SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit which MTI has highlighted.Through the enhanced Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG), we will also provide up to 70% funding for companies to engage job re-design consultants. This is important for ensuring that jobs become more attractive, especially to mid-career individuals and seniors. Most of the remaining 30% out-of-pocket expenses can be paid off using the new SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. In other words,costs will be very minimal, for SMEs in particular.Mr Douglas Foo and Mr Gan Thiam Poh were understandably concerned that employers may no longer be short of training funds but training time. For companies with a clear plan to transform their business, MOM will consider supporting them with transitionary manpower. Others may take advantage of the current downtime to increase training hours.Through the five pillars of the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package, we will be investing close to $750 million in the re-skilling and placement of mid-career workers over the next five years. Taken together with the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit and the enhanced Productivity Solutions Grant, we are providing a very significant boost – about $1 billion – to the employment prospects of Singaporeans, especially those in their 40s and 50s. They are a clear commitment to ensure Singaporeans have fair opportunities to progress at every stage of their working lives.At the same time, we will need employers to uphold the culture of fairness at the workplace. This means taking care to ensure there is no discrimination of any kind.In Singapore, where the workforce includes foreigners, we are particularly watchful about discrimination against locals. Under the Fair Consideration Framework, or FCF, we require employers to advertise on MyCareersFuture.sg before submitting Employment Pass (EP) applications. This is to ensure fair hiring and guard against job openings being restricted to \"closed circles of friends\".Mr Murali Pillai pointed out that job positions with salary of $15,000 and above are currently exempted from the FCF job advertising requirement. This threshold was last updated in July 2018, when we also required smaller firms with at least 10 employees to advertise. From 1 May 2020, MOM will expand the advertising requirement to include positions paying up to $20,000. Positions that are more senior remain exempted as they are more likely to be market-sensitive.As for intra-company transfers, which Mr Patrick Tay asked about, they need to meet strict criteria to qualify. As a result, they have constituted a very small share of EP applicants.I will take this opportunity to remind employers not to treat the advertising requirement as a paper exercise. MOM has started to use data analytics to scrutinise EP applications. I cannot tell you too much about it. For example, I cannot tell you what the algorithm is. That would not be wise.We also actively follow up on leads provided by whistle-blowers.Members will appreciate that this is a laborious exercise. Sometimes, disgruntled employees or competitors send us on a wild goose chase. Employers may also use delay tactics to frustrate us. Nonetheless, if we uncover evidence that an employer had pre-selected a foreign candidate and did not give fair consideration to qualified local applicants, we will reject the EP application and ban the employer from hiring or renewing foreign workers.Under the FCF, MOM has also proactively identified employers suspected of nationality-bias in their hiring. We look out for employers with exceptionally high share of foreign PMETs compared to their industry peers or high concentrations of single nationalities. These employers are put on an FCF Watchlist, where all of the EP applications will be scrutinised or withheld.Among other Members of Parliament, Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked for an update of these efforts. I informed Parliament last year that MOM had put about 600 firms through the FCF Watchlist. We have since cast our net wider and scrutinised about 1,000 firms.To date, a total of 3,000 EP applications have been rejected or withheld by MOM, or withdrawn by the employers. In addition, firms under the FCF have hired more than 4,400 Singaporean PMETs over the same period.Our objective is not just to penalise errant employers. We want them to improve. This is why we reached out to another 350 employers whose workforce profiles give us cause for concern, so that they take additional steps to strengthen local hiring. But it also means that having served notice to these employers, MOM will not hesitate to put them on the FCF Watchlist if their workforce profiles deteriorate.Nationality bias is only one form of discrimination. I agree with Mr Lim Biow Chuan that we should take firm action against all forms of discrimination. This is why I announced earlier this year stiffer penalties for discrimination by age, gender, nationality or mental health condition. Employers that violate the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices will be barred from hiring new foreign workers or renewing existing ones for a minimum of 12 months, up to a maximum of 24 months.In January 2020, MOM released the details of five employers that were penalised under this new framework. We have taken action against another 18 more, bringing the total to 23 employers sanctioned under the new penalty framework in just over two months.In one case, a 51-year-old applying to be a receptionist was told that she was \"too old\". That means me too. MOM discovered that the firm had a policy where only candidates younger than 45, female and Chinese, would be invited for interview. So, we have acted against this employer.We will also hold culpable key decision makers responsible, whether it is the chief executive officer (CEO), the chief human resources officer (CHRO) or line managers. We are prepared to name them publicly and revoke their work passes if they are foreigners.Some people may feel that the penalties are still not enough. A 24-month debarment is actually quite painful. Most of the work passes will expire during this period but none can be renewed. Neither can the employer hire new foreign workers. In other words, these employers would need to hire more locals if they want to continue their operations in Singapore.MOM will also prosecute employers and key personnel who make false declarations on fair consideration. One employer has been charged so far. If found guilty, the penalties are up to two years of imprisonment and fines of up to $20,000.We will continue to remain vigilant against discriminatory employers and take firm action against those who try to circumvent our fair hiring requirements. But we cannot do this alone. Workers who come across workplace discrimination should surface it to MOM or TAFEP. Employers should review employment practices to weed out discriminatory practices. Employer organisations should call out members with errant practices that tarnish their sectors.Besides the assurance of fair hiring, our people want the assurance that they compete on a level playing field. Fair-minded Singaporeans do not expect to be given a free pass but they do expect fair competition, and rightly so.As announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng, we will implement cuts to S Pass quotas for the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors in 2021 and 2023. As he explained, S Passes should not be a means by which enterprises hire low-cost foreigners when qualified locals are available.Miss Cheng Li Hui asked what jobs were available in these sectors and what we were doing to train locals for them. In construction, for example, there is growing demand for PMETs skilled in Building Information Modelling (BIM), to use advanced software to visualise and manage building projects. Many draughtsmen who previously made technical drawings are now taking on more complex BIM roles. Other jobs performed by technicians and engineers will be equally transformed by automation and digitalisation.3.00 pmOur educational institutions already work closely with industries to ensure their students have the right training. From 2017 to 2019, there was an annual average intake of 7,400 Polytechnic students in related courses. For mid-career persons, we have PCPs for BIM Professionals, Marine Engineers, Marine Technicians, and Process Construction and Maintenance Professionals.I am aware that affected businesses may still be worried they cannot find people. It is unlikely that locals will change their minds if work conditions do not improve. But as long as employers are willing to make changes, we will help you.The SkillsFuture Work-Study Programme can help you identify suitable Polytechnic and ITE graduates and help to defray trainingcosts. You can also consider mid-career workers. I have outlined the enhanced support for employers under the Mid-Career Support Package. I urge employers to get in touch with WSG or the relevant trade associations. For example, in the last three years, trade associations and chambers (TCAs) have helped more than 4,500 SMEs recruit mid-career PMETs through the P-Max programme – one programme alone.Besides quotas, we regularly review other measures to control the foreign workforce.To ensure that firms do not hire locals on token salaries just so that they can hire more foreign workers, only workers that are paid above a threshold each month can be counted towards a firm's S Pass and Work Permit DRCs. We call this the Local Qualifying Salary, LQS.We have been regularly updating the LQS to ensure that it keeps pace with rising local wages at the lower end. We last raised the LQS threshold from $1,200 to $1,300 in July 2019.We will be raising it further from $1,300 to $1,400 on 1 July 2020. Most employers of foreign workers are not affected because they do not have workers earning below $1,400. Even for those that are, the extension of the Wage Credit Scheme should provide some relief. In any case, like Ms Denise Phua and Assoc Prof Walter Theseira, I hope employers and their customers do not begrudge the raising of salaries at the lower end.At the S Pass and Employment Pass (EP) levels, MOM regularly updates the salary criteria that applicants must meet to work in Singapore. These criteria take reference from salaries of locals with similar experience and seniority, to ensure that the S Pass and EP holders are of good calibre and do not undercut the wages of our local PMETs. This is why older and more experienced candidates need to command higher salaries in order to qualify for a S Pass or an EP. It keeps the competition fair.S Pass salary criteria were raised in 2019 and this year. We last raised the EP minimum qualifying salary in 2017, from $3,300 to $3,600 per month. We will be raising it from $3,600 to $3,900 per month. This increase is in line with improving wages of fresh graduates of local Autonomous Universities.The salary criteria for older and more experienced EP candidates will be raised in tandem. For example, an EP applicant in his early 40s will need to earn around double the new minimum qualifying salary of $3,900; double of $3,900. This is only fair, considering the skill-sets he or she is expected to have. It helps to ensure a level playing field for experienced local mid-career PMETs.The new salary criteria will apply to new EP applicants from 1 May 2020. However, for EP renewals, they will apply one year later, from 1 May 2021. This staggered approach will moderate the impact on businesses.With these changes, employers should continue to ensure that they have fair and merit-based pay practices, in line with the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices.Anecdotally, we have heard of firms that only raise salaries of the EP holders to meet new salary criteria, while freezing salaries of the local workers, even if the locals are better performers! This is wrong and not in the employer's best interest. Apart from the risk of having their work pass privileges cut back by MOM, such practices will undermine their efforts to retain their local employees.While we are asking a lot more of our employers, we are also providing them with fair support. Likewise, we will keep fair support to the self-employed and for Singaporeans in general to build up their retirement nest-egg.Let me outline the enhanced support for senior employment, which Mr Henry Kwek and other Members spoke about.Over the past decade, senior employment rates among locals have grown steadily. In 2018, I convened the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers to study ways to further support senior employment. It announced its recommendations last year, which the Government has accepted in full.The Retirement Age (RA) and the Re-employment Age (REA) will be raised to 65 and 70 respectively by 2030. To help businesses adjust, each move will be implemented in small steps with sufficient notice.In addition, the CPF contribution rates for senior workers will be raised gradually over the next decade. The first increase will take effect from 1 January 2021. This will not change. The exact timing of future moves will be decided later, but we aim to implement the full increases by 2030.Yesterday, Minister Shanmugam announced that the retirement age for Home Affairs Uniformed Services will be raised from age 55 to 58 by 2030. MOM welcomes this move and will work with MHA and our tripartite partners to similarly review retirement age policies for Auxiliary Police Officers and private-sector firefighters.As outlined in the Budget, the Government will support employers to implement these changes, including creating more age-friendly workplaces. We will do so through the Senior Worker Support Package which will provide up to $1.3 billion in support over three years from 2020 to 2022.Businesses had called for continued Government support for the employment of senior workers, in particular, wage offsets similar to the Special Employment Credit (SEC).The Government has heard these calls. From 2021, through the new Senior Employment Credit, we will provide wage offsets to employers that hire senior Singaporean workers aged 55 and above. For 2021 and 2022, employers will get up to 8% of the wages paid to workers aged 55 and above. Similar to the Special Employment Credit, more support will be given for those in higher age bands.The employment rate for workers aged 55-59 has improved greatly and is now close to that of the 20-64 age group. Hence, wage offsets for the 55-59 age group will be 2% in 2021 and 1% in 2022.We will instead focus resources on the older age groups which have lower employment rates. Wage offsets for those aged 67 and above will be the highest, at 8%. Overall, companies will get $660 million in Senior Employment Credit over two years.In 2021, we will offset half of the increase in employer CPF contribution rates through the CPF Transition Offset scheme. Companies will receive about $80 million.We are not depending on the SEC alone to senior employment.We encourage progressive companies to raise the RA and REA ahead of legislative schedule. And to do so, we will introduce a Senior Worker Early Adopter Grant (EAG). Companies can get up to $250,000 each under this grant.Through the Tripartite Workgroup's public consultation and other surveys, senior workers told us they would like to reduce their work intensity gradually as they approach retirement. It makes a lot of sense. They are also more prepared to remain in the workforce if they can undertake part-time work arrangements during the re-employment phase.While the Tripartite Workgroup explored legislating the provision of part time re-employment, employers expressed serious concerns. Many employers today provide mostly full-time positions. Their work structures and processes cannot support workers on partial shifts, or job sharing of full-time positions. This explains our relatively low part-time employment rate for seniors.The Workgroup agreed on a promotional approach to give employers time to adjust. To give these efforts a bigger push, we will introduce a new Part-Time Re-employment Grant (PTRG) that provides up to $125,000 to each company that commits to providing part-time re-employment opportunities to eligible senior workers upon their request. This will benefit seniors who prefer lower work intensity, thereby encouraging them to stay in the workforce. Both the EAG and PTRG will provide support of $100 million to companies over three years.In total, we estimate that up to about 110,000 companies and 570,000 workers will benefit from the Senior Worker Support Package.Mr Chairman, let me now address the concerns of self-employed persons. Based on our most recent survey, the share of individuals who took on self-employed work as their main job remained stable at around 8% to 10% of our resident workforce.Most of our SEPs have a preference for self-employment over regular employment. A small number would actually prefer to be in regular employment but could not find suitable openings. We encourage them to approach WSG or e2i which will help them through the relevant programmes.While some SEPs ponder their longer term plans, the immediate concern of all is the significant drop in earnings due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Sector agencies are stepping in to help those directly impacted. For example, MOT has put together a $77 million package to help taxi and private hire care drivers. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) is also providing licensed tour guides with short-term relief.SEPs in other occupations may see lower earnings because their clients have delayed projects or postponed bookings. This is, no doubt, a period of difficulty. But it is also a window of opportunity for skills upgrading.I will therefore introduce a new SEP Training Support Scheme, which I believe Mr Patrick Tay, Mr Ang Hin Kee, Mr Desmond Choo, Ms Tin Pei Ling and other Members of Parliament will welcome.Over the next three months, all SEPs will be paid a training allowance of $7.50 per hour when they attend courses under the SkillsFuture series, as well as selected sector-specific training programmes. Not only will this scheme supplement their income, it can help them become more future-ready.To illustrate, consider a 45-year-old freelance sports coach or media freelancer who decides to brush up on business management skills by taking a series of courses covering areas such as digital marketing and design thinking. Together, there are six modular courses stretching over 90 hours or about 12 days. With SSG's enhanced 90% subsidy of the course fees for those aged 40 and above, this sports coach or media freelancer would only need to pay about $400 for the course. And by using his SkillsFuture Credit, he will not need to pay a single cent out of his pocket. Furthermore, he will receive training allowance of $675.The SEP Training Support Scheme is a practical way to provide fair support to SEPs in these tough times. The Government will set aside $36 million for this purpose. There is no cap to how much training SEPs can sign up for. NTUC, which has established outreach channels to freelancers, will administer this scheme and release details on how to apply soon.3.15 pmEven as we support SEPs in the short-term, we are also concerned about their longer-term needs. In 2017, the Government set up the Tripartite Workgroup on SEPs. Through extensive consultations with stakeholders, the Workgroup found that most SEPs did not expect their clients to provide employment benefits or to treat them as regular employees. Instead, SEPs asked the Workgroup to focus on addressing their practical concerns. Their preference shaped the Workgroup's recommendations, which have been progressively implemented since March 2018.For example, the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management extended its services to SEPs to help resolve payment-related disputes. We also launched the Tripartite Standard on Contracting with SEPs to promote fair contracting norms and have made good progress. Grab, a major player in the private-hire car and food delivery markets, recently adopted this Standard, joining about 710 other progressive businesses. This means that the 85,000 SEPs engaged by these adopters will be provided with clear written terms to minimise disputes, such as when payments would be made. We call on more service-buyers to do their part by providing SEPs with clear written contracts. We also encourage service-buyers to adopt the Standard, to be more attractive among SEPs.Finally, I will like to provide an update on retirement adequacy, an issue close to the hearts of Singaporeans. We are committed to providing fair support to help our people prepare for retirement. In fact, successive cohorts of Singaporeans have been able to set aside more CPF savings for retirement. Over the last decade, median CPF balances of active CPF members aged 55 have also more than doubled from $71,000 to $155,000. This is because of higher labour force participation and rising wages as well as enhancements to the CPF system, such as the increases in CPF contribution rates and CPF salary ceiling.As a result, even as the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) has been raised gradually for each cohort, more active CPF members have been able to set it aside at age 55, from about four-in-10 a decade ago to more than six-in-10 today. That does not mean our job is done. The CPF is a \"live\" system and must continue to evolve. Incomes continue to rise and so will spending needs in retirement. This is why the Government accepted the Tripartite Workgroup's recommendation to gradually raise CPF contribution rates for senior workers over the next 10 years. By the time we are done with the full increases around 2030, the median member aged 55 can expect his retirement payouts to be boosted by close to 10%.The first increase in CPF contribution rates will take effect from 1 January 2021 but the next steps have yet to be decided. Assoc Prof Daniel Goh asked if we could accelerate the pace. Ideally, we would like to. But this desire needs to be balanced against the impact on the senior workers' employability and take-home pay, factors which he himself had outlined. This is why CPF contribution rates should continue to be stepped down by age and why the Workgroup recommended small increases each time. Given the current pressures on employers and job security, we should proceed with care.Over the years, we have also refined our retirement system to be more fair and progressive. The Government provides higher interest rates of up to 6% on lower CPF balances. The Government also tops up the CPF accounts of lower balance members from time to time, such as the recent Bicentennial Bonus CPF top-up. Targeted subsidies are provided to lower income Singaporeans with lesser means, through Workfare in their working years and Silver Support in retirement. All these translate into substantial support for lower income households in retirement.The Government will take additional steps to strengthen retirement adequacy of Singaporeans. We launched the Contribute-as-you-Earn (CAYE) pilot at the start of the year to help SEPs better save for their healthcare needs through smaller and more regular MediSave contributions whenever they earn income. We expect about 3,000 SEPs or so working with Government agencies each year to make CAYE contributions.To help SEPs come on board the scheme, we will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching for CAYE contributions made in 2020, capped at $600. Mr Chen Show Mao will be pleased to note that around 400 SEPs made CAYE contributions in January alone. This is encouraging. All of them will receive matched MediSave contributions from the Government.SEPs can also save for retirement through cash-top-ups schemes into their CPF. Those who are eligible can tap on the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme, which I will elaborate on later. In addition, SEPs may receive additional support through the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme. From 1 January 2020, the qualifying income cap and maximum annual payouts have both gone up. In addition, recipients will get an additional 20% of their WIS payment for work done in 2019, with a minimum payment of $100. This will be given in cash. Each year, more than 50,000 SEPs receive Workfare. With the COVID-19 situation, I expect more SEPs to qualify this year.More broadly, to help Singaporeans with less CPF savings, we will introduce the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS) from 2021 to 2025. This can benefit lower income seniors and in particular, gig workers and \"unpaid\" care-givers, who typically have less in their CPF.The Government will match cash top-ups made to the Retirement Account of eligible members, up to $600 annually or $3,000 over five years. About 435,000 Singaporeans will be eligible for MRSS each year. There are no restrictions on who can contribute. For example, employers may want to use MRSS as a staff benefit to recognise long-serving senior workers and help them set aside more for retirement. They will enjoy tax reliefs for cash top-ups. Working adults can also make top-ups to their stay-at-home spouses, or their parents who are nearing retirement.Will MRSS work? Assoc Prof Walter Theseira is not so sure and suggested that people be asked to commit their savings in advance, for example, their WIS cash payouts or annual bonuses. I thank him for thinking about how to improve MRSS. We will study, seriously, the practicalities of his suggestion.Let me round off this section with the Silver Support Scheme. Silver Support targets seniors who had lower incomes throughout their lives and have less in their retirement. Since 2016, we have disbursed close to $1.6 billion to over 200,000 seniors.From 1 January 2021, we will do the following: (a) Increase the quarterly payouts by 20% for all flat types; (b) Expand the criteria for lifetime wages; (c) Expand the criteria for household monthly income per person from $1,100 to $1,800, with two tiers of payouts.With these enhancements, close to 250,000 Singaporeans aged 65 and above will benefit in 2021. This is about 100,000 more than today. Total Silver Support payouts will almost double from $330 million currently to about $620 million in 2021.MOM will continue to review our policies to improve the retirement adequacy of Singaporeans. This includes studying the feasibility of introducing the CPF Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme (LRIS), which Ms Foo Mee Har asked about.LRIS will be designed for members who wish to invest their CPF monies but have neither the knowledge nor time to do so. To be attractive, it has to charge low fees. There must be a good chance of earning higher returns than the current CPF interest rates. But it should also provide some assurance against the downside risks.This is a complex effort with many multiple objectives that are not always consistent with each other. Given the many issues that demand MOM's time, I seek Members' understanding that we need more time to get the fundamentals of LRIS right. We will provide an update when ready. Mr Chairman, please allow me to conclude in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Mr Chairman, at the moment, the economic outlook of the whole world is unclear. This is not only due to COVID-19 but also because of technological advancement that is constantly changing the nature of jobs. In the face of these key external factors, Singaporeans may be concerned about their employment prospects.The Government will do everything it can to protect the rice bowls of our people.In particular, those in their 40s and 50s are at a stage of life where they need to support their families. Besides caring for their aged parents and school-going children, and most of them are still paying off their home mortgage. They are worried that even if they work hard, they cannot avoid becoming obsolete.Therefore, the Government has strengthened its efforts to focus on middle-aged workers in their 40s and 50s, so that they can take charge of their careers, explore new opportunities and carve out new careers for themselves.We understand that if we want to help these workers, we need the cooperation of employers and enterprises. Our reskilling efforts would not achieve the intended outcome if they are not supported by employers.We will therefore adopt a targeted approach. If employers are willing to spend time and money to train mid-career and middle-age workers, they would be able to receive 90% salary support.After workers complete training, we will cover 20% of the new hire’s monthly salary, for a duration of six months and subjected to a total cap of $6,000. As they say, the number 66 is symbolic of a smooth-sailing pathway. We hope that employers can keep an open mind, and give more opportunities for mid-career and middle-age workers to play a greater role.In fact, many companies in Singapore are supportive of the Government's policies, especially with regard to hiring senior workers. I would like to thank all of them for their support.As the Chinese saying goes: 家有一老，如有一宝， an elder in the family is a treasure. I hope employers will adopt the same attitude towards senior workers within their companies, and help them achieve their aspirations to work longer and accumulate more savings.The Government will strengthen support for enterprises to achieve this.Those who raise the retirement age and re-employment age before July 2022 will receive grants of up to $250,000. If employers make changes to company policies to allow senior workers to be employed on a part-time basis, they will receive up to $125,000 in grants. In other words, the more \"elders\" they retain or re-employ, the more \"treasures\" they will receive.Let me now talk about self-employed individuals. In the last few weeks, the Government has announced various packages to help taxi drivers, Grab drivers and tour guides. However, the earnings of self-employed individuals in other sectors have also taken a hit due to cancellations or postponements. Hence, the Government will provide an additional S$36 million to help self-employed individuals.NTUC will administer the Self-employed Persons Training Support Scheme to help self-employed workers. If they undergo training under the SkillsFuture Series or sector specific-training programmes, they will receive up to $60 per day for attending the courses, on top of the existing subsidies on course fees. There is no cap on how much training they can sign up for. So, I would urge self-employed individuals to make good use of these schemes. Not only will they enjoy wage subsidies, they can also learn a new skill.As a society, we should pay more attention to assist the more vulnerable groups who have less in retirement.From this year, we will enhance the Workfare programme to benefit more low-income Singaporeans.The Silver Support Scheme has benefited 150,000 workers. From the end of this year, the quarterly cash supplement will increase by 20%. Next year, we will further expand the criteria to include an additional 100,000 senior workers to benefit from this scheme. We will continue to refine these schemes to benefit those with less in retirement.Beyond these initiatives, the Government will help Singaporeans build up more retirement savings to prepare them for retirement.The Government is committed to ensure job security for everyone and look after disadvantaged groups.Even in this time when the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is still unclear, we are fortunate that we still have the means to develop long-term plans to lay a good foundation for our people. I firmly believe that in spite of the immediate challenges and difficulties, we can create a better home for all as long as we work together as one Singapore. [Applause.]3.30 pmBetter Work, Wages and Welfare for Low-wage WorkersMr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol): Mr Chairman, in recent years, NTUC and the Government, with the support of our tripartite stakeholders, have taken bold and specific interventions to help workers providing essential services with better wages, better welfare and better work prospects because every worker matters. The Progressive Wage Model (PWM) has improved the wages and skills of thousands of cleaners, security officers and landscape workers. Other schemes implemented over the years, such as Workfare Scheme, have helped them withcost of living and hope for a better future through new skills that they can acquire at heavily subsidised rates. The road to improving the lives of low-wage workers cannot just end here.In my Budget speech, I am urging the Government to support extending PWM to more sectors if the industry stakeholders are supportive and for us to try wage benchmarking in some sectors if PWM is not practical or feasible. Given that the SkillsFuture framework, identifying different job levels and skills for more than 30 sectors, have been developed, it would be easier to develop the wage ladder for some industries. This would incentivise workers, especially low-wage workers, to upgrade themselves if the prospect for better wages are assured. NTUC will put up some possible sectors and hope the Government will give due consideration.Previously, I have also on several occasions in Parliament made calls for Annual Wage Supplement (AWS) to be made mandatory, especially for low-wage workers, but the response so far has been, at best, lukewarm. Many of us assume that all workers get the 13thmonth bonus or AWS at the end of the year but the sad reality is that the very group that needs it most is not receiving it. As a society, we must demand for the right treatment of our low-wage workers. AWS can boost their salaries by about 8.3% and this can help narrow the income gap. As the Government has pledged to support outcome-based procurement practices, perhaps, the Government and Government-linked companies can also nudge employers towards the right behaviour, to award tenders to companies with good HR practices that include paying the 13thmonth bonus as part of their pay package.I have also called for better protection of low-wage workers against unfair employment contracts and terms. I have highlighted this in a blogpost that I wrote last year. While I applaud the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management for following up on these cases, I would like to know MOM's view about starting a watch list if companies are found or reported to have unfair clauses in their employment contracts and imposing administrative penalties on such companies, such as curtailment of work pass privileges.Lower Wage WorkersMr Chong Kee Hiong: Chairman, most of our lower wage workers are in sectors where their wages have stagnated due to competitive outsourcing practices. The Progressive Wage Model (PWM) puts in place a systematic framework to track the quality of work, gains in productivity and training attained by these workers and peg them to corresponding wage increments and career progression. The PWM has proven to be effective in uplifting workers in the cleaning, security and landscape sectors and improved their prospects.With this successful implementation, I join Mr Zainal Sapari to appeal to the Ministry to consider expanding PWM to even more sectors as soon as possible. In addition, I would like to request for measures to ensure that these workers have access to proper rest areas and safe work environments, backed by legislation and regular enforcement.Employment for Special Needs PeopleMiss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan): Chairman, in Budget 2020, we have the SkillsFuture Support Package for all Singaporeans aged above 25 and one specific to the mid-career so as to encourage and remind them to always stay relevant and keep learning for life. As Minister Josephine Teo has just mentioned, there is also a suite of other support measures on jobs support, wage credit, enterprise grants and so on. It is clear that re-skilling and staying relevant is applicable to everyone and an effort played by all – individual, employers, society and Government.But what does this mean to the people with special needs or disabilities? Some that I spoke to raised the challenges they face at the workplace. For example, they are assigned menial jobs that are not wanted by others; they encounter a lack of jobs after trial employment; SPED schools' academic qualifications are not recognised by the employers, amongst others. In a nutshell, finding and sustaining employment in life for them is a constant challenge.In this regard, I would like to ask MOM what can be done to better facilitate job design and assignment of jobs for people with special needs? Which policy area can be improved to raise awareness and protect their rights at work?Let me share my thoughts on a few areas that the employers, society and Government can do to assist.First, societal mindset change and prevent discrimination at hiring. I think this begins from the design of job application forms where disclosure of medical conditions is required before interviews are granted. How much to disclose and when to do so are always key concerns for these individuals who feel they are disadvantaged from the start. Employers and colleagues can create the right work culture, one that focuses on establishing shared interests and values, building bridges with them and connect through common grounds. They need to be treated as people, not labour. By not emphasising their conditions also means inclusion as all are accepted as one.Second, flexi-work arrangement. There needs to be a better match in mutual expectations, understanding the intrinsic ability of the staff and assigning appropriate task, recognising the contribution and lending emotional support are important. Unfair judgement or bias treatment will only result in clashes or poor work performance. Sometimes, special needs people also require occasional medical treatments throughout their life. Being flexible in work arrangements or time off will help them when annual leave is limited and for those whose physique or stamina are constrained by the number of hours they can put in each day.Third, enhance the dedicated resources of job referral and training organisations. Job coaching, preparatory for workplace and re-skilling are fundamental for people with special needs to continue being in the workforce and remain in the industries. Some form of assistance do exist today but the period of support is short. If the Government and the agencies can play a more prominent role in matching their skills and appropriate employers, this acts as a safeguard for them to remain connected in the industries. Employers and job coaches who value such employees should also be ready to provide testimonials and be willing to offer as their referrals for future jobs. The Government should also look at and consider funding some of these training and provide more wage credit offsets for the employers who hire people with special needs.Lastly, equality in terms and conditions of work. It is not uncommon to hear that people with special needs are often grateful that they are being offered a job and would remain in the job for a long time. But they are, in fact, no different from other workers when they put their heart to the tasks. For that matter, they should be entitled to receive the same contractual coverage and benefits offered by the companies like any other permanent or contractual staff under the same work conditions.I hope to see stronger support and move towards levelling the playing field for people with special needs in the area of employment and lifelong learning.The Chairman: Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar. Take your two cuts together.Support for Persons with DisabilitiesDr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio): The National Council of Social Services (NCSS) published its \"Quality of Life Study on Persons with Disabilities\" in 2016. The study involved close to 1,000 respondents with disabilities. The study incorporated a face-to-face survey which sought to identify the needs of persons with disabilities (PWDs) across six domains of Quality of Life.Among the findings established was that PWDs who were not engaged in a main daily activity, particularly employment, experienced lower quality of life, with more than half of the respondents who were not gainfully employed indicating so. In contrast, those in employment reported a higher level of independence, with a diﬀerence of 10%-16% between those who are employed and those who are unemployed. However, what was more disconcerting is that those who are in open employment, that is, employed just like typical hires, tended to feel discriminated against, with a diﬀerence of 4%-8% between those in open employment and those in sheltered employment or working in Day Activity Centres (DACs).NCSS carried out another study with 1,400 Singaporeans and PRs on attitudes towards PWDs. Among the many findings established in the study, one that stood out was that attitudes towards PWDs were least favourable in the domain of employment. Deeper probing suggests that the public often perceives a person's disability as the inability to perform one's job. In particular, it was found that people in general feel or behave even less positively towards individuals with autism or intellectual disabilities.Information on both studies can be found in this publication by NCSS.As I have said before in this House, being gainfully employed and being able to be remunerated for doing meaningful work, like other typical hires, is a start in helping PWDs or special needs live independently like many others and it accords suﬃcient opportunities for them to develop that much-needed sense of identity, self-esteem and self-dignity.The Government has introduced schemes, such as the Special Employment Credit (SEC), Workfare Training Scheme (WTS) and the Open Door Programme (ODP) to help PWDs with special needs to be employed. However, how many employers actually have, in their hiring policies and practices, aﬃrmative action to employ PWDs with special needs? How many employers have leveraged on these schemes to actively hire persons with disabilities or special needs? And how many PWDs with special needs are in active or open employment?I am also concerned that the Special Employment Credit will cease after 2020. Will there be a new Employment Credit scheme to help employers employ PWDs with special needs? Or can the Special Employment Credit be extended to employers to continue employing PWDs with special needs?In addition, for the SkillsFuture Credit (SFC) of $500 per Singaporean aged 25 years old and above, can an exception be made to allow PWDs with special needs make use of the SFC from age 18 years old when they are in DACs and where they can pick up SkillsFuture training courses while there?I laud the Adapt and Grow and Place-and-Train initiatives available for older workers and for students to upgrade and transition into the world of work across sectors, such as hotel, retail, food services, tourism and air transport.Will there be a similar Place-and-Train scheme for PWDs with special needs to help them ease into their new job and place of work and learn on-the-job? I am sure sectors, such as food services, retail and tourism, are always in need of employees and these are sectors where PWDs with special needs can do well in, provided they are given the opportunity and are coached to perform their job functions well.Finally, how else can employers be nudged into actively hiring PWDs with special needs and valuing them for the skills and abilities that they have, rather than perceiving them as simply being unable to perform job tasks or, worse still, seeing them as a liability?Rest Areas for WorkersMy second cut, Chairman, on rest areas for workers. In last year'sCOS, I brought up the need to provide decent working conditions, such as the provision of proper rest areas for lower wage and outsourced workers, such as cleaners, security oﬃcers, F&B service staﬀ and despatch riders.I had also expressed that while some people may feel that requiring proper rest areas is a trivial request, it is not so. When you work the most part of the day on your feet, you do look forward to having a proper place to sit and rest and experience some sense of well-being while at work. And this rest area should not be at staircases or rubbish dump areas.I had requested for MOM to make proper rest areas for lower wage and outsourced workers mandatory. These rest areas should be well-ventilated, well-lit and have proper tables and seats for the workers to have their meals and to rest. Other than rest areas, there must be proper lockers where personal belongings can be stored safely while they work.I would like to ask MOM for updates in this. How many employers and organisations have agreed to make such a provision for their lower wage or outsourced workers? How is MOM helping employers and organisations make this provision?3.45 pmRight to Flexible Work Arrangement and Mental Health InsuranceMs Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): In the public consultation that my team and I conducted on mental health, there were 76 responses referencing issues within workplaces. The focus of the Ministry on mental wellness within workplaces as part of the WSH 2028 vision is prudent and necessary, as supported also by WHO.Will the Ministry consider issuing an advisory to employers to adopt progressive practices that support their employees’ mental health?Countries, including UK and Canada, have legislated the right to Flexible Work Arrangements (FWA). Twenty-one responses asked for FWAs. One indicated that most treatment options for mental health conditions are only available on weekdays, with their employers unwilling to provide FWAs. Given the Ministry’s strong endorsement for FWAs in care-giver support and Work-Life Grant, would the Ministry consider legislating the right of employees to pursue FWAs and also make explicit publicly that sick leave entitlement can be used for both physical and mental health conditions?Six responses raised lack of mental health insurance as affecting treatment affordability. One respondent shared the inability to claim insurance for treatment at IMH as the company insurer does not allow this. The recent WICA amendment saw the Ministry working with a group of insurance companies to risk-pool and ensure affordable premiums for employers. In a similar vein, will the Ministry consider working with insurance companies on providing mental health coverage for employees?Workplace Safety and Best PracticesMr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang): Chairman, on the night of 7 February this year, there was a fire at a chemical plant on Jurong Island. The fire resulted in the death of two workers, one of which is my resident.When I visited the funeral wake, the family was understandably distraught and they had many questions which the employer did not provide. The company did not explain to the family how workmen insurance compensation worked, did not provide more information on whether the company had bought additional insurance and did not even provide the contact details of a person that the family could approach. No one explained to the family if they would get a factual report of what happened and, if so, from which entity.Chairman, the fire left a Singaporean family with two young boys – six and four years old – without a father. While much work for workplace safety has focused on prevention, I believe MOM must mandate that companies in high-risk industries put in place crisis management and family support best practices to ensure that families get the maximum amount of support when something goes wrong. The situation could even be worse if an accident involves a sole breadwinner.Meanwhile, I would also like to ask MOM to provide an update on our workplace safety and health record over the past year and if it is introducing additional measures to enhance workplace safety and health.Workplace Safety and HealthMr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar): Chairman, according to the latest workplace safety and health statistics released for the third quarter of 2019, the 12-month rolling fatal injury rate per 100,000 workers has dropped to 1.1. This is a new low, but I believe we can strive to do better. To achieve better workplace safety, it is important that we challenge ourselves constantly to make work conditions even safer and healthier for our workers.In 2019, the Government accepted in full the recommendations made by the WSH 2028 Tripartite Strategies Committee. Can the Ministry provide an update on the progress of the respective recommendations made then? I would also like to reiterate my continued repeated calls for a mandatory WSH representative in every company. This will help to support the advocacy and implementation of WSH initiatives at the workplace.Sir, we need also to work towards better workplace health. Mental health, in particular, is vital for our overall well-being. But while mental health issues are real and ever-present, particularly at our workplaces, many are afraid to voice out for fear of stigmatisation. Therefore, we need to raise awareness and socialise mental health issues so that we can build an eco-system of support to help with the detection and early prevention of mental health issues.The Labour Movement will do our part in destigmatising workplace mental health issues. I am happy to announce that NTUC will be partnering with the WSH Council and the Singapore Association for Mental Health to promote mental well-being at workplaces. We will recognise inclusive employers who have gone the extra mile to put in place robust mental wellness programmes to help employees stay mentally healthy and resilient. Through profiling such inclusive employers as industry role models, we hope that we can encourage more companies to do the same. More details will be shared soon.Sir, I note that the Health Promotion Board has been doing its part to promote the creation of mental well-being programmes at workplaces. Since 2017, HPB has trained close to 1,400 managers and HR personnel under the Workplace Mental Health Solution Initiative to support the development of workplace mental health programmes. I would like to ask if there had been any notable initiatives rolled out which can serve as exemplary case studies for other companies to emulate.Sir, we know of two companies who want to support their employees in the area of mental health but do not know where to start. I would like to call on our tripartite partners to partner with the Labour Movement to do more in promoting the training of supervisors and union leaders to identify and respond to employees with mental health conditions. I hope also that the Government will partner with NTUC to study the incidence of workplace mental health issues and the effects, both long-term and short-term, they have on our workforce.By working together to create better total WSH outcomes at the workplace, I believe that our workers will have – to quote Mr Lim Swee Say – a H2P2 life – Health and Happy, Productive and Purposeful.The Chairman: Mr Zainal Sapari, you can take your three cuts together.Mr Zainal Sapari: Chairman, there was a positive trend in the general reduction of workplace accidents but, unfortunately, the spate of multiple workplace accidents involving fatalities among migrant workers in the construction and high-risk sectors last year has cast a dark shadow on an otherwise positive trend in 2019.This begs the question whether the measures taken have been effective in reducing workplace fatalities involving migrant workers. Has MOM concluded if there was any trend, pattern or underlying cause in the spike of accidents in November involving migrant workers, and what pre-emptive measures could have been taken? What is the result of the investigations and, if wrongdoing or negligence is found, when can we expect sanctions to be handed down? Is MOM reviewing rules, increasing enforcement or doing anything else to ensure such spates are prevented in future?I would like to urge our tripartite partners to re-examine the entire eco-system in the industries with many migrant workers to identify weaknesses in workplace culture and practices that could lead to accidents. These gaps must be addressed systematically so that we can have truly inclusive and progressive practices in workplace safety and health because every worker matters and every job counts.Electronic Salary Payment for Work Permit Holders (WPHs)My next cut – Electronic Salary Payment for Work Permit Holders. Since 2014, the Migrant Workers’ Centre has been calling for electronic payment of salaries to be made mandatory for all Work Permit Holders to protect and minimise risk of salary abuse from unscrupulous employers.Although the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act requires employers to switch to electronic payment should the workers request for it, the reality on the ground is that workers would be too afraid to push the issue should the employer refuse, for fear of termination and repatriation by employers. This is an unacceptable consequence to most migrant workers, especially if they have paid high recruitment or placement fees to come here in the first place.Are there statistics on what proportion of the Work Permit Holder population is already paid electronically? Given the success of the MWC-POSB Bank Account-Membership Programme, will MOM be able to say when mandatory electronic salary payment for Work Permit Holders can be a reality?Increase Medical Coverage for WPHsMy last cut – Increase Medical Coverage for Work Permit Holders. The Migrant Workers' Centre has been assisting migrant workers who sustain serious injuries from workplace accidents, including helping many employers discharge their responsibilities to their migrant workers undergoing treatment.Based on the injury cases handled by MWC, they have found that the $15,000 value of mandatory medical insurance coverage for migrant workers is inadequate in assisting employers to defray the unexpectedcosts involving serious injuries. Even though employers can opt for a higher coverage, the reality is that many would opt for the lower coverage to manage their businesscosts. This would make the workers vulnerable if the final treatmentcost is not covered by insurance and the employer is unable to bear thecost.I would like to call upon MOM to initiate and involve the tripartite partners in reviewing the mandatory medical insurance for Work Permit Holders. Perhaps, MOM would want to determine the mandatory insurance coverage based on the industry sector where the quantum of medical insurance coverage would be higher for those sectors which contribute most to the accident and fatality rates. Every worker matters and it is important that they are taken care of in times of need.The Chairman: Order. I propose to take a break now.Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the House.Mr Speaker: Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.20 pm.Sitting accordingly suspendedat 3.58 pm until 4.20 pm.Sitting resumed at 4.20 pm[Deputy Speaker (Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.[Deputy Speaker (Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]Head S (cont)–The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad): Chairman, as Minister for Manpower has shared, MOM will continue to champion fairness. Fairness in the workplace encompasses fair support for both employers and workers. I will share our plans to enable inclusive growth for low-wage workers as well as persons with disabilities, and how we inculcate care for all workers.First, our initiatives for low-wage workers. Over the years, we have improved their wages and skills through various policies. A handout on the achievements of the Progressive Wage Model, or PWM, can be found on Members' seats.Mr Chong Kee Hiong's asked for an update on PWM. The PWM has benefited over 78,000 workers in the cleaning, security as well as landscape sectors by boosting their wages and providing clear paths for career progression. Between 2013 and 2018, real median monthly gross wages of full-time cleaners, security officers and landscape workers grew cumulatively by about 30%, 31% and 32% respectively, higher than the 16% for median full-time resident workers. The current mandatory PWM framework has served us well.In 2018, we announced a PWM for the lift maintenance sector. MND plans to make this mandatory in due course. Meanwhile, the Government is taking the lead by only awarding lift maintenance tenders to firms that have adopted the PWM.Mr Zainal Sapari and Mr Lim Swee Say asked to expand the PWM to more sectors. We have made progress this year. We appointed a tripartite cluster to include escalator technicians under the lift PWM. Together, close to 1,300 resident lift and escalator maintenance workers stand to benefit. The Tripartite Cluster for Lift and Escalator Industry, the fourth such cluster, will aim to submit its recommendations by the end of the year.But we will not stop with these four clusters, and intend to expand the PWM to more sectors. So far, the sectors that implemented PWM have found that a mandatory approach, where a regulator imposes a uniform obligation to comply with the PWM, delivers results most readily. If Government agencies are themselves large buyers of such services, Government procurement policies can also help to kick-start the process.However, the vision of progressive wages, which Mr Lim Swee Say first laid out many years ago as Secretary-General of the NTUC, is more far reaching than that. It is a vision that every sector should have a clear ladder for better jobs, better skills and, as a result, better wages.Therefore, even as we extend mandatory PWM to a few other sectors, we intend to introduce PWM even to sectors where we may not be able to apply mandatory PWM. We want PWM to be a broader movement where the community can play a part as responsible consumers.Under this approach, we want to create a virtuous cycle, where companies that voluntarily pay progressive wages and provide job progression pathways to their low-wage workers, are recognised and rewarded by consumers who support them by purchasing their products and services. This will in turn spur more companies to be progressive as the best way to advance their business interests.We are working actively with our tripartite partners to explore how we can expand the PWM in new sectors and with a new approach. However, we recognise there are current market challenges with COVID-19, and we will have to share more when the economic climate and business conditions are more favourable.Progressive wages are one way to support low-wage workers. The Government also supports them through Workfare. The Workfare Training Support Scheme, or WTS, was first introduced in 2010 to encourage companies to send their lower-wage workers for training, and encourage workers themselves to upgrade their skills. So far, WTS has benefited over 12,000 companies and 270,000 individuals, and disbursed over $550 million. More details are in the handout.I would like to assure Mr Chong Kee Hiong and Mr Saktiandi Supaat that we will continue to provide strong support to low-wage workers to undergo training.We will replace the WTS with a new Workfare Skills Support, or WSS. Over the years, our workers have benefited from the introduction of substantial SkillsFuture course fee subsidies of up to 90% and SkillsFuture Credit for training. The old WTS came at a time before SkillsFuture established itself to what it is today. So therefore there is a fair bit of duplication between WTS and SkillsFuture.Under the new Workfare Skills Support, we will no longer provide course fee subsidies. Instead, WSS will provide more support for workers who complete training leading to full qualifications under the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications, or better known as WSQ, as well as the academic Continuing Education and Training (CET) qualification systems. This is because we have found that those who acquire full qualifications are more likely to earn higher wages.Forty-two-year-old Mr Syamsaini Ramli is one such example. Syamsaini's employer, PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, used WTS to sponsor him for courses that led to a WSQ Certificate in Security Operations – a full qualification. Syamsaini gained new skills in areas such as counter-terrorism and managing threatening behaviour, which his employer valued. He was promoted to assistant security supervisor in 2019, with a pay increment of 10%.We want more workers like Syamsaini to benefit from WSS. Hence, we will raise the Training Commitment Award for low-wage workers who attain a full qualification to $500, from $200. Its annual cap will also be increased to $1,000, from $400.We will also raise the training allowance to $6 per hour, from $4.50, to offset the opportunitycosts of workers' training. We will tie the eligibility for training allowance to courses which are more likely to lead to better employment outcomes. The new WSS will commence on 1 July 2020.Let me turn to the concerns of Persons with Disabilities, or PWDs. Our current programmes to support PWDs have contributed to their improving employment rate. Last year, I shared that three in 10 of PWDs aged between 15 and 64 were in employment. Between 2016 and 2019, more than 2,000 PWDs found new jobs through the Adapt and Grow, or A&G, initiative.The Open Door Programme, or ODP, a special scheme under the A&G initiative, is administered by SG Enable, and helps PWDs enter suitable jobs and better integrate into the workplace. It provides support for job placement, training and job re-design. The ODP Job Redesign Grant provides funding of up to 90% of job re-designcosts, capped at $20,000 per PWD employee. MOM and SG Enable also launched the Job Redesign Guide to help companies better integrate PWDs into the workplace, one of the critical success factors for PWDs continuing to be employed.Last year, more than 5,900 employers hiring over 9,000 Singaporeans with disabilities benefited from the Special Employment Credit, or SEC, and the Additional Special Employment Credit, or ASEC. This amounted to over $102 million since 2012.We want to do more to improve the employment and employability of PWDs. To study this, MSF set up the Enabling Masterplan workgroup comprising of public, private and people sector representatives last year. With the workgroup's support, MOM will be enhancing our schemes to give our PWDs a boost.The workgroup recognised that training and job re-design are key to helping PWDs stay employable. One of the beneficiaries of the ODP Training Grant is David. David was diagnosed with mild retina pigmentosa in his teens, which led to worsening vision over time. He lost his job as an engineer in his mid-50s. David tapped on the ODP Training Grant to pick up workplace IT skills as well as telephone etiquette.The courses prepared him for an alternative career pathway as a call centre agent with Eureka Call Centre Systems, or EurekaCCS. EurekaCCS also tapped on the Job Redesign Grant to purchase keyboards with larger font keys and high colour contrast, allowing employees such as David to work more productively.4.30 pmThe training David underwent gave him confidence to attend to enquiries and feedback from customers and David performed so well that EurekaCCS recognised him as one of their top performing call agents and rewarded him with an additional bonus incentive. In total, EurekaCCS has 14 employees with disabilities, who make up 87% of its workforce. Well done, EurekaCCS! I hope more employers will follow its lead.We will enhance the ODP Training Grant to provide stronger funding support to employers who send their PwDs for training, and PwDs seeking to upgrade themselves. We will raise course fee subsidies from 90% to 95% for eligible training courses curated by SG Enable. We will also raise training allowance for both unemployed and employed PwDs to $6 per hour and introduce a training commitment award of $100 per completed eligible training course.The SEC and ASEC have served our PwD employees well and will expire this year. To replace the SEC and ASEC, we will introduce a new Enabling Employment Credit, or EEC, which will provide even stronger support for persons with disabilities. The EEC will be given to employers that hire Singaporean PwDs earning below $4,000 per month and this will cover about four in five of current PwD employees. The EEC provides a wage offset of up to 20% of the employee's monthly income, capped at a maximum of $400 per month. In addition, employers hiring PwDs who have not been working for at least six months will receive an additional 10% wage offset, capped at $200 per month, for the first six months of employment.Mr Alvin Yeo, the founder of Faith Music Centre, is one employer that will benefit from the new EEC. Faith Music Centre is a social enterprise which teaches music to PwDs and has also hired several of the centre's learners with disabilities as music instructors and stage masters. Today, Faith Music Centre has 15 employees with varied disabilities, including autism spectrum disorder, sensory impairment and intellectual disability. EEC will provide Faith Music Centre a larger wage offset as compared to SEC and even more support if they hire more PwDs.As persons with disabilities become more economically active, the issues of financial independence, whether they enjoy fair salaries, as raised by Dr Intan Azura as well as Miss Cheryl Chan, will become more important to PwDs. MOM will closely monitor workplace practices and encourage progressive practices for PwDs, just as it does for other workers.Under the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, employers are expected to treat PwDs fairly, including asking for information only relevant to the job and paying them fairly. Lower income PwDs also receive additional support through the Workfare Income Supplement. In 2019, over 6,300 PwDs received WIS payouts amounting to $6.7 million. WIS has been further enhanced from 1 January 2020, with a higher qualifying income ceiling of $2,300 per month and higher maximum payouts of $4,000 per year.So, ultimately, the best way to safeguard the interests of our persons with disabilities is to ensure that they have many good opportunities to choose from. This means more employers hiring PwDs and giving them opportunities for career growth. It also means more Singaporeans welcoming PwDs as colleagues in the workplace.Beyond inclusive growth, we want to promote a culture of care. It is important to uphold our workers' dignity and to support them by giving them the respect they deserve. Last year, we launched Workcare, an initiative to uplift the well-being of our low-wage workers. To begin, we are focusing on rest areas. Mr Chong and Dr Intan asked for updates. Last December, we launched the Tripartite Advisory, or TA, on Provision of Rest Areas for Outsourced Workers, and I am happy to share our progress.West Coast and Ang Mo Kio Town Councils, with the support of Mr Patrick Tay and Dr Intan, have partnered MOM to spruce up 20 rest areas for their outsourced cleaners, as a pilot initiative. In sites with space constraints, cleaners asked minimally for means to safekeep their belongings. NEA has worked with their cleaning contractors to provide lockers in 10 MEWR hawker centres, and will do so for the remaining 16 centres by the end of 2020. NTUC Foodfare will also provide lockers in all 12 food courts by the end 2020.I am also happy to announce that all public agencies and Town Councils will lead by example and have committed to adhere to the TA by end 2020 as well. To further accelerate the provision of rest areas in other workplaces, MOM will launch a new Workcare Grant that we will announce later this year, with a view of legislating this in time to come.Singaporeans, we can play a part too. Simple gestures such as thanking these workers for their services, are small but in significant ways that will improve their well-being and dignity at work. Mr Melvin Yong, Mr Yee Chia Hsing and Mr Zainal Sapari raised issues concerning Workplace Safety and Health or WSH, as we all know it. A culture of care includes ensuring the safety and health of our workers. And over the past decade, Singapore's WSH performance has improved. The workplace fatal injury rate last year was no worse than in 2018. More details will be released in the 2019 WSH Statistics Report by next week; so, stay tuned.In response to Mr Zainal, there was no dominant trend that contributed to the fatal accidents in November last year. Investigations are ongoing. Where necessary, we will issue Stop Work Orders to prevent risks to other workers. Stop Work Orders are minimally for three weeks. And companies have to rectify all unsafe conditions before Orders are lifted. If we find that companies or individuals have failed in their Workplace Safety and Health obligations, we will prosecute them.I agree with Mr Zainal that tripartite partners should do more to prevent accidents. This was what many of the WSH2028 recommendations sought to do. We are progressively implementing these recommendations. One of the underlying principles of WSH2028 is to make good WSH good for business.There will then be stronger impetus for firms to embed Workplace Safety and Health in their culture and practices. For instance, this year, we will establish a framework for public sector developers to disqualify unsafe contractors, when considering awarding contracts. Later this year, designated work injury compensation, or WIC, insurers will have access to potential clients' WIC claim records. We expect insurers to set higher premiums for firms with poorer safety records. So, there is an impact to the premiums that you pay compared to how you perform at the workplace.We agree with Mr Yong that every company should have representatives to champion progressive WSH practices. However, making this mandatory in every company may not be practical. In fact, the WSH 2028 Tripartite Strategies Committee concluded that a prescriptive approach is not the way forward. The more prudent approach is to promote this as a progressive practice. We will support the Labour Movement in championing WSH representatives and other progressive WSH practices.I agree fully with Mr Yee Chia Hsing, that support for the families affected by workplace accidents is essential. I too, visited the family; in the constituency that was affected, and certainly, our hearts go out to the family. It was a really tragic accident that I feel is needless. MOM will sensitise employers, including through the Institute for HR professionals, because HR is usually the first interface that the family has with the company.Workplace safety and health covers mental health at work too. Recently, there have been calls to better support employees' mental well-being at workplaces. Ms Anthea Ong asked whether sick leave entitlements can be used for both physical and mental health conditions. This is already the case. In fact, in issuing a medical certificate, a doctor should not indicate to the employer the nature of the patient's medical condition unless the patient has consented to it.All employers are expected to practise fair and merit-based employment practices, as laid out in the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices. For certain jobs such as pilots and Police officers, some mental health conditions may affect their ability to perform their job roles effectively. In these cases, it is reasonable for employers to ask applicants for more information to make a holistic assessment of overall well-being. Otherwise, employers should not be asking for information on the applicant's mental health. Our recent enhanced penalty framework for discriminatory practices also apply to discrimination on grounds of a person's mental health condition.We agree with Mr Yong and Ms Ong that employers have an important role in supporting employees' mental well-being. Today, MINDEF and MOE already have well developed programmes to support their servicemen and educators. We encourage more employers to do the same because your workforce of tomorrow and workforce of today have gone through that system and as they come out into the workforce, they need the same level of support too.Some employers may want to support their employee's mental health, but they do not know how. As Ms Ong has suggested, we will formulate a Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-Being to educate employers on what could be done. The advisory will highlight notable initiatives that companies should emulate, what Mr Yong was asking for. These could include progressive practices such as providing access to anonymised external counselling service, or training supervisors to identify mental health symptoms early. We will also work with tripartite partners and seek views from various stakeholders including members of the newly announced Youth Mental Well-Being Network.Ms Ong suggested including mental health expenses as part of employees' medical benefits. One way is to include it as part of employer-provided medical benefits that complement our healthcare financing offerings, which the tripartite partners can discuss in crafting the TA later. We aim to finalise the Tripartite Advisory in the second half of this year.The Ministry is also happy to partner the Labour Movement to initiate mental health studies and support employee mental well-being. For instance, together we can promote the use of iWorkHealth, a web-based psycho-social assessment tool to help employers and their employees identify workplace stressors. The tool raises awareness of workplace factors that may cause excessive stress and recommends ways to improve mental well-being. MOM is currently piloting the tool and will launch it later this year.Mr Zainal asked about medical insurance for Work Permit holders. Foreign workers who sustain injuries from workplace accidents are entitled to claim compensation under the WICA Framework. Compensation benefits under the WICA include medical leave wages, medical expenses of up to $45,000 as well as lump sum compensation for permanent incapacity or death. The compensation cap of $45,000 for medical expenses will fully cover the medical expenses incurred in more than 95% of claims where hospitalisation was required.To meet WICA obligations, employers are required to purchase Work Injury Compensation Insurance. This is separate from the mandatory medical insurance that employers are required to purchase and maintain under the EFMA. Under the EFMA, the medical insurance purchase can be used to either supplement the Work Injury Compensation Insurance or be used for non-work injury related treatment; so they are both different.We must always treat all workers fairly and inclusively. As the saying goes, \"treat others how you want to be treated\". This is especially important today, as we face the COVID-19 threat together. As shared last week, MOM is working hard to educate our foreign workers on the COVID-19 situation and the control measures that we put in place. Materials such as posters and videos have been produced and are available in the workers' native language. In addition, MOM has been sharing bite-size information through our foreign worker ambassadors on a daily basis.An employer from a trading company gave feedback that the handling of the COVID-19 situation was efficient and effective. One worker shared that he \"felt no panic about COVID-19\" and that the \"Government took a lot of steps against COVID-19\". But this would not have been possible without our partners – our employers, our unions and our NGOs. We really thank everyone for making this successful.In pursuing inclusive growth in a culture of care for all workers, the Government is committed to ensuring fairness for both employers and workers. We can achieve this with the commitment and support of our Tripartite Partners and fellow Singaporeans. By working together hand in hand, we can build the workforce which provides fair support to all employers and workers in an inclusive, empathetic and caring manner.4.45 pmMr Chairman, allow me to recap how we provide fair and inclusive support to employers and workers in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]MOM will continue to champion fairness and provide fair support for both employers and workers. This includes our lower wage workers and persons with disabilities, or PwDs.Over the years, the Progressive Wage Model, or PWM, has provided progressive wages and job progression pathways for lower wage workers. The PWM has benefited over 78,000 workers in the cleaning, security and landscape sectors.We have seen positive effects. Between 2013 and 2018, wages grew cumulatively by 30% or more for full-time resident workers in these sectors, higher than the 16% for median full-time resident workers.Earlier this year, we appointed a tripartite cluster to include escalator technicians under the lift PWM announced in 2018. It will submit its recommendations by the end of this year.We intend to extend the PWM to more sectors, including those where we may not be able to apply mandatory PWM. We will share more when the economic climate is more favourable.We have also helped lower wage workers upgrade their skills through the Workfare Training Support Scheme, or WTS. Since 2010, it has supported over 12,000 companies and 270,000 lower wage workers.WTS will be replaced with a new Workfare Skills Support Scheme, or WSS. Our study of WTS outcomes show that those who train and acquire full qualifications benefit from earning higher wages as a result. The new WSS will provide higher incentives and training allowances to support workers to achieve full qualifications. It will commence on 1 July 2020.To improve the well-being of our lower wage workers, we will launch a new Workcare Grant later this year, to accelerate the provision of rest areas in workplaces.To improve the employment and employability of PwDs, we will introduce a new Enabling Employment Credit, or EEC, which will replace the Special Employment Credit when it expires this year. The EEC will strengthen support to employers prepared to help PwDs who are new to the workforce or have been out of the workforce for some time, to be integrated into the workplace.In pursuing inclusive growth, the Government is committed to ensuring fairness for both employers and workers. Together, with the support of tripartite partners and fellow Singaporeans, we will be able to achieve this goal.Supporting Women at Every Life StageProf Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman – long hours, shifting responsibilities, minimal feedback, constant multi-tasking and zero training. If you saw a job description like this, would you not run in the opposite direction? And yet, many women take on the important job of care-giving without any pay to speak of.Care-giving for young children, elderly parents or family members with special needs is often a labour of love. But it translates into brutalcosts to women's employability, career advancement, income and retirement savings.Women have much to offer our workforce. Career portal Mums@Work, founded by mumpreneur Sher-li Torrey, supports 43,000 women starting businesses or seeking flexi-work. Data from their 2019 recruitment campaigns demonstrate the talent of back-to-work females. Eighty-four percent had a Bachelor's degree or higher, 53% had managerial experience and 58% had more than 10 years of working experience and this was in critical sectors, such as banking, finance and IT.Despite these strengths, women face structural, organisational and individual factors that obstruct their return to the workforce. One salient structural factor is the achievement orientation in our education system. In other countries, women tend to take time out from work right after childbirth and, therefore, reintegrate into work when younger. In Singapore, women exit the workforce during their children's critical school years, such as entry into Primary 1 and the high stakes PSLE year. Hence, they are relatively older when they return to work, thus facing the double whammy of outmoded skills and ageism.Organisationally, industry feedback indicates that even when companies are prepared to welcome back-to-work women, direct hiring managers still prefer women without career gaps. They believe returning women are out of touch with the industry, less dedicated due to their family commitments or cannot gel with younger co-workers.Even in companies with flexi-work arrangements, individual departments may not adopt them or employees themselves may not request them because of the stigma towards flexi-work. Such prejudices are due to managers not knowing how to manage back-to-work or flexi-work employees. We should, therefore, provide more managerial training to address such organisational issues. Also, we should develop toolkits to help managers onboard and reintegrate returning workers. Flexi-work and back-to-work hire support schemes are also currently pitched as offering support to individual employees. There must be more strategic higher level communication about the benefits that such hiring shifts can bring to the company to influence individual managers' decision making.With the threat of COVID-19, we are currently conducting the greatest telecommuting experiment of all time. I urge MOM to systematically survey employers and employees to understand the potential and pitfalls of telecommuting. We can then identify creative flexi-work solutions and introduce best practices for different industries.We should also consider raising SkillsFuture funding for returning women. Due to their longer career gaps, such women have to write resumes, field interviews and job hunt very differently. Hence, their upskilling has to be more comprehensive and targeted to their particular needs. Those who are planning to return to the workforce will still be juggling care-giving with upskilling. Consequently, they may not be able to attend daylong SkillsFuture courses. Such factors must be taken into consideration in the design and development of SkillsFuture courses to more effectively support these women.Working MothersAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong: Chairman, Sir, according to MOM's Labour Force in Singapore 2019 report, it is estimated that there were 49,000 unemployed women aged 15 to 49 who gave the main reason for leaving their previous job as either \"Housework\" or to \"Care for Own Children Aged 12 & Below\". If we just compare the numbers for those who gave childcare as the reason, there were 19,000 women in their 30s and 10,000 women in their 40s. This suggests that about half the women did not re-enter the workforce after fulfilling their primary childcare responsibilities. I believe we need to do more for our would-be working mothers in the two aspects of exiting and re-entering the workforce.First, we should try to minimise the disincentives and maximise the incentives for working mothers to remain in the workforce. As raised by the hon Member Desmond Choo, this COVID-19 emergency has shown that flexi-work arrangements can work for many jobs and I would like second his call to give working mothers the right to make flexi-work arrangements with their employers when these are workable. Besides flexi-work arrangements, Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) and MOM should take proactive steps to clamp down on practices reflecting \"motherhood bias\", where women are marked as poor performers for juggling family responsibilities while fulfilling their work commitments.Second, the Government is in a good position to help mothers to retrain and update their new skills and reintegrate them into the workforce, especially through various SkillsFuture programmes. I believe a targeted programme for unemployed mothers would be very useful in this respect. The Government could also support community efforts and partner with initiatives, such as the Mums@Work, to encourage mothers to remain working and to return to work.Gender Pay GapMs Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member): Chairman, it is encouraging to see that the adjusted gender pay gap has decreased over the decades, but we should remain concerned at the unadjusted gap which has barely shifted and remains at 16.3% in 2018.One explanation for the gap is the inequality in the division of care-giving responsibilities between gender, which significantly limits the choices and opportunities for women. The need to juggle work and care often results in women ending up in lower paying jobs which offer more flexible or shorter working hours. To tackle this, we can reconfigure workplace culture and enable men to share more equally in care-giving.First, the uptake of paternity and shared parental leave by fathers needs to increase. Reports have found that men who take time off for childcare directly contribute to their female partners' earnings later on in life. According to a study in Sweden – where a family loses some of its designated paid parental leave unless the father takes it – a woman's earnings rose by 7% for every month of leave taken by her husband. Singapore could consider introducing a compulsory quota for men or offer a longer quantum of gender-neutral parental leave for parents to share as they wish.Second, work arrangements can be designed to accommodate care-giving. Employees should have the right to request for Flexible Work Arrangements (FWA). A study on the implementation of FWA found that the organisational cultures of workplaces in Singapore did not normalise or formalise FWA. Employers were also \"wary\" about the change in face-time with employees under FWA, which could \"potentially complicate employee assessment and surveillance\". Legislating the right for employees to request for FWA could institute an organisational cultural shift.Work hours in Singapore could also be shorter. In 2018, Singapore residents worked an average of 44.9 hours a week, the shortest it has been in a decade but still higher than the average number of hours put in by workers in every OECD country. Shorter work hours have also been associated with increased productivity and lower stress levels, according to numerous trials around the world. An overall reduction of work time could allow workers to juggle work and care better.The Ministry can also introduce a dedicated \"returnship\" programme that provides clear employment pathways for women who wish to return to the labour force.Furthermore, the Ministry can also pay more attention to wage levels in female-dominated industries and occupations. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) Committee has recommended that Singapore reduce the gender wage gap by regularly reviewing wages in sectors in which women are concentrated and establishing effective monitoring and regulatory mechanisms for employment and recruitment processes to ensure that the principle of equal pay for equal value is adhered to in all sectors.Employers could also be required to publish gender and disability-disaggregated salary and bonus data and carry out evaluations assessing if pay gaps are due to gender or other forms of discrimination.Workplace Transformation and PracticesMs Jessica Tan Soon Neo: The current COVID-19 situation has led to many businesses having to implement their Business Continuity Plans (BCPs). In a short span of time, many organisations have found themselves willingly or unwillingly implementing flexible work arrangements for a sizable proportion of their workforce. Until recently, for many organisations in Singapore, flexible work arrangement was a way for employers to allow employees who required it, some flexibility of where and when they work.With the current COVID-19 situation, the activation of BCPs involves employees across different roles and levels in the organisation. People have had to adapt. Moving to flexible work arrangements require not only people to work away from the office, but the right tools, processes and even etiquette or work norms had to be established. Some companies and employees moved quite quickly while others are still adjusting.Regardless, we now have quite a large number of organisations and employees on flexible work arrangements. I believe that with many employees now experiencing flexible work arrangements across their organisations, this will influence and change how people work in the future.Technology is a key component to enabling new work arrangements and changing how work is done. This goes beyond just flexible work arrangements to include even shared work and collaborative work spaces. With devices getting smarter, connectivity more seamless, the workplace is no longer a place to get work done. It is now more important that you have the right devices, access to information and connectivity to get your work done. While this will change business norms, it does create new opportunities for both businesses and workers. Benefits include access to talent, business and individual productivity, lowercost for work space for companies and many hours saved from not having to travel to and from the workplace.With the competitive labour market, these new work arrangements may become a staff attraction and retention tool for businesses. I believe that the discussion will move away from flexible work and work-life balance to one of how the boundaries are blurring between work and life as we manage the transformation of how work is done.Shared or collaborative work arrangements provide platforms for sharing of ideas, creativity and even innovation for companies. HR policies and practices, including performance management and benefits, will need to evolve in tandem to support the new way of work. Implementing more flexible and collaborative work arrangements will also require managers to pick up new skills. Could the Ministry share what support programmes are available to assist companies in transforming their businesses and HR policies to support flexible work arrangements and evolving work arrangements?5.00 pmSupport for Flexi-workDr Intan Azura Mokhtar: Flexi-work provisions, arrangement and support have been extensively rolled out during this COVID-19 outbreak period. Employees are placed on rotating teams, or being asked to work remotely or from home, while face-to-face meetings are replaced by e-meetings or e-consultations. Even with some initial inconveniences, we are able to work remotely, flexibly and still fulfill our daily work responsibilities, or even meet our daily business targets, with some creative provisions and solutions in place.I have spoken about the need to support flexi-work for employees for some time. With the current COVID-19 situation, we are somewhat forced to carry out flexi-work provisions and arrangements. I hope flexi-work can be a common feature of our employment landscape and eco-system even after COVID-19. Just as we trust our workers and staﬀ to work remotely or on a flexible work arrangement during this period, we must continue to trust them to give the same amount of commitment, time and eﬀort when the worst is over.Flexi-work is not just for times of crisis or diﬃculty. Flexi-work is also to allow for personal obligations and commitments to be fulfilled, and to cater to diﬀerent work arrangements and work needs.For persons with disabilities or special needs, flexi-work arrangements can provide for better employment opportunities for them to work from home or to gradually adjust to their work environments and work commitments at a pace they are comfortable with. For instance, they can work a few days a week in the oﬃce and a few days from home so that they can still work full-time, fulfill their work obligations but can reduce commuting time and yet have the opportunity to meet with colleagues and interact with them face-to-face in the oﬃce for that much needed social interaction.For individuals with family commitments and obligations, flexi-work can accord them some much needed time to fulfill these commitments and obligations while they work from home or work remotely, while still ensuring work is done and key performance indicators (KPIs) are met.I hope the Ministry will continue to provide the needed support and provisions for flexi-work to continue to be implemented by employers.Job Design for an Engaged Local WorkforceMr Douglas Foo: Chairman, employers have been encouraged to explore flexi-work arrangements to create worklife balance for employees. With such arrangements, through rethinking the work day, or redesign of job functions, employers would in all likelihood find it easier to attract and retain locals and reduce reliance on foreign labour.Today, we find an increasingly diverse workforce. Seniors who would like to remain in the workforce, fathers who take on an active role in parenting, for example. The workforce is no longer homogenous, and as employers, our company policies should respond to such diversity with flexibility.There are various existing incentives to encourage employers to implement such arrangements in their workplace. In the current situation with COVID-19, there is more compelling reason than before for employers to test out and implement some of the flexible work arrangements. This is a window of opportunity that I see here. Will the Ministry be able to share what plans it has to further publicise the flexible work arrangement schemes and encourage the speedy adoption by Singapore companies?Flexi-workMiss Cheng Li Hui: Sir, in an MOM 2018 report, 72% of employees worked in firms which provide formal flexible work arrangements, up from 70% in 2017. The provision of flexible arrangements has a huge impact on staff retention, as the new generation of workers values flexibility a lot more.With COVID-19, many companies have adopted the split-team arrangement, where an alternate team is now stationed at home to support the company's operations. This creates an opportunity for companies to assess and try out flexi-work arrangement and review internal workflows.Post-COVID-19, may I suggest that MOM: (a) follow up with a survey to poll companies and employees on their readiness for flexi-work arrangement; (b) study and access flexi-work arrangements across different industries and sectors; (c) make flexi-work arrangement part of the productivity drive, with less time and money on commuting, reduction of office space and rent; and (d) perhaps form an inter-agency work group with the private sector to study this?Support for Informal Elder Care-giversMr Chen Show Mao: Sir, informal or unpaid care-givers enable other Singaporeans to carry out the economic activities that are figured in our GDP while their own care-giving is not. As of now, the burden of informal eldercare-giving falls disproportionately on unmarried women. Our dependence on this group of Singaporeans is real, is substantial and very often unacknowledged. Eldercare leave and the statutory right to flexible work arrangements could well help relieve some of the pressures on informal eldercare-givers who also work at other jobs.But almost half of our informal care-givers to seniors do not work at other jobs, often because of the unpaid care-giving responsibilities that they have taken on, to their own financial detriment and to their own reduced retirement adequacy. For them, would the Ministry consider measures such as CPF top-ups and cash grants for full-time informal eldercare-givers in low-income households to help reduce the pressure of being under-employed and under-prepared for retirement as a result of taking on the responsibilities of caring for their loved seniors?The Chairman: Mr Louis Ng, you can do both your cuts.Increasing Minimum Annual LeaveMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): Sir, I appreciate that the Government is looking into work-life balance and is introducing several new initiatives. When it comes to work-life balance, Singapore ranks poorly. We rank 32nd out of 40 cities for work-life balance and are second only to Tokyo in a ranking for the most overworked cities.Beyond flexible working arrangements, I hope we can also look into increasing the minimum amount of annual leave one is entitled to. This is not a zero sum game. We can have flexible working arrangements and still give our people more leave.The current minimum of only seven days of annual leave is extremely low. Many other countries in this region provide a higher minimum number of annual leave including Malaysia, Bangladesh, Japan, Myanmar, East Timor, Sri Lanka, Laos, Mongolia, South Korea, Qatar, Yemen, Iran, Kuwait and Indonesia. Many of these countries provide not only a higher number of minimum days of annual leave, but also a higher number of paid public holidays.Our people will always work hard, but we also need to make sure they have time to rest.Providing Parent Care LeaveThis Government recognises that we need to spend time looking after our parents. It has been eight years since we introduced parent care leave in the civil service and it is now time for everyone else to have this. We need to legislate it.Time to spend time with our parents runs out quickly. With a rapidly greying population, time is running out for our Government to act on this too.If the Government feels that it is important for civil servants to have parent care leave, then why not others? We are a family-friendly employer and now we need be a family-friendly Government.Workplace HarassmentMs Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member): Chairman, employers should ensure a safe and inclusive workplace for all workers, regardless of contractual status, by preventing and responsibly handling workplace sexual harassment. Yet, for many Singaporeans, this unwelcome dilemma is a daily reality. In the last year, AWARE handled 212 cases of workplace harassment of women comprising sexual and non-sexual harassment, which suggests that few employers have comprehensive policies and robust training in this area.The Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices guides employers and employees on preventing and managing workplace harassment. However, the Ministry does not track how many employers have implemented the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment. Can the Ministry intensify promotion of the advisory standards to employers, including setting up and maintaining a public database for employers to voluntarily declare that they have written policies to manage workplace harassment?There is no legal duty for employers to follow the tripartite advisory. Many women seeking help from the Workplace Harassment and Discriminatory Advisory at AWARE hesitated at raising a formal complaint with their employers or any other authorities because they did not think that they will be taken seriously. Some worried that there will be no follow-up action to hold their employers accountable. These concerns are usually the result of a lack of proper internal structures for reporting and handling harassment complaints. Can the Government also consider ratifying and adopting the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 190 and to oblige employers to create environments that are free from harassment, and for employers to institute formal policies and structures to deal with harassment?The Chairman: Senior Parliamentary Secretary Low Yen Ling.The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling): Mr Chairman, Minister Josephine Teo and Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad have spoken much on the fair opportunities. Earlier on, Members have been given a brochure. I think it is good to highlight the brochure again. Whatever was covered in the earlier speeches have been very well encapsulated in this very colourful brochure – from providing fair opportunities to ensuring fair hiring, to ensuring fair competition and providing fair support.I also want to add on and say that MOM is also striving to improve work opportunities and progress for our women – many Members have advocated very passionately about that – as well as for care-givers, and also enhance the hiring process of foreign domestic workers (FDWs).Women in Singapore have made remarkable progress in terms of education, employment and earnings. Our female resident employment rate for those aged 25 to 64 has improved significantly over the past decade, rising from 64% in 2009 to 73% in 2019. More than half of females aged 25 to 64 now have at least tertiary-level education, rising from 37% in 2009 to 55% in 2019.With improvements in employment rate and education profile, the share of women has risen across broad occupational groups. More women are in PMET jobs, rising from 49% to 57% of women over the decade. Their earnings have also increased, as median income of full-time employed females rose from about $2,800 in 2009 to $4,300 in 2019.We will build on the progress achieved to make our workplaces fairer and even more progressive for women. Many women juggle multiple roles, like many hon Members have said earlier. Many women juggle multiple roles at work and also at home, juggling our work, our family aspirations and also our personal aspirations. As women tend to be primary care-givers for families, some may stop work to better care for their families, for their ageing parents, parents-in-law, even aunties and uncles, or for their young children or children with special needs.Prof Lim Sun Sun spoke very passionately and asked about the support for mothers to transition back to work. In this respect, the Government helps in many ways, from matching mothers with options to full-time work with flexible work arrangements (FWAs) or part-time work, to providing greater access to childcare support, and promoting FWAs.We recognise that women who have left the workforce for longer periods of time may need additional help, additional support, to find jobs, including part-time work. The Adapt and Grow (A&G) initiative offers employment facilitation services and also re-skilling as well as professional conversion programmes to help jobseekers enter and transit into new jobs.One of these programmes is Career Trial, which provides opportunities for jobseekers and also employers to try each other out over a period of time and assess the job fit – the suitability to the job and also the suitability of the employer to the job, and also whether can the employee work with the people in the organisation and the employer.During the trial, which can be up to three months, jobseekers receive a training allowance from the Government. Last year, in May 2019, Career Trial was expanded to include part-time jobs to cater for those who prefer part-time work. There are currently over 500 part-time vacancies available for our Career Trial. We encourage care-givers to step forward if they are keen to try out part-time positions while balancing their family or balancing their care-giving responsibilities. Back-to-work women who need career assistance can visit WSG's Careers Connect and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute's, in short, NTUC-e2i's, career centres.In addition, as Minister Josephine Teo highlighted last week, during the Prime Minister's Office Committee of Supply (PMOCOS), mothers can now enroll their children in affordable and also good quality preschools more easily.We share Ms Yip Pin Xiu's view that childcare is a shared responsibility between the mum and the dad – between both parents. The recent increase in shared parental leave supports this, and we hope that the move towards more FWAs will enable fathers as well as mothers to share care-giving responsibilities.Mr Deputy Chairman, as our population greys and as the world of work evolves, we have made continual progress to improve our employees’ access to FWAs – not just for women but for all workers. Men can benefit. Older workers can benefit as they would want to adjust their intensity when they reach a certain age when the grandchildren come along. So, all workers – men and women, young and old – can benefit from FWA, like what Mr Patrick Tay and also Ms Jessica Tan rightly mentioned.5.15 pmIn July last year, the Government more than tripled the Work-Life Grant budget from $30 million to $100 million to encourage more companies to provide FWAs. So far, the Work-Life Grant’s take-up rate has been promising. Since its enhancement as of 1 July 2018, over 1,120 companies have come on board Work-Life Grant as at end December 2019. And four in five of this company are SMEs. That means 80% of the Work-Life Grant recipients are SMEs. I think this is a really good sign. We encourage more companies, especially our SMEs, or even micro-enterprises to step forward and benefit from this Work-life Grant to put in place FWAs in their workplace.More importantly, companies that have put in place FWAs have been better positioned to implement flexible work arrangement very quickly, especially in a time of crisis. Like many Members have said earlier, when COVID-19 emerged in January, companies that have already adopted FWAs earlier, already had or could quickly put in place measures, whether it is flexi-time, flexi-place, flexi-load, telecommuting, staggered hours or shared job functions. They could quickly put that in place and this allowed them to minimise disruptions to their business as well as to minimise the team's exposure to the virus.So, I want to assure Miss Cheng Li Hui and also Assoc Prof Daniel Goh and Mr Douglas Foo that more companies are now realising the value and also expediency that FWAs can bring to their employees and also the operations. FWA can be win-win for the companies and also the employees.For example, this company Kone Private Limited which is a lift and escalator maintenance company. They have a \"Flexi-place\" arrangement which allows their employees to telecommute and the company could continue their business operations without affecting the productivity. Even prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, its Senior Sales Engineer, Ms Jasmine Tan, she is a mother of two young children, she was already enjoying the ease of juggling her work and her family needs through telecommuting, and this has improved her work productivity, as well as job satisfaction.Earlier on, Members talked about the importance of telecommuting. It is, indeed, catching on. In 2018, one in four employees required formal or ad hoc telecommuting, of which seven in 10 had access to it. I want to assure Prof Lim Sun Sun that MOM will continue to monitor such data. This data is important to us. We will continue to monitor it as FWAs have proven to be useful for both employers and employees, especially in business continuity planning when threats like COVID-19 strike.Companies like Kone that I have mentioned earlier, which had FWAs in place before COVID-19, realised that they are much better placed to respond to the crisis and could safeguard their business functions and continuity. So, Mr Chairman, FWAs are not simply HR measures. In fact, when implemented well, FWAs have the power to enhance the companies’ agility, to enhance the companies' ability to meet changes and to address business need as well as to attract and retain talent.We hope that during this COVID-19 episode, more companies will adopt FWAs and recognise the advantages that such arrangements bring to their business and also their employees. As Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat pointed out, every effort to ride out this storm makes a difference because when we combine everyone’s effort, when we aggregate everyone's effort, we have a force that is amplified many times over. And we are certain that FWAs have already begun to make a positive impact in such a time as this, and the mindset and attitudes of employers towards FWA adoption will gain greater traction and also resonance.Employers are already recognising that FWAs are beneficial to their business. I think everyone would have read the two-page coverage in The Straits Times on Sunday. They tell us – employers tell us – that FWAs have the greatest positive impact on staff retention and recruitment. Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar will be pleased to know that more employers than before are offering FWAs. In 2018, more than nine in 10 of employees work in companies that provide some form of work flexibility. This is up from eight in 10, in Year 2013. Another important data – in Year 2018, more than eight in 10 employees who required FWAs had access to the FWA that they needed – and this is also an increase from seven in 10 in Year 2016.Together, with enlightened employers and employees, we are confident that we will emerge stronger from this COVID-19 episode.Singaporeans have given a resounding support to improving access and availability of FWAs. MOM is committed to do even more to promote adoption and access to FWAs. As Minister Josephine Teo had highlighted in her recentCOSspeech, the Citizens' Panel, as part of the SG Together movement, which was launched by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat gave strong support to strengthening worklife harmony (WLH) in Singapore, and recognised the important role that FWAs play in this respect.This Citizens' Panel, comprising 55 Singaporeans from all walks of life, recommended a greater push for FWAs. They had exchanged diverse views and weighed the trade-offs before putting together their comprehensive report. Once again, Minister Josephine Teo, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Faishal Ibrahim and I would like to say a big thank you to this Citizens' Panel. Fifty-five Singaporeans who came together over four full weekends from September all the way to November to deliberate about this important issue, Work-Life Harmony (WLH). The Government, NTUC and SNEF greatly appreciate their feedback and are in total agreement to intensify our efforts to spur the adoption of FWAs.How do we intend to do so? Firstly, we will \"Make It Easy\", make it easy for companies to offer FWAs and WLH initiatives. There are four parts to this \"Make It Easy\" pillar.The first one: some sectors have unique characteristics which will lead to challenges in adopting FWAs. For instance, we all know employees in hospitality and healthcare sectors are required to work shifts, and may not have access to FWAs or even access to staggered hours. We acknowledge these hurdles, and we will develop sector-specific resources to facilitate the implementation of FWAs.Ms Jessica Tan earlier had asked about how businesses may leverage new trends and transform their HR practices to encourage greater participation in the workforce. Indeed, there are companies and businesses that are at the forefront of such progressive practices and those that have moved ahead faster, for instance, in implementing FWAs, we encourage them to share their experiences with others. So, through the Institute for Human Resource Professionals (IHRP), we will pilot sector-specific employer support groups, called Communities of Practice, for FWAs. The HR professionals, the senior managers from companies that have made FWAs work well for them can share their best practices with the fellow professionals in the sector or even across different sectors. That is the second one.The third one – under \"Make It Easy\", we will make it easier for companies to access the myriad of resources on FWAs. We want to simplify things. So, we will revamp TAFEP’s website to be the one-stop resource for everything to do with FWAs, for instance, consolidating all implementation guides so as to make it easy for the companies to adopt.The fourth one – under \"Make It Easy\", to facilitate the implementation of FWAs, we will develop an online free-to-use employment contract builder to help the employers include clauses on FWAs in their employees’ contracts.Those four modes come under \"Make It Easy\".The second one, we will \"Make It Known\" by raising awareness of FWAs – not just FWAs but also WLH initiatives. Firstly, we will promote greater awareness of progressive practices through tools such as the national Human Capital Diagnostic Tool (HCDT). The HCDT helps companies to better understand their current HR processes better and identify areas for improvement. For instance, this could include appropriate job sizing that is necessary for WLH. So, they want to provide WLH, they do not quite know how to job size it so this actually could help them have a better sense on curating the job sizing. So, HCDT will be offered free to companies which have demonstrated firm commitment to improving WLH.Next, we will also raise awareness on FWAs and the benefits of WLH initiatives. To this end, TAFEP has started to grow a community of Work-Life Ambassadors to spread the word within and beyond the workplace. We are grateful to the Labour Members of Parliament and also to Secretary-General in NTUC and we know they will continue to support union workers as they actively advocate and promote WLH, and also appreciation to SNEF for encouraging employers to appoint champions for WLH.In addition to that, we will expand our recognition of employers who are committed to WLH. For example, employers who have just started on their FWA journey, it can be quite daunting because they do not quite know where to start. Those of them who have not yet fully adopted the Tripartite Standard on FWAs, for this group of employers we want to \"Make It Easy\" for them and \"Make It Known\" so we will introduce a basic FWA workshop. This workshop will teach our employers how to start offering FWAs. In fact, this will then help place them on a new Provisional Tripartite Standard on FWAs and that will recognise their efforts in taking the first step. The first step is always the most important. And companies that are more progressive can adopt the new Tripartite Standard on Work-Life Harmony, which goes beyond FWAs and touches on additional programmes that improves employees’ WLH.We have now three types: one is the Provisional Tripartite Standard on FWA and the current existing Tripartite Standard on FWA and for the more progressive, we have the Tripartite Standard on Work-Life Harmony. So, a stepped approach for companies of varying preparedness.Now, within the report are other suggestions considered by the Panel, such as the right-to-request for reduced hours. FWA legislation was also an aspect that was brought up by Ms Anthea Ong and Mr Chen Show Mao. Though made with good intention, such legislation may lead to unintended consequences.For example, it could lead to unintended impact of making it unattractive for employers to consider employing those who are likely to exercise the right, such as jobseekers who are care-givers, parents or seniors. These are told to us by the Citizens' Panel that they would prefer that we have a broad-based adoption of FWAs instead of legislation because they know that legislation is not the silver bullet to solve this issue. And that is why a more practical approach is to provide the employers' support and the flexibility of various types of FWAs which they can choose from that best suit theirs as well as their employees’ needs.To sum up, Mr Chairman, we are already working to implement, over the next 12 months, the recommendations which I had just highlighted. \"Make It Easy\"; \"Make It Known\". And the \"Make It Easy\"; \"Make It Known\" complement the \"Make It Accepted\" move that was announced by Minister Josephine Teo last week during the PMOCOS. Now, with this, we are confident that this collective move for FWAs by the Citizens’ Panel and our tripartite partners will help to make FWAs the norm and also make positive shifts in our workplace culture, like what Ms Jessica Tan has described and with that, to further improve the WLH in Singapore.[Mr Speaker in the Chair]Mr Chen Show Mao had enquired about paid eldercare leave and Mr Louis Ng asked about legislating parent care leave. I want to assure both Members that the needs of working Singaporeans who are also care-givers are utmost on our minds. In 2018, Senior Minister of State for MOH Edwin Tong led an across-agency review, which I am also part of, to better understand the care-givers' need.Compared to family care leave, the working care-givers interviewed, they similarly had the same conclusion as the Citizens' Panel. They felt that FWAs are a more sustainable, a more preferred means to meet their care-giving needs. Why? Because they told us they preferred to have the flexibility and the ability to take some time off when their parents need to go to hospital for appointment or their special needs kids need to go for EIPIC intervention and so on. They would rather have the flexibility and ability to take some time off when the need arises, rather than have a few more days of leave. Mr Chairman, please allow me to say a few words in Mandarin.5.30 pm(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]To overcome the challenges posed by an ageing population and job changes, MOM has been promoting flexible work arrangements or FWAs over the years. This will allow more employees to look after their families while working and achieve work-life harmony , which can improve employee loyalty and productivity.We will adopt the two-pronged approach that I mentioned previously, which is to \"make it easy\" and \"make it known\", so that our businesses can implement FWAs in a sustainable and efficient manner.First, we have to ensure ease of adoption to enable businesses to adopt FWAs easily. As each industry has different human resource needs, we will recommend feasible sector-specific FWA implementation guides.Second, we must do more to promote FWAs, to create greater awareness of the benefits of FWAs amongst businesses and employers. Some businesses have committed to implement FWAs but are unsure about how to implement these arrangements. We would like to introduce a Human Capital Diagnostic Tool to help companies make better judgments and decisions.NTUC and the Singapore National Employers' Federation will also appoint union leaders and employer representatives as work-life champions to raise awareness among Singaporeans about the importance of FWAs in terms of career development and business sustainability.Following the COVID-19 outbreak, many enterprises now agree that this kind of flexible arrangement is beneficial and is a win-win solution for both employers and employees. Through the strategies of \"make it easy\", \"make it known\", we want to enable businesses to adopt FWA easily and effectively, so that more employers will come on board to retain their employees and co-create a sustainable future.(In English): Mr Chairman, as MOM continually strives to improve working conditions for Singapore workers, we need to make it a point to enhance processes to address workplace harassment. We agree with Ms Yip Pin Xiu that employers play an important role in managing workplace harassment. We want to assure her and the House that, firstly, TAFEP guides our employers to put in place proper grievance handling process through resources like the tripartite advisory on managing workplace harassment. Secondly, when TAFEP receives a complaint of an employer's improper handling of a case, TAFEP engages the employer to educate them and to ensure that they implement the advisory's measures. So far, all employers that TAFEP has engaged with have been cooperative and receptive. Thirdly, if the employers fail to provide a safe environment for their employees, or they refuse to heed TAFEP's advice, we will take action against them, including curtailing their work passes.Last, not but least, Mr Chairman, allow me to briefly touch on how MOM is improving the employment of FDWs in Singapore.MOM had announced a series of measures in October last year to enable better matches between our employers and FDWs. We are rolling out these measures progressively over the next two years to allow all parties to adjust to the changes.It is in the interest of both parties to have a lasting employment relationship – employers want minimal disruption to their households and FDWs want a stable income to support their families back home.During second quarter of this year, MOM will launch an enhanced online Employment Agency (EA) directory to boost the employers' FDW search and give the employers greater clarity in their selection of EAs for their hiring needs. Besides showing the EAs' FDW retention rates, this directory will also feature several other enhancements.Firstly, it will allow prospective employers to view customer ratings of an EA's services. For instance, find out the EA's ability to match a suitable FDW and if past clients would recommend the EA.Secondly, the directory will show the EAs' policies on FDW replacement and the refund of placement loans. This is important because this will enable prospective employers to more easily compare service offerings from the different EAs and identify one that fits their hiring needs.Third, the improved directory will enable EAs to showcase their niche services, such as providing FDWs trained in care-giving skills, or FDWs who can be swiftly deployed under the Advance Placement Scheme (APS).So, Mr Chairman, with greater transparency of information, prospective employers can now make better informed decisions, as well as differentiate the EAs based on their policies and also their performance and track record; and thereby, improving the chance of a more suitable FDW match.We are strongly encouraging the employers to use the online EA directory to assess and search for a suitable EA before engaging one to hire an FDW. These enhancements are a result of close consultations with employers through focused group discussions and also the EAs, as MOM seeks to improve the search experience for employers, while enabling the EAs to profile themselves fairly. MOM will be providing a briefing to EAs on the new features of this enhanced directory to help them adjust to the changes.However, we know that getting a good match at the hiring stage is not enough. To build and maintain a healthy and strong working relationship between employers and FDWs, the employers and FDWs have to be understanding to each other. And they have also to be fair in their everyday interactions with each other.To help the first-time FDWs and employers adjust to their new roles, MOM require them to attend the FDW Settling-in Programme (SIP) and the Employers' Orientation Programme (EOP) respectively. At the SIP, we encourage the FDWs to maintain open communication with the employers and to perform their work duties responsibly. At the EOP, we inform the employers of their legal obligations, to help them understand their FDWs' culture differences and also encourage the employers to look out for the needs of their helpers especially in the initial period of employment.MOM also works with the Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) to interview first-time FDWs in their first few months of employment. The interview is important, because the interview helps detect any settling in issues so that the FDWs and the employers can work together to resolve them early. In this year, in 2020, CDE will be stepping up their interviews to cover more first-time FDWs.In addition to these initiatives, MOM continually work with different stakeholders to support both FDWs and employers. Such efforts include providing meaningful social infrastructure for our FDWs during their rest day. And I am very glad to know that FAST, which stands for Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training, will be launching a new multi-service hub later this year that has a bigger capacity to offer more value-added training and also space to offer recreational activities for FDWs on their rest day.Chairman, much has been done to support our Singapore workforce – from FWAs to safeguarding the employees from unfair treatment. We have also made efforts to developing lasting work relationships between employers and FDWs by enhancing the hiring process.However, there is still more that we can do. Despite the challenges we face today, I believe that our continued efforts will enable us to emerge even stronger. Through the joint efforts of Singaporeans – from employers to employees, from businesses to Government and the tripartite partners and also supporting organisations, everyone plays a part. As long as we are determined to transform, collaborate and work together, we can enhance our workplace and shape a better future together.The Chairman: Clarifications. Mr Patrick Tay.Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan: Mr Chairman, I filed two cuts earlier, one asking for a review of Trade Unions Act and the other on the review of Industrial Relations Act and I hope to get a response from the Minister.Mrs Josephine Teo: Mr Chairman, we regularly review the Industrial Relations Act as well as the Trade Unions Act. Probably later this year, we will pool together a tripartite workgroup to look at an update to the Industrial Relations Act. And during that time, we will take into consideration the suggestions that the Member has made.As to the Trade Unions Act, I think, in specific, the Member had asked about representation for self-employed persons, membership and representation for self-employed persons. Today, there are already associations that represent them. I think if we engage these associations and hear them out, we could probably find a way forward that they would also be comfortable with.The Chairman: Mr Zainal Sapari.Mr Zainal Sapari: My clarification is with Minister of State. I made a cut on the electronic salary payment for work permit holders. Could the Minister of State on the proportion of work permit holders who are already paid electronically and whether MOM will consider making electronic payment of salary for work permit holders mandatory?Mr Zaqy Mohamad: Mr Chairman, our laws today already require employers and work permit holders to provide electronic salary payment if the workers request for it.Today, we know we work together with MWC to educate workers as well as share with them their rights so that they can also go to the employers and request for this. In fact, a foreign worker survey conducted by MOM in 2018, indicated that 76% of foreign workers are paid electronically, higher than the 67% in 2014. So, what is different? Over the last few years, we have been working actively to facilitate the set-up of bank accounts amongst new foreign workers. And since October last year, we have also been doing it for those doing renewals. At the same time, MWC has been conducting Settling-in Programmes (SIPs) and therefore, during these programmes, it will help workers who wish to be paid electronically.At the same time as well, we also know through talking to stakeholders that there are micro SMEs that have expressed concerns, the mom-and-pop shops, for example, who have difficulties in the short term. But I think, the numbers will go up in the long term, so let us study this and see how best we can bridge the gap.The Chairman: Ms Anthea Ong.Ms Anthea Ong: Chairman, I thank Minister of State Mr Zaqy for sharing the good news on workplace mental health today. I think my mental health definitely got better after his speech.Given that there is still stigma that exists in the workplace on mental health, I think it is really quite difficult for persons with mental health conditions to ask for FWAs. I appreciate Senior Parliamentary Secretary Ms Low Yen Ling saying that it is not going to be working in our favour to legislate the right to FWAs but can I ask if the Citizens' Panel who recommended that had any persons with mental health conditions in the Panel? And, if not, would the Ministry and the Senior Parliamentary Secretary Ms Low Yen Ling consider the specific needs of persons with mental health conditions as we embark on all the wonderful efforts on FWAs, going forward?Ms Low Yen Ling: I want to thank the Member, Ms Anthea Ong. As she started off, I thought the clarification was directed at Minister of State. And then, I think it got boomerang back. But I want to thank her for her passion in this area. Earlier on, I did not have the time but allow me to share this.Two years ago, I was involved in Senior Minister of State Mr Edwin Tong's cross agency committee for care-givers. And that Motion was tabled in February 2019. Last year, in September, Minister Josephine Teo sponsored the Citizens' Panel on worklife harmony. Interestingly, both committees came to the same conclusion on their own.For the care-giving committee, they interviewed many care-givers, not just care-givers with aged parents but also care-givers with younger children. They also came up with the original wishlist of legislating the right to request for FWA, legislating more leave and so on. For example, the Citizens' Panel, came to their conclusion that legislation cannot be a silver bullet for every issue. And they recognised that, whether it is FWAs or worklife harmony, everyone has a role to play. And, with that, they shared with us that it is important, in order to achieve broad-based adoption of FWA and then, eventually, worklife harmony, including for persons with mental wellness issues, the important thing is to encourage adoption of FWAs and also greater awareness.5.45 pmWe took their recommendations very seriously. That is why in the past few months, we have been working with them to see how we can distill into very tangible items under \"Make It Easy\", \"Make It Known\" and \"Make It Accepted\". For example, one of the interesting things they discussed during their sessions was the right to request for FWA that has been introduced in some countries such as the UK, New Zealand, Canada, Australia. But we have found that in these countries, such legislation, although passed, merely gives the employees the right to ask for FWA. Interestingly, there have been anecdotal evidence saying that the employers can still reject the FWA applications based on a wide range of reasons that seem very reasonable and valid. For example, UK employers have rejected FWA applications on the grounds of additionalcosts or how it could affect the quality of work.The Citizens Panel is rightly concerned that if we look at legislation as a way to address this issue, it may lead to the unintended impact of eroding the employability for the very people we are trying to protect and whom we are trying to make sure will benefit from FWA.The Chairman: Mr Louis Ng.Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: Thank you, Sir. Two clarifications. A lot of the response to my suggestions so far has been that we will focus on FWA instead. But I think we need to acknowledge that FWA is not going to accessible to everyone, as the Senior Parliamentary Secretary has acknowledged just now, especially to our frontline officers who we have been paying tribute to over the last few weeks. It will be very hard for nurses, doctors, teachers, pre-school teachers, cleaners, security – the list goes on – to have access to FWA. And that is why I say it is not a zero sum game. Can MOM consider focusing on FWA but at the same time, also legislating the parent care leave, childcare sick leave, so that we get the best of both worlds? We are doing this for the civil service already. Why not for the others?Secondly, I actually had a cut on annual leave. I do not think it was responded to. But I have a stronger focus on that because I think the workers who get the seven days of annual leave, which is the minimum number, are likely to be our lowest income workers. And they are also the workers who probably need the most rest. They are also the workers who probably do not have access to FWA, parent care leave, childcare sick leave. So, can we at least legislate and give a higher minimum number of annual leave so that these lower income workers will be able to benefit?Mrs Josephine Teo: Mr Chairman. I appreciate Mr Louis Ng's passion in advocating for more leave provisions. In an ideal world, I would like to be able to say yes to all of them. But we do not live in an ideal world. And I am very much reminded by our former Minister for Labour Mr S Rajaratnam when he moved the Employment Act in 1968. He reminded us of why we are here and why we are seeking to improve work conditions through the Employment Act. He was responding to many Members' calls for employer obligations in many different areas – more protection in this area, more protection in another area. And he said something really profound and I think it remains valid today.He reminded Members of the House that in order for us to be able to protect employees, we must first have employment. In other words, the jobs must be available. If there is no employment, there is no employment protection to speak of.So, for every of the moves that MOM tries to make, it is always in consultation, not only with the Labour Movement whom we can completely count on to speak up on behalf of workers and to try and advocate for their interests, but at the same time, we must also involve the employers in this conversation and hear them out and understand the pressures that they face, and then, make a judgement call. At different times, what kinds of pressures we are prepared to exert in order to get the best outcomes for Singaporeans. It is always a balancing act. And MOM is always in the middle. So, we are the true sandwiched class, in some sense.But let us keep all these things in mind. I see no reason why we cannot continue to review our policies. And I believe that at the right time, when conditions allow, we would certainly want to improve the employment conditions for all of our workers.Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast): I cannot help but chip into the discussion on FWA even though I did not speak, if I may. I think this is something that we have, in the PAP Women's Wing, been championing. We have always talked from the legislation and how everybody wants it. Actually, a lot of research has already been established to say this is good for business. Businesses who do it have lower turnover, higher performance, morale is good, higher job satisfaction – all the good things.Perhaps one approach if MOM can take a lead is to evangelise the benefits of FWA with employers, so that it is something that they will embrace by being a great place to work, so they can attract the best talent. I think perhaps that is something that we all have agreement, but where do we start? And I think it is proven that it is good for business. So, if we can look at that, that would be great.Ms Low Yen Ling: Mr Chairman, I want to thank Member Ms Foo Mee Har and also the Women's Wing Members of Parliament for advocating for this FWA issue very passionately over the course of a few years. She is right. It is important that we continue to evangelise, a word the Member used.Minister Josephine Teo, Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad and myself have for the past two years been doing that with the trade associations and chambers, including SBF and SNEF. One important thing we learnt – and I think this is what Ms Foo Mee Har is alluding to and links to the first move that I mentioned – coming up with and developing sector-specific resources. In the past, we had a very generic Tripartite Advisory. We realised that for some sectors, they have certain constraints, especially with work shifts and so on. I highlighted hospitality and healthcare. Another one is food services. We are prepared. Moving forward, we will develop sector-specific resources. What type of resources? It could come in the form of a guide. And that will come about because we have a discussion with the sector and also with some companies in the sector that are more progressive and have been put in place FWA. We will then crystalise that into a guide or even video, which then makes it easier for them to share within a company and with other companies.The short answer is yes, we will do that.The Chairman: Assoc Prof Walter Theseira.Assoc Prof Walter Theseira: Thank you, Chairman. Earlier, I filed the cut on the existing Special Employment Credit (SEC). I would just like to clarify with the Minister – where older PMETs are concerned, how effective has the existing SEC been at job retention versus facilitating hiring. I am asking because retention may well be easier than hiring retrenched PMETs so how will the Ministry approach these challenges separately with the redesign of the SEC and the renewed emphasis on supporting senior employment.Mrs Josephine Teo: Mr Chairman, a number of schemes work in concert with each other to support senior employment. Truth be said, we do not depend solely on the Special Employment Credit and what is to replace, the Senior Employment Credit.When it comes to retention of older workers, and older PMETs, in particular, the strongest feedback that we get from employers is that of skills obsolescence. In fact, when we convened the tripartite workgroup on older workers, which led to the recommendation to raise the Retirement Age and the Re-employment Age, the strongest comment on the part of the employer is that they are willing to support it, as long as we have ways and means to ensure that their workers' skills remain relevant. They feedback to us that there have been occasions where they would like their senior workers to go for training and to be ready to be re-deployed into different positions when they come to re-employment, so that the positions that they occupied could be freed up to also younger colleagues to move up.They face a fair amount of resistance. Sometimes, it is just a lack of motivation to take up training. Sometimes, from the workers' standpoint, he thinks, \"Well, if I am not going to be in work for very much longer, why ask me to go for training?\" Hence, we were able to persuade the employers that if they gave the workers the assurance, even PMETs, that they have a longer runway, then perhaps this could motivate them.But this alone is not enough. We are very grateful that to the Labour Movement for being very involved. The Company Training Committees can really exert an influence on the ground. Training is very seldom a solo effort. Peer support – everyone going to train at the same time, everyone in their 50s, 60s and learning data analytics, everyone trying digitalisation tools. It makes a difference. This kind of ground mobilisation is critical. We cannot depend on laws alone, we cannot depend on guidelines alone. Ground mobilisation makes a huge difference.Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: I promise the Minister this is the last time I will talk about leaves – this week. Just one last clarification. Can I just ask whether MOM has studied or will be studying whether increasing someone's annual leave entitlement will reduce employability?Mrs Josephine Teo: Mr Chairman, I cannot, in all honesty, cite a study that will link one particular policy move to employability. A whole host of factors come into play. An ill-timed move could precipitate changes that are unfavourable. A well-timed move of the same change may not have that impact.Having said that, let me reassure Mr Ng, whether it is this week or next week, it will always be on MOM's mind to think of ways in which we can improve work conditions as well as worklife harmony.The Chairman: Mr Patrick Tay, would you like to withdraw your amendment?Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan: I would like to thank my fellow Members of Parliament in this House for preparing and filing cuts for this MOMCOS. I would like to thank Minister, Sister Josephine Teo; Minister of State, Brother Zaqy Mohamad and Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Sister Low Yen Ling; as well as the team in MOM, Brother Aubeck Kam, Permanent Secretary; Brother Tan Choon Shian, CE of WSG; Brother Augustin Lee, CE of CPF, for powering the whole MOMCOS. I am sure all the measures that Minister and the team have announced to be more fair, be it in terms of fair support, fair hiring, fair opportunities as well as fair competition, will help us – workers, employers and the various tripartite partners – in all the respective sectors, to stay ready, relevant and resilient to the short-term disruptions; and able, agile and adaptable to the long-term challenges. On that note, I would like to beg leave to withdraw my amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $2,433,064,700 for Head S ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $50,791,200 for Head S ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates."

        "Content": "The Chairman: Head R, Ministry of Law. Mr Christopher de Souza, you can take all your four cuts together.6.00 pmTop Legal Services HubMr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah): Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head R of the estimates be reduced by $100.\"MinLaw plays an important role in developing Singapore as a hub for international legal services. In 2018, the Singapore International Arbitration Center (SIAC) emerged as the third most preferred arbitral institution in the world and the most preferred arbitral institution based in Asia. While SIAC draws a strong demand for arbitration from parties in Asia, there are trends and developments that indicate that the demand for arbitration in Singapore will move beyond Asia.For instance, in 2018, the United States topped the foreign user rankings for the first time. Last year, the field of arbitration in Singapore was given a further boost to widen its global influence through the opening of Maxwell Chambers Suites with a whole suite of arbitration offices and facilities. Dignitaries from 12 countries and more than 350 guests from various facets of the legal industry attended the official opening.It houses the local offices of top international dispute resolution institutions such as the International Chamber of Commerce's, International Court of Arbitration (ICC) as well as the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA). Allow me, Sir, at this point to declare for the purposes of thisCOSdebate, this cut and all cuts after this, that I am a lawyer whose practice covers arbitration, litigation, advisory work and intellectual property.Moving back to the cut, Maxwell\tChambers Suites\tcurrently\thas\tthe\thighest concentration of case management offices in the world. It\talso houses\tINSOL\tInternational Asia Hub.\tINSOL is the International\tis the\tInternational Association for restructuring, insolvency and bankruptcy professionals. The INSOL International Asia Hub in Maxwell Chambers Suite is INSOL International's first ever physical expansion since the establishment of its London headquarters in 1982.Would the Minister share with us how the Ministry plans to help Singapore as a legal services hub, drawing to Singapore\tthe\tdemand\tfor\tinternational\tlegal\tservices across key practice areas?Civil, Community and Family JusticeMy next cut, Sir, is on civil, community and family justice. In a country where the rule of law is a bedrock of society, maintaining the people's trust in the justice system and increasing access to justice are key.To further these objectives, our civil, community and family justice systems have gone through several refinements. Launched in 2017, the State Court's Community Justice and Tribunals System (CJTS) is an electronic case filing and management system which helps promote access to justice by allowing parts of the legal system to be accessed by lay persons online. Through it, claims at the Small Claims Tribunal may be filed and negotiated, reducing the need to appear in court where an e-settlement is reached. Without needing to go to court, neighbours can also try to resolve disputes with the help of a court mediator through e-mediation.We also passed the Protection from Harassment Act so that victims obtain protection from harassment more easily. Will the Minister elaborate on what has been and will be done to further enhance our civil, community and family justice systems?Enhancing Our Criminal Justice SystemMy next cut, Mr Chairman, is on enhancing our criminal justice system. The criminal justice system is critical in maintaining law and order in Singapore. More than just a tool for ensuring that law be abided by and that there be order in Singapore, the criminal justice system is important for justice to be carried out, meted out in Singapore. The state has the proper mandate to mete out penal justice, punishing those who do wrong; otherwise, there may be increased vigilantism, mob justice and a descent into chaos and disorder.The corollary of that mandate is preventing the injustice of punishing persons for wrongs they did not commit; otherwise, law may be seen as arbitrary.It is therefore important that trust in our criminal justice system is maintained. Will the Minister therefore explain what has been done to ensure the continued efficacy of our criminal justice system here in Singapore?Singapore–A Formidable Fortress for Intellectual PropertyMy fourth cut, although is not my last cut for theCOS, is on a formidable fortress for Intellectual Property (IP), being Singapore. The Industrial Revolution 4.0 and the Digital, or Information Age rely heavily on intangible property rights, that is, intellectual property rights – to protect the way systems are designed, codes are written, products are created. Intellectual property rights or IP rights allow innovation to be sold, bought, traded and incentivises research and development of technology. IP rights also allow businesses to protect their reputation and reap from investments made in the quality of their products and services.Would the Minister elaborate on how the intellectual property regime will be used as a means to help our companies remain competitive in a challenging global environment? And, importantly, how will Singapore further fortify its position as a country and jurisdiction in which IP rights can be well protected and enforced?Question again proposed.Intellectual PropertyMs Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast): Mr Chairman, in a fast changing and competitive global landscape, we do appreciate that one of a company's competitive advantages is its brand, ideas and innovations. Singapore has come a long way in developing our Intellectual property (IP) capability and eco-system. Singapore is ranked second in the world and the highest in Asia for having the best IP protection as stated in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2019. In fact, this is one of the reason why Singapore is selected by many MNCs to invest their business and research development in Singapore.6.15 pmThe Intellectual Property Office of Singapore or IPOS has been pushing the boundaries to support businesses in using IP to grow. With IPOS’ strong reputation, credentials and capabilities in IP strategy protection and management, could the Ministry share how IPOS is helping Singapore companies especially small and medium enterprises understand the value of their IP, protect their IP and innovations as well as leverage their IP for competitive advantage?I welcome the Government’s move towards enhancing Singapore’s standing in becoming an even more established intellectual property hub and the launch of IPOS International last August. IPOS International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IPOS has over 100 IP experts in areas of IP strategy and management, patent search and analysis, and IP education and training. IPOS can provide customised programmes and this provides valuable assistance to many businesses. The use of technology by IPOS is also very encouraging.IPOS International’s suite of tools related to IP assets, for example, Illuminate for Enterprises, which is an online diagnostic tool developed by IPOS International, assists users to obtain a quick overview of their company’s IP, the health of their intangible assets, as well as any management gaps and risks. Are Singapore SMEs actively leveraging the suite of tools and engaging IPOS International to better understand and develop their IP strategy for competitive advantage? What is MinLaw’s assessment of the progress that Singapore companies are making in leveraging IP for their business growth and the commercialisation of IP of Singapore companies? My second cut.Enhancing Access to JusticeMr Chairman, could Minister also on what has been done to improve our criminal, civil, community and family justice systems to make access to justice for citizens simpler and more affordable? Could Minister also inform us on the key priorities on enhancing access to justice that we look forward to?I would like to highlight areas where some of my residents have sought assistance as they face challenges in their access to justice and equitable outcomes in one area of unscrupulous contractors.While the law does allow for legal recourse to be provided to consumers who have been cheated by contractors who do not perform their duties to the required standard, there are cases where  my residents have been let down or short-changed by contractors who have done shoddy works.Under the current legal framework, if my understanding is correct, an offence is committed only if money has been paid by the consumer and no work has been done at all. This may not be an altogether satisfactory, as the services rendered may be due to poor workmanship or left unfinished. If the contractor, despite given reasonable time does not rectify the works, what it leaves the consumer to do is to have to hire another contractor to rectify the works and then obtain legal redress which might take some time.In one of the cases that my resident sought sought my assistance, the said contractor has cheated others. When she had made Police reports, she was that the Police could not assist and that they had to pursue their own cases. The concern is that as they did this, whether besides recovering moneys, whether the contractor was continuing to cheat others and this somehow did not seem right.In another area of maintenance. While the provisions of the Women’s Charter provides for sanctions or in extreme cases, even imprisonment terms, to those who default in maintenance, by the time the law takes its course, it could provide cold comfort to the wives and children, many who live with relative financial strain. So, could the Ministry consider imposing measures of sufficient deterrence, so that defaulters who breach court orders in maintaining their families will think twice, such as imposing fines of appropriate severity, in addition to any existing penalties?I would also like to request the Ministry to share on what steps are being taken to educate and inform the public of their legal relief, especially in cases where Singaporeans do not have the financial wherewithal to afford legal representation and hence would be less cognisant of their legal rights.Legal Design for a Digitalised NationMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Sir, legal design is the application of human centred design to the world of law to make legal systems and services more human-centred, usable and satisfying. By its very nature, the law can be intimidating to navigate for the common man. To many, it can dense or verbose and inflexible and jargon lead. How many of us have blindly clicked on compliance boxes or lengthy forms when we download the latest version of whatever software we need or even signed PDPA forms without reading them?To that end, does the way companies and commercial entities and even the Government seek consent in today's digitalised world, ensure that our people are informed about their rights, the rights they are giving up or responsibilities and obligations they are signing up to. Sir, I believe there is room for better legal design in view of the digital tools available today. One Ministry whose website and mobile site has caught the eye for excellent legal design and user friendliness is that of MOM. Their mobile site is intuitive and captures all the critical information citizens will access in a simple and easy to read format. I was made to understand from a public officer at MOM that there is a team that analyses user behaviour with a view to improve online interaction and how to make online services easily understandable and easily understood.Chairman, Sir, the Budget book lists the key performance indicators of the Ministry some of which include a sound and progressive legal framework and access to justice for the low-income. While the tech-related outcomes in our march towards digitalisation may more appropriately come under GovTech or the Smart Nation office, legal design inputs can help many other Ministries and Statutory Boards improve the delivery and quality of services, and ultimately, outcomes for Singaporeans. I hope the Ministry plays a part with legal design tools to make the law more easily understandable and understood by the layman.The Chairman: Mr Patrick Tay, you can take your three cuts together.Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) JudgmentsMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast): Chair, my first cut is on the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) Judgments. With the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) having jurisdiction to adjudicate both salary-related disputes as well as wrongful dismissal claims, it now hears more cases.Having a deeper understanding of the rulings of the ECT would benefit not just practitioners and lawyers, but claimants and respondents too when presenting their respective cases. Past decisions of the ECT would be extremely useful as a source of reference and precedence and should thus be made available. For a start, I would like to suggest that the more landmark and instructive judgments can be selectively published.Enforcement of ECT Judgments/OrdersMy second cut is on Enforcement of ECT Judgments/Orders. The ECT now has jurisdiction to adjudicate both salary-related disputes as well as wrongful dismissal claims, making it more convenient for parties to resolve employment disputes via a single forum.However, an Employment Claims Tribunal judgment that is not satisfied would still need to be enforced in the same manner as an order made by a District Court. This would involve detailed processes set out in the Rules of Court pertaining to the filing of relevant forms/documents as well as the payment of court fees. A worker who has successfully obtained a judgment may thus still be subject to a protracted enforcement process. Workers’ lack of knowledge of the workings of our courts system exacerbates this problem.There is thus a need to simplify and expedite the enforcement mechanism to facilitate workers’ recovery of moneys. One suggestion in the context of an insolvent company, is for MOM to look at issuing cash advancements, which could be used to pay part of the worker’s unpaid wages, and thereafter to stand in place of the worker as a preferred creditor to recover the advanced moneys upon distribution of the insolvent company’s assets.Easier Access to Legal AidMy final cut is on easier access to legal aid. For Civil Court proceedings, even though registration for such legal aid can now be done online, a full means test with a means test officer is required if representation in court proceedings is required. Depending on the urgency of the case, it appears that it can take between seven days to a month to get an appointment and thereafter, another appointment for statement taking.I suggest giving applicants the option to do means testing as well as submit copies of required documents online in advance.For the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS), similar measures, such as allowing for registration and the means test to be done online, can also be implemented to speed up the application process for criminal legal aid cases.Further, a central online legal aid portal can be set up. Depending on whether legal aid is required for civil or criminal proceedings, potential applicants can then be directed to the relevant organisation’s website and resources. This would make it easier and less confusing. Similarly, can the means test to qualify for CLAS consider similar factors such as those used with the new means test administered by the Legal Aid Bureau?Encouraging Access to JusticeMs Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong): Legal aid schemes provide assistance to those who are unable to afford legal advice or representation. Legal aid, however, is only available to those who meet the criteria and some people may not be eligible. The claims may have merit but the legalcosts, may be prohibitive and so they decide not to pursue their cases. The concern becomes even more pertinent when it involves matters such as those relating to divorce, applications under the Mental Capacity Act or criminal matters.In this regard, what has been done to improve the legal aid schemes to enhance access to justice? Could the Ministry look at how to further assist individuals who are not eligible for legal aid to get the help they need?I declare that I am a lawyer in private practice.I raised previously the need to incentivise low bono efforts by lawyers. Many lawyers are already doing pro bono work but this often comes at acost to the lawyer’s earnings, and thus not sustainable. I had asked if a framework could be developed to support low bono efforts by lawyers to augment existing legal aid schemes. I note from the response last year, that MinLaw is working with partners like the Law Society Pro Bono Services and the Singapore Academy of Law to study how it could enhance support for pro bono and low bono efforts. Could MinLaw give an update on these efforts?Updating Probate and Apostille ProcessesMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok): Sir, I had raised the suggestion of simplifying procedures for non-contentious probate and administration matters in the pastCOSdebates. I still get feedback on cumbersome processes from people. One example is Mr Chan, whose wife recently died intestate suddenly. He is a care-giver of his autistic son aged 16. Based on the current rules under the Probate and Administration Act, there was a need for him to get another person to agree to be a co-administrator to administer his late wife's estate to protect his minor son's interests. This was not an easy task.In comparison, he was appointed as a single deputy by the Court to take care of his son and deal with his son's property and affairs under the Mental Capacity Act. I understand that the Government has been reviewing this matter since 2017. I seek an update. I will also be grateful if the Government could please consider the interplay between the various statutes in its review, too.Separately, I had pushed for Singapore to accede to the Hague Apostille Convention so as to rationalise the process involved in legalisation of documents for use here and in other countries. I would be grateful for an update on this matter.Singapore-Global Dispute ResolutionMr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir): Mr Chairman, I think mediation is a good dispute resolution mechanism for commercial disputes. I had once personally participated in a mediation under the auspices of the Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC) as my firm was involved in a commercial dispute that resulted in litigation.I was, at the time, quite impressed with the mediation format. It was less contentious and driven by parties instead of lawyers to seek a win-win solution where both parties are in a position to accept. It also makes sense from a commercial perspective. Mediation is more efficient than litigation in terms of time andcost. There is no need for commercial entities to be distracted from their day-to-day businesses by being embroiled in long drawn out andcostly litigation.Sir, I was therefore extremely pleased to note that, in August 2019, Singapore facilitated and was also among the first to sign the Singapore Convention on Mediation. This House has also passed the Singapore Convention on Mediation Bill earlier this month. We could be one of the first signatories to ratify the Convention.This will pave the way for cross-border enforcement of mediated settlement agreements, give businesses greater certainty and assurance and encourage the greater use of mediation to resolve international commercial disputes.I note that in the past three years, the SMC has conducted under its auspices, close to 1,500 mediations with a recorded settlement rate of between 65% and 69% each year. This means that almost seven in 10 commercial disputes referred to mediation are resolved amicably. This is an excellent rate of return. It is a reflection of the good work that the SMC puts in to resolve a majority of the disputes referred to them. If more litigated commercial disputes are referred to mediation, this could also potentially reduce the case load burden of the Singapore Courts.On the arbitration front, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, or SIAC, has also seen a steady rise of cases over the years. Based on information from its website, 80% of SIAC’s case load is international in nature and they have an experienced international panel of over 400 expert arbitrators from over 40 jurisdictions around the world.It, therefore, appears to me that Singapore is well-placed to capitalise on these developments and resources to position ourselves as a leading global dispute resolution hub. In the premises, Sir, I invite the Minister to share with this House the Ministry's larger strategic plans to promote Singapore as a leading global dispute resolution hub to resolve international cross-border commercial disputes.6.30 pmSupport for Law Firms and Legal SectorMs Rahayu Mahzam: In May 2019, MinLaw, together with the Law Society, Enterprise Singapore and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) launched Tech-Celerate for Law. This is a scheme for Singapore law practices to get funding support of up to 70% for the first-yearcost of adopting baseline and advanced technology solutions. This scheme is supposed to prepare law practices for future disruptions beyond baseline technology adoption, empower them to focus on delivering enhanced legal services, strengthen their capabilities and increase their competitiveness in the global landscape. This is, indeed, a meaningful endeavour. Law firms, like other businesses, need to equip themselves with the necessary technology to be efficient and productive and be ready for trends and changes in the future.However, as I had highlighted in my speeches in previous years, there is often hesitation on the part of small firms to invest time to review and adopt new technology because, unlike bigger firms, they cannot afford to dedicate resources and time to this effort in the midst of continuous and on-going legal work. I am also not sure if awareness of the various support programmes and schemes is high amongst the lawyers in the smaller firms. This may lead to some of these lawyers feeling left out of the efforts that MinLaw has been making in supporting the profession build capabilities. I am, therefore, wondering how MinLaw is preparing small law firms, which may not have sufficient resources, including time and money, to be future-ready?If awareness and interest in such technology adoption is not high, would MinLaw consider having more engagement and sharing sessions with smaller law firms to encourage the move towards adopting new technology?The Chairman: Mr Patrick Tay, you can do both your cuts.Embracing TechnologyMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast): Technology is increasingly being felt in the legal fraternity. AI and machine learning have already been tapped to review contracts and conduct research in other countries.I submit that existing stakeholders in the legal sector, such as practising lawyers and in-house legal counsel, will also need to be brought up to speed in this global move towards adopting legal technology solutions to improve productivity, accuracy as well as enhancing access to justice.It is inevitable that technology will continue to disrupt and change current work processes in law firms as well as the legal departments in the organisations. Funding of legal technology implementation and solutioning as well as training and upgrading subsidies should thus be set aside for continuing legal education in this area of legal tech solutions. I suggest that such funding should be extended to all relevant stakeholders in the legal sector, including in-house legal departments and counsel of private companies and organisations as well as the public agencies.Paralegal Upgrading and Community BuildingPara-professionals, commonly known as paralegals, are invaluable to the legal industry. They are employed by law firms as well as the legal departments in private companies and public agencies. Depending on the needs of the employer, a paralegal's role can range from conducting research and managing routine files to even knowledge management.Notwithstanding the wide scope of responsibilities undertaken by paralegals, their professional development as well as interests and welfare are often not given due priority, save for the Chief Justice's recent mention of the increasingly important role of allied legal professionals trained in skillsets relevant and complementary to the core responsibilities of a lawyer.I submit that more can be done to encourage employers of paralegals to set out clear career progression options for paralegals. These could include more diverse roles, such as project management, business development, legal innovation and legal technology, as well as understanding foreign legal jurisdictions to enable internationalism. To help paralegals take on such roles, a skills framework backed up by both the industry and regulators with nationally endorsed training providers must be promulgated and made available to all paralegals.Further, an association or union can be specifically set up to better engage paralegals, look after their interests as well as facilitate their professional training, development and progression. This must come with support from the industry and regulators.Community Use of State PropertiesMr Christopher de Souza: Sir, land is a valuable resource. Would the Minister elaborate on how we can optimise state properties to meet social and community needs? One excellent example is what was done to the former Henderson Secondary School. This state property has been transformed into an integrated space comprising a childcare centre, a nursing home and dialysis centre as well as an urban farm. How can we optimise state properties to meet social and community needs?The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong.The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai): Mr Chairman, I thank the Members for their speeches and for the queries that they have raised. I will address them.MinLaw's mission is, broadly, two-fold: first, to continually update our legal framework to meet both today's and tomorrow’s needs; second, to work together with our stakeholders to strengthen Singapore's position as a leading international legal services hub for Asia and, of course, the world.In the past two years, we had passed many pieces of legislation to achieve these objectives. We have redoubled our efforts at establishing Singapore as a legal services hub. This has included, as Mr Sitoh Yih Pin has said, the signing of the Singapore Convention on Mediation. I will touch more on that in a moment.Our focus for the coming year will be to implement the changes that we have put in the place, to ensure also that every Singaporean can be confident of effective access to justice in Singapore.Our legal system must be user-friendly, affordable and provide effective solutions. It must also be accessible to the most vulnerable amongst us.We will, therefore, continue to grow the legal services sector to ensure that more can enjoy the benefits of this growth whilst at the same time ensuring that those who require and need those services will have access to those services.Let me begin by speaking about my Ministry's efforts to strengthen the overall legal framework. Mr Christopher de Souza, Ms Jessica Tan and I think several others have touched on this.First, family justice. Those who use the family justice system are usually in a state of emotional turmoil, mental anguish and have seen their families break up. It is not a legal proceeding that they wish to be in. They are often also vulnerable, especially those families with children, whose interests, above all, must be looked after. That is the design focus of our laws – to look after the children in any matrimonial or family proceedings. This awareness has driven our revamp of the family justice system since 2014, as Members would be aware.Our aim is to reduce time,cost and, perhaps most importantly, unnecessary acrimony and to recognise and protect the interests of the children, so that the acrimony does not affect and adversely weigh on the outcomes for the children.We have moved significantly to improve the process. For example, in 2019, more than 55% of divorce cases were decided on the simplified track, which is faster, lesscostly and, obviously, less painful through the process, up from just 24% in 2015. These are encouraging numbers, but we do want to go further.The Government has, therefore, accepted the recommendations of the committee to Review and Enhance Reforms in the Family Justice System (RERF). The committee was tasked to look beyond just legal proceedings and, instead, focus on designing a robust eco-system of support for families. The committee made recommendations on mental capacity issues to address the needs of our ageing population as well. We are working with our stakeholders to implement these recommendations and put them into place.Ms Jessica Tan spoke about the enforcement of maintenance orders. This is an important concern and we do not want someone to have to spend time running from pillar to post to try to recover something that the Court has already granted by way of an order. We have taken steps, however, over the years to address this issue.Where the spouse cannot find work, perhaps due to poor health or other reasons as a reason why the orders have not been fulfilled, we should recognise that support services rather than legal proceedings will provide more effective relief for the wife and the children concerned. Nevertheless, at the same time, our laws must also have the tools to deal with a spectrum of options, different situations, including imprisonment, if necessary, so that we can enforce and give teeth to orders that have been made in Court. This serves as a strong deterrent.But, overall, Members should be assured that where there are genuine financial difficulties, circumstances that the family faces, the Courts will more likely order mediation or financial counselling to find a solution rather than to just simply impose the hard law.The Government is also considering how to make the overall maintenance regime, both in terms of the orders made as well as the enforcement, simpler and more effective.Moving on to civil justice. Members will know that two committees – one convened by my Ministry, the other by the Judiciary – made broad-ranging recommendations to enhance the efficiency, affordability and overall effectiveness of our Court system. We have completed public consultation and further discussions with key stakeholders and will introduce legislation to implement some of these changes in due course.Mr Patrick Tay raised concerns with the enforcement of Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT) orders. We are studying recommendations to streamline and simplify the enforcement of judgments and orders and will announce more details in due course once we have completed that.Mr Patrick Tay also suggested that in the case of insolvent companies, or companies that either cannot or have been unable or refuse to pay the wages, that MOM could advance money to the worker and thereafter stand in his place as a preferred creditor. I understand that MOM has looked at this proposal before and Mr Patrick Tay will probably know that while doing so might well help that specific worker in the immediate short term, it may also inadvertently create a larger problem of a viable company defaulting or owing the salaries in knowledge that the workers could find an alternative avenue to obtain those payments using Government funds. Overall, this leads to a potentially bigger problem in the system for a longer time.That said, for workers with no other alternative to recover unpaid salaries, the Short-Term Relief Fund (STRF) and the Migrant Workers' Assistance Fund (MWAF) can be tapped on. These provide ex-gratia payments to low-wage employees whose employers were unable to pay salaries due to financial difficulties or business failure.On the publication of certain ECT decisions, Mr Tay would know that, today, ECT judgments or grounds of decision are available to the public upon request. Why upon request? Because the original proceedings in the first place under the statute are held in private to protect the confidentiality of the parties. So, it follows that whatever takes place in those proceedings is not reported as of right. But the ECT will assess requests for either the judgments or the grounds of decision and, where appropriate, such as when it would help future cases or there is strong precedential value, then those would become available.I understand that MOM also makes applications to the ECT to publish judgments or grounds of decision that become useful reference points for parties in the same vein as I have outlined.Next, let me touch on criminal justice. On this, we have worked closely with MHA and other stakeholders in the past two years to make wide-ranging amendments to both procedural and substantive criminal law. Much legislation has been passed in this House on this aspect over the past two years.In particular, the Penal Code amendments have kept our legislation apace with emerging crime trends developing here and around the world and strengthened protection, in particular, for vulnerable victims. We have implemented most of these changes.This year, my Ministry is supporting the work of the newly-formed Criminal Procedure Rules Committee chaired by the Chief Justice. This committee will ensure that the Court procedure remains nimble and also adaptable to adjust and meet evolving needs.Mr Christopher de Souza and Ms Jessica Tan asked about supporting the efforts of Singapore enterprises to thrive in an innovation-driven economy. We have several initiatives. In the interest of time, let me just highlight a few.First, the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) have launched a new Intangible Disclosure Evaluation and Audit Scheme – a bit of a mouthful, so we have short-formed it to IDEAS. IDEAS provides a subsidy of up to $10,000 for companies to undergo an intangible asset evaluation and audit. This identifies intangible assets that are critical to the companies' businesses and recommends how to report them in a way that best communicates the business value of these intangible assets to their investors and the market, obviously, to try to realise the full value of such intangible assets. This helps companies when they raise financing.Second, IPOS' subsidiary, IPOS International, helps enterprises develop strategies to protect, manage and also commercialise the intangible assets and intellectual property (IP).To date, IPOS International has helped about 100 enterprises, with close to 95% of them being SMEs and start-ups. That is in answer to Ms Jessica Tan's question as to what help has been given to companies in Singapore. It has also developed a series of IP management business guides, which around 1,000 enterprises have accessed.Around 70 enterprises have used IPOS International's diagnostic tool, illuminate® for enterprise, to assess their IP and intangible assets risks and gaps, and perhaps they will be working on them and, eventually, can also take advantage of IDEAS.6.45 pmThird, we have expanded our patent acceleration initiatives last year to cover Artificial Intelligence (AI) patent applications. AI patent applications can now be granted as early as six months after filing. This supports the development of innovative AI technologies and helps companies with these technologies to remain competitive ahead of the curve. And as we know, technology sometimes outmoded very quickly. So, the quicker we can deal with the patent applications, the more value it is to the companies.Finally, the newly-launched IPOS Go mobile app enables businesses to register their trademark in just 10 minutes, down from the previous average of about 45 to 60 minutes. To date, over 150 businesses have used the IPOS Go app to protect their brands. These points would also be interest to Mr Singh who asked about we design processes and systems with the end-user in mind.Let me also turn now to address Ms Tan's and Ms Rahayu's points about access to justice.First, on civil legal aid. One change we have implemented is the increased flexibility to grant aid. Applicants who do not satisfy the means criteria but are otherwise unable to afford basic legal services without causing significant hardship to themselves and their families, these persons may have their applications reviewed by an independent Means Test Panel. Previously, the moment an applicant failed the means test, then the application was rejected. Now, we look at whether or not this person has failed it only because he had circumstances that might cause hardship to himself or to his family. The panel may waive the means criteria for these deserving applicants. The grant of aid will, of course, still be subject to the merits test, to ensure that applicants have good reasons to bring or defend their cases in law.Mr Tay asked about improving service delivery for legal aid. We will do so through a number of key initiatives.Let me just quickly outline them. First, we have just launched the revamped Applicant Portal for civil legal aid and new features will be included over the next few weeks. When completed, this portal will do away with the need to appear in person to complete the means testing and also the statement taking so that it can be done remotely without having to make a trip to the office.It reduces the need for applicants to provide information that the Government already has. So, for a start, we will tap on MyInfo to provide personal details and income information. These are the key criteria in assessing an application for legal aid. This will reduce processing time by at least two weeks, speeding up the process so that access to legal aid can be granted more quickly.It also, at the same time, is two-way, allows the applicants to check on the status of their application and be updated as to its progress.Second, the Legal Aid Bureau has just launched the first phase of its new chatbot, \"iLAB\". It will be able to provide basic legal information to LAB's potential applicants. It will also be able to triage them based on the nature of their case. And in most cases, this will save the applicants a trip to LAB to discuss it with the case officers in person.Finally, we are working to include a feature which will allow users to generate simple legal documents. Potential applicants can use these documents to self-help. They do not have to go to see lawyers. With iLab, these simple standardised documents commonly used can be generated. We hope to launch this in the next few weeks.Mr Singh spoke about design thinking. I think these are all features which fit towards that. And it is a good reminder by Mr Singh that we should be looking at the various enhancements to ensure that they are designed around our clients' needs. And I take the point that it ought not be dense or verbose, and we will endeavour to avoid that.Putting information online, enabling online applications, making it two-way, the process being dynamic, will make it easier for our clients who may find it difficult to be away from their families or take time away from work.We also undertook three rounds of rigorous user testing with LAB clients on the Portal and also on iLAB because we recognise that it can also be very frustrating if it does not work, the portal is not intuitive and not interactive enough. So, we have been fairly rigorous in the way which we have tested it before it goes out to market.The broader legal system also designs access to justice and legal awareness with the end-user in mind. For example, the Courts have pioneered an online dispute resolution system which litigants-in-persons can use to conduct negotiations and mediation for claims online for the Small Claims Tribunal. Mr Sitoh would be glad to hear that as well – you can now mediate your case online as well. And we are also exploring new features, such as asynchronous hearings to make it more convenient for Singaporeans to resolve their disputes. So, rather than to have parties at the same time at the same place, these facilities make it easier, facilitate claims before the Small Claims Tribunal and also allow for some mediation to take place.I shall elaborate more closely on the law firms' adoption of technology, a point raised by Ms Rahayu, later in my speech.Let me touch now on criminal legal aid.MinLaw has also been working with our partners on the Criminal Legal Assistance Steering Committee (CLA SC), including the Law Society as well as the Criminal Bar, to review the means criteria for the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS).We will adopt the new means criteria and limits for civil legal aid, what I have just outlined, for CLAS as well. These changes will simplify and therefore shorten the application process, while at the same time, maintain the rigour of the means test which we need to have, given that these are public funds that are being used. We will be working with the Law Society Pro Bono Services (LSPBS), which administers CLAS, to implement the changes in the coming year.Despite these changes, I wish to assure Members of this House that there will be no material impact on the number of households eligible for criminal legal aid.We will also continue to support the efforts of LSPBS to improve the administration of CLAS. This includes using technology to make the application process more efficient and user-friendly.At this juncture, let me acknowledge the strong support of members of the Bar, without whom the scheme would not have been quite so strong.Since 2015, the five largest law firms, Allen & Gledhill, Dentons Rodyk, Drew & Napier, Rajah & Tann and WongPartnership, have generously sponsored the CLAS Fellowship to enable lawyers to join LSPBS exclusively to handle criminal legal aid cases. Sixteen law firms have also signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) to pledge to take on CLAS cases. And I thank the lawyers, the legal fraternity for their support of this programme.Ms Rahayu asked about support for Singaporeans who cannot qualify for legal aid. To do so, we continue to forge strong partnerships with stakeholders to provide affordable legal help. So, even if you cannot qualify for these programmes, what else do we do?We work with the LSPBS, the legal fraternity and our community partners to provide legal help through Community Legal Clinics and various legal literacy and legal assistance programmes.The Government also works with the Law Society and the Law Schools to cultivate a strong pro bono culture within the legal profession. For example, law students are exposed pro bono work from an early stage. They have structured internships with Legal Aid Bureau (LAB) to inculcate not just the spirit but also to allow us to tap onto the law students to assist in our pro bono programmes.There have also been efforts by the wider legal eco-system. For example, the Singapore Academy of Law will be launching a collaborative workspace called \"CLICKS @ State Courts\", which will help firms adopt technology by providing them with shared amenities and facilities such as meeting rooms and office equipment. And by reducing operationalcosts, firms can then consider providing accessible and affordable legal services.But I think Ms Rahayu will agree with me when I say that access to justice goes beyond legal aid and just providing low bono or pro bono services. It is equally important that we see access to justice as understanding the problems in daily life, understanding at what stage there should be legal, and perhaps, also social intervention so that we can provide simple yet effective and, as far as possible, long lasting solutions to the problem at hand and not just fix the surface, leaving the underlying problems to continue to rear its ugly head.My Ministry has put in place various legal frameworks to deal with these issues.We have, over the last year or so, established a new Protection from Harassment Court. It will have specialised expertise and processes. Cases will be heard by specially trained judges. Volunteers will be on hand to assist victims, including from a social aspect and not just from a legal aspect. These changes are intended to minimise anxiety and stress, and to ensure that the victims of harassment can obtain effective remedies.Second, the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT). We continue to monitor its effectiveness as part of the broader framework that we have to resolve community disputes and also study areas for improvement of the processes.However, I would stress that mutually agreed solutions between two neighbours, for instance, should always remain the first port of call, that is, should always be the first base that one goes to instead of triggering a process in Court. The CDRT, as far as possible, should be a measure of last resort. So, we encourage Singaporeans to engage their neighbours in an amicable manner, when disputes arise – use community mediation services, use grassroots leaders who can facilitate the process.On community mediation, I should stress that the approach has been effective. In the past three years, more than 80% of the cases mediated before the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) has resulted in a successful resolution arising from the mediation.Third, the Government is also reviewing the processes and requirements for the application of probate and letters of administration. Mr Murali Pillai asked for an update on this.Amongst other things, we are considering digitalising the process, in sort of the same fashion that I have been outlining, to make it simpler, easier and faster, and linking up Government systems to facilitate the retrieval of information. At the end of the day, information has to come through so that the applications can be processed and that sometimes is choke point. So, we will work on digitalising the process. And also streamlining the legal requirements imposed on applicants. These, I believe, will improve the experiences of Singaporeans dealing with end-of-life issues.But even as we streamline, we must be careful that the law will continue to protect the interests of beneficiaries. This is one area where the original stakeholder or perhaps owner of the assets is not around to say how it should be done or what his intentions were. So, we do have to be careful. But within this rubric, strike an appropriate balance so that we can look out for the interests of both the convenience of the parties applying as well as also the rigours of what the interests of the beneficiaries ought to be. We will provide more details in the coming year.Ms Tan asked about unscrupulous contractors. We have seen one or more of these types of individuals at some stage and I think it is frustrating. Let me give some suggestions as what can be done.There is the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) which Mr Lim Biow Chuan can share more information on. CASE publishes a Consumer Alert List on its website. That is a useful first port of call. It lists companies that have multiple complaints made against them and operates to warn consumers about contractors with poor track records. So, to those cases that Ms Tan has spoken about where there have been repeated cases, it ought to be on this list. If not, we will try and find a way to better police it so that members of the public can be warned.If there are unfair practices, for example, false and misleading claims and so on, CASE may refer the matter to the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCS) for further action under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act. There will be sanctions against errant suppliers.Where an amicable settlement is not possible even with CASE's assistance, consumers can file claims with the Small Claims Tribunals (SCT). The SCT provides a forum that is low-cost, no lawyers are involved. For example, claimants are only required to pay $10 for claims up to $5,000 in value. And the SCT may order one party to paymoney to another party arising from these claims and also order a party to make good on deficiencies, as in the Member's example, the construction contract, for instance.Moving on, Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Sitoh Yih Pin spoke about strengthening Singapore's position as a premier international legal services and dispute resolution hub.Members will know that we are constantly looking at how we can enhance this, what we can do, what other spaces we can fill or other opportunities there will be for the Singapore brand. We look at what we can do to create value for our economy, what we can do to enhance Singapore's value-add as a business hub and of course, ultimately, providing good jobs for Singaporeans. We also want to support our people and businesses in exploiting these opportunities as far as possible.Let me touch on a few initiatives.One area in which we shall move to keep pace with the competition is in the area of conditional fee agreements (CFAs). Following public consultations last year, we are working on introducing a CFA framework for certain categories of proceedings. The framework will help our lawyers and law practices by levelling the playing field for Singaporean lawyers and law practices, as against foreign lawyers who may already be able to offer such agreements in their own jurisdictions. We are also studying whether allowing CFAs for a wider range of proceedings can further promote access to justice.Second, we are also promoting the use of Singapore law. Our initiatives include increasing free access to Singapore judgments. Steps have been taken to make more Supreme Court judgments from 2000 freely available online, and also potentially even earlier judgments, earlier than 2000. Second, encouraging published research on areas of Singapore law that are relevant to commercial parties internationally, and finally, promoting standard forms, that is, use of, straightforward, standard forms, governed by Singapore law.7.00 pmMr Sitoh Yih Pin asked about progress in dispute resolution. Singapore remains one of the leading hubs for dispute resolution in the world today. We have flagship institutions that Mr Christopher de Souza mentioned providing a full suite of such services. We have best-in-class hearing facilities at Maxwell Chambers.We will continue to strengthen that framework by supporting the eco-system for viable international dispute resolution services. We have various reviews underway, including a review of the International Arbitration Act.I had earlier mentioned the Singapore Convention on Mediation. Yes, indeed, we were one of the first two countries, together with Fiji, to ratify the Convention. This took place a few days ago in New York. These efforts, not just to get the countries to sign and to ratify, but to promote more countries to come on board, have broader implications for Singapore's place in the world. It is a powerful statement for multilateralism and has also enhanced our reputation in the international arena.We will build on the signing of the Convention last year. We will host a second annual Singapore Convention Conference in September this year. This will be part of a week-long of events related to international dispute resolution services. This conference and indeed, the week, will continue to position Singapore as a thought leader in this field and also a forum that parties can choose to come to, regardless of whether the ultimate contract or the subject matter of their agreement is in Singapore or not, to choose Singapore as a forum.In the area of civil cooperation, Mr Murali Pillai asked about the legalisation of documents. I think it is a point that Mr Murali Pillai has raised several times. The Hague Apostille Convention. We agree that this will be useful and we are currently working towards its accession. This will include preparing the necessary draft legislation domestically in order to accede to the Convention, and thereafter, we will be in the position to do so.All these efforts will create opportunities for those in the legal sector and also for those who want to enter the legal sector. On this note, Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked what the Government is doing to support lawyers and law firms to exploit these opportunities. Let me again, in the interest of time, outline a few initiatives.First, we will be launching a Technology Innovation Roadmap. What does this do? This roadmap is the product of intensive consultations with more than 80 stakeholders. This includes law firms, companies, law schools, research institutes and other Government agencies. It will help Singapore law firms understand and embrace technology to improve productivity and the quality of their legal services. Let me give one example.Altum Law Corporation is a five-lawyer strong Singapore law firm. Under the Tech Start for Law and the Tech-celerate for Law initiatives, MinLaw and the Law Society curated a shortlist of technology solutions and also vendors to help address common problems, common issues amongst smaller law firms. Grants to support up to 70% of adoptioncosts were available under the schemes.Strong efforts have been made to promote these schemes. The Law Society reached out to at least 450 Singapore law practices through workshops and seminars to promote this programme and Altum was one of those who was a participant in these events. They were able to upgrade from the standard suite of computer services – they were using Microsoft Office, I believe – to legal technology solutions that were more curated and were better suited to their needs. The firm achieved time andcost savings from automating routine but important tasks, including shortening the time required to complete the checking of references in documents by up to 66%.The Roadmap will include plans to help to continue to fund law firms, help them to understand what technology can do for their efficiency and also expand support to in-house legal teams to adopt legal technology. As Mr Patrick Tay mentioned, this reflects our belief that both those in practice as well as those in the in-house role have much to benefit from adopting legal technology.So, we will support the development of cutting-edge legal technology relevant to their work and also reform legal education to build a pipeline of tech-ready legal professionals to support the legal industry. More details will be announced later this year.Let me touch on Mr Patrick Tay's other point on mid-career PMETs. We will help such PMETs to exploit new opportunities that will be created.The Law Society and Workforce Singapore have developed a Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) to help employers hire and re-skill mid-career PMETs to join the legal sector as paralegals or legal secretaries.Paralegals and support services do play an important role in Singapore's legal industry. We note Mr Patrick Tay's suggestions and we will continue to work with the relevant stakeholders so that we can support this segment of the legal industry more closely.Third, we will be conducting the first run of the China-Ready Programme for Singapore lawyers this year. The programme will expand the pool of Singapore lawyers who understand Chinese culture, the way in which business is done, the legal system and laws; are conversant with Mandarin in the legal context; and can also work with Chinese companies and law firms to better meet clients' needs.This is one element of the Ministry's strategy to help Singapore lawyers seize new opportunities in different jurisdictions.Finally, before I run out of time, let me touch on some of the questions relating to the work of the Singapore Land Authority (SLA). SLA optimises land resources to support the economic and social development of Singapore. That is its overall mission. It plays a number of roles, including, as Mr Christopher de Souza outlined, optimising the use of state land and of course, also developing Singapore's geospatial capabilities. Let me elaborate on some key initiatives.The SLA is intensifying its efforts to engage and collaborate with stakeholders, members of the public, on the interim use of vacant State land and properties. For example, Members may be aware that SLA and URA launched the Power-Up Pasir Panjang ideas competition in April 2019, and reached out to members of the public, professionals and students to co-create ideas for the Power District.A total of 79 submissions were received, which demonstrates the interest of the public and the professional sector in trying to contribute to ideas as to what can be done. These ideas will be distilled into design principles guiding the Power District's development for the next 15 to 20 years, including the former Pasir Panjang Power Station A.In the coming weeks, SLA will also be launching engagements with stakeholders to rejuvenate the Old Kallang Airport. This is part of the Reinventing Spaces into Vibrant Places initiative that was launched with URA in 2019.SLA is also partnering NParks to develop a site at Tanglin Road into a community use space with a playground, benches, something that will appeal to members of the public.Let me now quickly finish up with the geospatial front. There will be a full launch of the OneMap 3D that will take place later this year. The map will allow users to visualise Singapore in 3D. This will support the efforts of businesses and the public, who require these services, to have new platforms to support their services and products as well as also develop services for the community at large.SLA will be launching the 3D Singapore Sandbox this year. It will facilitate private sector access to 3D geospatial models and data on a restricted basis and through this, we hope to encourage the private sector to experiment with innovative solutions and services for their customers and the general public using 3D geospatial models. The Sandbox will enable SLA to obtain feedback from the private sector to enhance the experience and to improve the geospatial models.Mr Chairman, in conclusion, my Ministry will continue to ensure that Singaporeans continue to enjoy effective access to high quality justice – that is a fundamental – and also to build on Singapore's attractiveness as a legal services hub, ensuring that the benefit of the ensuing growth will be shared by more.Importantly, we do all this not on our own but through working closely with so many stakeholders – the bench, the bar, the legal industry, the universities, law students and the wider community – and for that, we are very grateful.The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza.Mr Christopher de Souza: I thank the Senior Minister of State for his comprehensive responses. On my particular cut about Singapore being a leading international dispute resolution hub, I think one of the flagships we have, apart, obviously, from our court system, is the SIAC. The Minister would know, my question is really a nuts and bolts on how we get the model clause out. In a model clause, there is the centre, there is the rules, there is the seat and there is Singapore law being the relevant law.So, my question really is – how are we able to advance Singapore law, advance the seat of Singapore, through these clauses such that international parties come? And when international parties come, they do not come with lawyers, they come with their experts, they come with their decision-makers and their witnesses. So how can we use that space to enhance Singapore law and Singapore as an international legal hub?Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: I can speak a little more slowly now. The clock is not running. So, a model clause is useful but parties must want to come to Singapore. So having a model law is one thing, but what we want to do is to really build the eco-system that supports why a party from outside Singapore will want to choose Singapore. So, if I may summarise some of the points from my speech earlier.First, we have to make sure that Singapore law is accessible, that it is first-rate, it is commercial. Our high-quality jurispurdence coming out of our Courts help a lot in that regard for parties who want to choose Singapore law.Second, we must build a system that is neutral, that is based on the rule of law, that parties, when they come into Singapore, when they make their investments into Singapore or they choose Singapore as a forum, they know that they will get first-class hearings, hearings that will not be unduly interfered with, hearings that will be governed by the rule of law and as far as possible, in our best-in-class facilities as well, in Maxwell Chambers.Third, we want to look at the way in which our stakeholders – law firms, lawyers, those who practise here, those who practise abroad – are equipped with this information, so that when they do the negotiation, persons such as yourself, Mr Christopher de Souza or Mr Murali Pillai, can then take these learning points, take these model clauses and persuade external parties that in Singapore, we do not only have the best facilities, but we have the best, most neutral system that will ensure a fair adjudication of the disputes.I think all of these parts must come together in order for us to build a first-class and continue to sustain that first-class international dispute hub.The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza, do you want to withdraw your amendment?Mr Christopher de Souza: I was hoping to ask for another clarification, but that is all right, I can withdraw the cut.The Chairman: You have a few minutes to ask your further clarification. Last one.Mr Christopher de Souza: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I thank the Senior Minister of State for the response. My next question is on a different cut, which is – Singapore as a formidable IP fortress. I think we can protect a lot of protection and enforcement, but how is IPOS and MinLaw working with the R&D outfits to ensure that commercialisation of the IP? So, it is not only a portcullis or a fortress where we protect it but where we can enhance it into commercial terms.Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: I am not sure that is capable of a short answer but I will try. We have to first realise that no one will choose Singapore to file their patents in or to enhance or enforce their IP rights, if we do not have a strong neutral legal system. So, at the baseline, that is always something that we look at, frankly speaking.What else do we do? We want to make sure that our laws are updated. So, as I mentioned on several occasions and also earlier, we will look at enhancing and revising the Copyright Act, an experience that we have had after we did extensive consultations. What else can we do? What else can we say to people about how their ideas, their patents, their innovations will be better protected in Singapore and also enforced, should the case be necessary?Third, we also want to make sure that we be with the system from start to end. So, I mentioned in my speech earlier, IDEAS, for instance. How do you monetise the value in intangible assets? Assets that would otherwise be difficult to look at in terms of valuation. We look at how it can be done so that we can help companies raise capital, raise financing and leverage on the value of such intangible assets.When you bring all these together in the eco-system, you will then have, in Mr Christopher de Souza's words, a formidable fortress, in which to not just register but enforce and eventually enjoy filing of the patents in Singapore.When we provide the whole spectrum of services, that is when we can then go out there and tell the major companies, inventors and innovators of the world – come into Singapore. We have the entire suite of services for you, and should there be any disagreement, any dispute over the services, they will be resolved in a firm, fair and completely above board, neutral, rule-of-law fashion.I think that assurance we give to investors would be the best assurance we have in growing, perhaps, not just the IP sector but overall in our key development areas in Singapore.7.15 pmThe Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza, it is about three minutes before guillotine time, so you may have to withdraw.Mr Christopher de Souza: I am grateful, Chairman. I join my fellow parliamentarians in thanking the Senior Minister of State for his comprehensive responses and also all the hardworking officers in MinLaw and the various arms and bodies which report to MinLaw. With that, I seek your leave, Mr Chairman, to withdraw my cut.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $283,293,800 for Head R ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $145,379,100 for Head R ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates."

        "Content": "The Chairman: Head K, Ministry of Education. Ms Denise Phua.Transformation Map for MOE and SkillsFutureMs Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar): Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head K of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".More than 600,000 students are enrolled in MOE-run or supported schools, Junior Colleges and Institutes of Higher Learning. The FY2020 budgeted expenditure for Education is $13.3 billion – the third highest after defence and health; no less.Education is a unique budget item. Education, when done well, is an avenue of social mobility; a social multiplier; a maximiser of human potential; a character builder; a wealth creator and a passport to countless life’s opportunities.6.00 pmOn transformation of education, 23 industries in Singapore have developed their Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) under the Future Economy Council. Although these ITMs differ in scope, depth and quality, they share a common value-add. The mapping exercise \"forces\" industry captains to study the current and future landscape, review their vision and in the process help the rest of the industry and Singapore to understand, support and partake in their future directions, priorities, jobs and skills.Out of the 23 ITMs, the ones related to education are two – the Early Childhood Education Sector and the Adult Training and Education. The missing piece for the years between early childhood and adult education.There is merit for MOE to put together an overall Education Transformation Map. Granted, there are news on developments and priorities when MOE chooses to announce either through Ministerial Statements or its annual workplans, but the overall Education Map needs to be developed and articulated. We need to see a map that consolidates the overall vision, the future of education, the developments, the current state of the union, risk assessment, the key pieces it needs to eyeball and move, the challenges and how it can better engage other stakeholders in its work.We cannot ignore the larger elephants in the room such as the still growing and increasingly market-responsive tuition industry and the continuing excessive focus on the academic rat race. We cannot keep tweaking the system and hope that age-old mindsets and habits will disappear. Many of them cannot be solved by MOE's think tank alone. We need to be bold enough to honestly ask what our education system should look like and decide where we should re-design, re-skill and better resource. We need to bring on board more Singaporeans to help understand the aspirations, the demands and challenges we face and will face.Therefore, I urge Government to put together a team to develop and articulate an Education Transformation Map for the future.On vision of education. The fast pace of technology has led to an increasingly shorter shelf life of our knowledge and skills. Staying relevant through lifelong learning is an essential part of life and no longer a luxury. Hence, the SkillsFuture movement is a brilliant strategy but it is now focused primarily on adults and at most, students in the Institute of Higher Learning (IHLs). However, the cultivation of curiosity in learning, self-driving one's learning, digital literacy and learning agility must start young. There is therefore a need to integrate and align SkillsFuture in the adult years with SkillsFuture in the junior years.Let us be the first in the world to build the first \"Lifelong Learning Schools\". Let us re-envision MOE as a Ministry of Lifelong Learning and to seriously study what that vision truly means and entails.Next, on benchmark of education. For years, Singapore has prided ourselves in our outstanding performance in global education rankings such as the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study. PISA ranks our 15-year-olds globally in subjects such as reading, math, science and problem solving – factors viewed as important for boosting economic competitiveness.Although a good reference point, I believe Singapore can lead and establish a more comprehensive suite of education benchmarks. For one, we know we have to now learn for life beyond the age of 15. Two, surely, we too agree that the purpose of education is more than just to prepare economic beings.What about physical and mental health? What about citizenship, compassion, learning agility, curiosity, regional and world languages and culture and the courage to take risks? What about the sense of duty to look after one's family, to respect other people who are different, protect our environment including cleaning up after ourselves? What should be included and measure?I ask MOE, as we expand our old definition of education and success, I wish to seek resources for the Ministry to conduct a uniquely Singapore study of the benchmarks against which to measure the success of our education systemNext, on engine of education, our educators. Amongst all, one key engine of education must be our Educators. I have and still serve with some of the most dedicated, competent and compassionate educators; and I feel for them. We need to nurture and maximize the potential of our staff too.The days of old when teachers are the key dispensers of knowledge and principals are leaders who know all about education, are over. In fact, the term \"teacher\" may need to be dropped soon as educators take on the roles of creators and/or curators of content; designers of learning experiences; facilitators and coaches of their students. They need to be exposed not only to things of the school; but also to the world that their students are going to live and work in. They themselves, the educators, too need to be mentally healthy and coached.What are the ways by which MOE educators including school leaders are recruited and developed to fulfill the roles of future educators? How can we future-proof them through updating and innovating the ways by which they are recruited and developed?Next on inclusiveness of education, any map of education is incomplete without including those who are at risk of being left out either due to their socio-economic background; or their learning styles and abilities.Digital Literacy for AllOn digital literacy for all, many future of education studies reflect everywhere that digital literacy is the new literacy. As mobile devices become commonly used for learning, students without the financial means may be left out. In situations such as the COVID-19 outbreak, when students are expected to stay home with e-learning, with blended homework packages, those without access to ready IT devices may be deprived.Besides devices, there are also students who may be left behind in the chase of acquisition for digital literacy due to little access or exposure to digital content or sufficient learning exposure either at home or in school. What are MOE's plans to strengthen digital accessibility and literacy for all and to ensure every student has equal access to the hardware devices, the software applications and supervision, especially students in financially or socially challenged households; and especially students who are not in mainstream school setting such as those in special schools or home-schooling settings?Special Educational Needs in Schools/IHLsOn student with Special Education Needs (SEN), thanks to the political leaders and several key Ministries such as MSF and MOE, the education of students with SEN specially for the young has grown from strength to strength. However, the outcomes of their schooling will need a deeper dive for further improvement. To this end, I seek MOE's favourable consideration for three groups of students with SEN.One, for Special Education (SPED) school students who are unlikely to proceed to open employment or further studies, MOE should consider extending the current school years of SPED schools to age 21. This is to enhance the chances that more of them will be more prepared for life after school, the foremost school years and for more of them to work in at least supported employment. Many of them are not ready to exit to the adult world at the age of 18. The alternative is to put them incostly day activity centres for adults or for parents to give up their own livelihoods in order to care for them.Next, for students with SEN who are able to undertake mainstream subjects whether in Primary schools, Secondary schools or IHLs, MOE should articulate and implement a more effective plan so that they are better supported. For instance, the SEN funds in IHLs are currently only limited to those with sensory disabilities – those who are visually impaired or deaf – and they are not extended currently to those with ADHD, dyslexia or autism.For everyone with SENs, learning with the appropriate support should not stop after the formal school years. There are insufficient efforts to include the special needs workforce in the SkillsFuture movement. Neither is there enough envisioning of a lifelong learning pathway for this special group of learners. I therefore call for a deeper dive by MOE and other key stakeholders such as the major disability SSAs to address this important need. Failing to do so will incur not only further expenditure in future budgets, but, we as a society would also be for the weaker when we leave them behind.In conclusion, Sir, in summary, I seek MOE's favourable consideration of my suggestions to one, develop and articulate an Education Transformation Map for the future. Two, to re-envision and re-name the MOE to as a top-notch Ministry of Lifelong Learning. Three, review the benchmarks against which to measure the success of our education system. Four, to future-proof our educators through updating and innovating the ways by which they are recruited and developed. Five, ensure digital accessibility and literacy for all especially those from lower income households and/or with SEN. And lastly, to provide stronger support to the lifelong learning of students with SEN in all settings. Finally, I want to thank everyone who chose to serve in the education sector, your influence stays even after you are long gone.Question proposed.Joy of LearningMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten): Sir, learning in schools should not be a process whereby a student studies simply to pass exams. Many subjects which a student learn in school may not be relevant years later because of new discoveries and technological developments. Yet, many students and their parents continue to obsess over the need to learn to pass exams. Students worry about their academic performance in schools. This has led to unnecessary stress on the students.For the past years, during the Edusave Awards ceremony, I urge parents to work with the school teachers to inculcate the joy of learning in their children. The students should not be caught up in trying to memorise their textbooks just to score better results. Instead, they ought to be given exposure to discovering new things and finding out more about topics in which they are interested in. Learning must be for life because the world keeps changing and developing over the years.When I first started legal practice, I had to learn how to use a Phillips word processor. I then attended classes to learn how to use Wordstar and Word Perfect. If I did not keep learning, I would not be able to manage without knowing Microsoft Office today.I know that MOE wants to encourage the students to appreciate that education should be a life long journey. But, it is not enough for MOE to say so. The school teachers must buy in and not add stress onto the students by having a continuous stream of tests and exams. Regardless of what MOE says, if assessments and tests are graded and counted as your overall results, students will continue to mug for these assessments and these tests.I urge MOE to consider more options to admit students to their schools of choice; to their courses of studies instead of simply relying on their exam results. Consider relying on aptitude tests or interviews to ascertain a student's interest. In this way, we will be better able to persuade students and parents that it is important to develop a child's interest in learning and enjoy acquiring knowledge.Update on Learn for Life InitiativesMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok): Sir, I seek an update from the hon Minister on Learn for Life initiatives following the important announcement made at last year'sCOSdebates about the Full Subject-Based Banding in Secondary Schools. This comes in the wake of other initiatives such as the revamped PSLE scoring this year onwards and enlarging aptitude-based admissions into tertiary institutions.I had the opportunity to review the speech of Minister Ong Ye Kung made in 2018 when he held out elderly learners from our Pioneer and Merdeka Generations imbibed with the \"lifelong learning\" attitudes as great examples for our children to follow and build resilience in a fast changing global economy.One such example is Mr Albert Chang, aged 70 years. When he was 14 years old, he left Queenstown Secondary School to work and take care of his family consisting of six siblings, including himself. He joined the Naval Base, which was still managed by the British then, as an electrical engineering apprentice. After the British withdrawal, he became a weapons specialist with SEEL, one of the 2 companies that took over the base and which later merged with ST.Eager to upgrade himself, he attended night classes after work at the Lembaga which was set up in 1960 to promote adult education. He passed his \"O\" level exams through this route. With an in-house scholarship from SEEL, he went to Singapore Polytechnic to pursue a diploma in telecommunication engineering. On his own, he pursued a City & Guilds of London Institute course and was issued with a Full Technological Certificate in electrical engineering practice specialising in instruments in 1972. Thereafter, he was employed in several companies. One memorable project he undertook was the installation of the cable car system from Mount Faber to Sentosa as a Project Manager.During the recession, engineering jobs dried up, he was made redundant, he joined the insurance industry. This was not his comfort zone but he was determined to give it his best shot. He then, through self-study, he became a Chartered Life Underwriter.However, engineering remained his first love, he went back. In mid-2000s, he pursued a Double Masters in Project Management and Risk Management. He retired in 2015. He still is attending courses and presentations at NTU. He is now focusing on upgrading his IT knowledge, learning Python and so on. The values and attitudes of Mr Chang and the people of his generation were shaped by Singapore's —The Chairman: Mr Murali Pillai, could you wrap up, please? Thank you.Mr Murali Pillai: — Singapore's humble economic circumstances in the 1960s and 1970s. The concern for us is how we can replicate their drive for lifelong learning in our children in these times when we are generally well-off.6.15 pmEducation System InitiativesMr Charles Chong (Punggol East): Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the only thing which is constant about the world is that everything will change at some point. Indeed, the rate of change we are experiencing gets quicker and quicker every year. For example, by some estimates, the amount of data in the world doubles every two years.The difficulty we face is how we get our youths ready for the future when we do not know for certain what the future holds. If we do not know what the future is going to look like, then it makes it immensely difficult to predict the skills that will be needed for the future.But what is clear is that we need our youths to be resilient, adaptable and have a global outlook. To keep pace with changes in the world, we must teach our youths to keep an open mind and to be willing to learn and re-learn throughout their lives. In short, we need to make lifelong learning second nature for our youths. That seems to be the most effective way to make the next generation of Singaporeans ready for the future.Could the Minister share what steps are being taken to encourage our youths to learn for life?Mr Chairman, last year, I spoke about how our education system can better cater to the unique strengths and interests of our students by providing more opportunities for differentiated learning, depending on the student's ability at a particular point in time. Now, I was encouraged by MOE's move towards full subject-based banding (FSBB) which, I understand, is being piloted in 28 Secondary schools this year. The outcomes and the students' experiences in this pilot project will provide useful learning points as the Ministry finally rolls out FSBB to all Secondary schools.I am interested, however, to hear what the experiences of the 28 pilot schools are and how they have found the move to FSBB. Could the Minister give an update on the pilot and how successful or otherwise this has been?Finally, Mr Chairman, I would like to address the need for support of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Quality education should be accessible to all Singaporeans, regardless of family background. The Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce (UPLIFT) was set up in October 2018 to see how we can help address the challenges that children from poorer backgrounds face, so that they are able to benefit fully from our education system and go on to maximise their potential.As it has already been a year and a half since UPLIFT was set up, I would like to ask the Minister if he could provide an update on the work and progress of this taskforce.Mother TongueMs Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Singapore is a multiracial, multi-cultural country with unique history and characteristics. Since independence, the bilingual policy has been the cornerstone of our education system. It helps different races to communicate with one another and also plays an indispensable role in promoting cohesion and harmony within the society.However, language, as a tool of communication, is only one part of its functions. It is underpinned by culture, which is the key feature of a nation and a key achievement of human civilisation. In order to have a deeper understanding of our culture and reinforce our identity, a firm grasp of our mother tongue is key.With rapid globalisation, Singaporeans must continue to have a good grasp of two languages and two cultures, and even more languages to stay ahead. This will enhance the competitiveness of Singaporeans internationally and help strengthen Singapore's role as an economic and cultural bridge between different parts of the world.Furthermore, a good grasp of our mother tongue is beneficial for our personal development. Researchers have found that learning two languages can stimulate our mental development, especially for children learning multiple languages at a young age. Benefits for these children include improved cognitive ability, concentration and memory, and greater flexibility when the brain needs to switch between mental tasks. The variety of vocabulary and expressions in different languages also affects our ability to gain insights about the world. People who speak multiple languages have a more enriched understanding of the world compared to monolingual individuals.Our country's bilingual policy has undergone several reforms, and has laid a good language foundation for Singaporeans. However, with changes in the world and the global economy, Singapore's bilingual advantage is now being tested and challenged.I would like to ask MOE: how can we provide a good environment for our students to learn mother tongue and also nurture interest in their mother tongue? We have now moved from nurturing bilingual talents to nurturing bicultural talents, and this signals progress in our bilingual policy. In this regard, what are MOE’s new measures to nurture even more bicultural talents?Learning of Mother TongueMr Lim Biow Chuan: Because this is a cut on Mother Tongue, let me try to speak in Mandarin. It is going to be a terrible experience, speaking after the eloquent Ms Tin Pei Ling.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]When I was young, I did not speak Mandarin very often, partly because my parents spoke Hokkien to me at home and my brothers and sisters only spoke to me in English. So Mandarin was alien to me. When I was studying law in the University, I read the English law papers every day.It was a cause of regret for me when I graduated because I did not have a good grasp of my Mother Tongue. When I try to speak Mandarin to my clients, they would say \"It is better that you speak English.\" When I joined the Grassroots organisations, I discovered that if I spoke Mandarin more frequently, I could grasp it too. Several months ago, Prime Minister Lee said more and more people were speaking Mandarin at home. How can MOE encourage our students to learn, speak and use Mandarin more?(In English): Let me now try to speak in English so that MOE officers can understand what I say.Sir, when I was young, I seldom spoke in Mandarin. This is partly because my parents spoke to me in Hokkien at home and my siblings speak to me in English. When I was studying in the University, it was worst, because hardly anyone spoke Mandarin at all. We were all reading English law reports.It is a cause of regret for me when I graduated because I did not have a good grasp of my Mother Tongue. I could not speak Mandarin well to my clients. But, later, when I joined the grassroots organisations, I realised that the more you speak, the more you get confidence in speaking the Mother Tongue.As more and more people speak English at home, is the learning of Mother Tongue adversely affected? How can MOE help students to become more proficient in learning Mother Tongue?Would it be better for the students to have a nurturing environment at home or would it be better to have more specialist schools, where the students can be immersed in an environment where more classmates speak the Mother Tongue? May I ask the Minister: how can MOE make learning Mother Tongue more enjoyable and help students better appreciate their Mother Tongue as well as their own culture?The Chairman: 其实,你的华语讲得很好。掌声鼓励鼓励。Actually, you speak Mandarin well. We encourage you. [Applause.]Learning the National LanguageMr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied): Sir, I would like to renew my call for the learning of basic conversational Bahasa Melayu to be included in the regular curriculum for all our Primary school children who do not otherwise learn it.I understand that our school children have a great deal to learn already and we are concerned about their well-being. But, perhaps, they could learn the National Language without the pressure of examinations. I also understand that the school curriculum needs to reflect a balance of many different priorities. But it is precisely because of this that I call for its inclusion. And I do so in different years at our Budget discussions because teaching all our school children Bahasa Melayu speaks to many of our enduring values and our hopes that are reflected in successive Budgets – economic development through regional cooperation, building a strong and united Singapore.Sir, to begin with, learning Bahasa Melayu will be good for the cognitive and intellectual development of our children who learn it as a Third Language. It will also protect and preserve our multiculturalism and promote national integration and a sense of identity rooted in our geography and our history.Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) in SchoolsDr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio): Chairman, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is an integral part of our education system, complementing our academic subjects with a more value-centric and action-based approach to understanding ourselves and the community and society we live in.MOE has made significant and impactful changes to the way we deliver CCE to our students, with the last review done in 2014. Hence, it is timely that MOE reviews the CCE syllabus. As MOE does so, I would like to oﬀer three suggestions for consideration.First, issues related to mental health and wellness should be incorporated in the CCE syllabus even at the Primary school level. Our young students need to be provided with a safe space to discuss issues that may have an impact on their mental health and wellness, such as coping with loss or death in the family, appropriate and inappropriate relationships, bullying among friends, social discrimination or domestic violence. These are diﬃcult issues and I would not expect all our school teachers to be professionally equipped to address them or help students manage these issues well. Hence, it would be useful to have social workers and trained school counsellors work closely with our school teachers to help young students who may be facing these issues.Second, in the midst of the current COVID-19 outbreak, it is important to incorporate lessons on personal hygiene as well as personal and community values that shape social responsibility. Such lessons serve as important reminders to our young students about how our personal hygiene practices can have significant and far-reaching impact on the community we live in and on society at large. For instance, when we are ill, it is important to maintain good personal hygiene and exercise social responsibility by minimising going out in public, not sneezing or coughing without due care and maintaining social distancing with others.In addition, our personal and community values shape our social responsibility. For instance, self-centredness and a lack of empathy for others mean we only think of ourselves and make us less \"others-centric\". While it is understandable for each of us to want to protect our personal interests and needs, we can still do so and yet look out for others, show our care for them and extend help where needed.Third, we know that values are more often caught rather than taught. Parents' values, beliefs and behaviours will most certainly shape how their children treat others and how they behave towards others. Hence, parental involvement in the teaching and learning of CCE would enhance its value. I know that schools are already doing this. Other than involving parents in some learning activities to be done at home with their children, parents who have been actively involved in serving the community, doing volunteer work or actively contributing to society can be invited to share their experience and work with a class of students in school. These parents serve as significant adults who can positively influence and shape the mindsets of our young students, which can be important for students who may not always have the best role models at home.I look forward to hearing the details of how MOE intends to review and enhance the teaching of CCE in our schools.CCEMr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol): Chairman, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) has always been at the heart of Singapore's education system. In CCE, our students learn to be responsible to family and community, and understand their role in shaping the future of our nation. The current syllabus was implemented in 2014 and, ever since, there has been new emerging trends and global developments that can impact our society. Last year, the Minister for Education shared that educators expend much effort to continuously improve and refine the curriculum and to make it more engaging, relatable and effective. Could the Ministry provide an update on the review and the enhancements that would be made to our CCE curriculum to ensure our children are anchored on strong moral values?Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong): Chairman, I believe that CCE is an important part of our education. Some students, however, think that CCE is a chore or, worse, think that is merely propaganda. Perhaps, they do not appreciate its relevance, especially if examinations are around the corner.I urge the Ministry to consider how to make CCE more engaging and robust. One way is to draw from current happenings to start discussions in CCE lessons. For instance, teachers can engage students to reflect on the challenges posed by the on-going COVID-19 outbreak and discuss how best our communities can respond. Students can discuss how everyone can play a part in being socially responsible. This is especially relevant when one of the students in a top school was infected with COVID-19 last week.When we include more of such relatable content, CCE lessons can become less of a chore to our students. It would also enable teachers to more effectively guide students towards making sound moral judgements and be motivated to contribute to society.Teaching of Thinking Skills in SchoolsMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member): Sir, aside from teaching our students content and, of course, developing soft skills, character and values, I would argue that nurturing critical thinking skills is of paramount importance. This is particularly so in light of how the world economy is changing and how more basic types of intellectual work are increasingly going to be handled by technology.In fact, as I referred to in my Budget speech, the authors of the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report 2019 commented that Singapore has room for improvement in developing skills like critical thinking among its workforce.Going forward, clarity about the sources of knowledge and higher level thinking are going to be key.6.30 pmOne aspect of critical thinking which I want to focus on for this cut is conscious reflection on thinking, thought processes, the rules of logic and the principles of knowledge– how we know something is true and the various categories of knowledge. It is important that our students are encouraged to think about thinking itself. For example, they should know how to reduce an argument to its basic form to separate the premises from the conclusion to understand what the tautological statement is to understand the difference between causation and correlation and to be familiar with the various forms of reasoning like deductive and inductive. The International Baccalaureate programme includes a Theory of Knowledge (TOK) module. On the IB website, this is described as aiming to make students aware of the interpretative nature of knowledge, including personal ideological biases, \"to reflect critically on diverse ways of knowing and on areas of knowledge; to be aware of themselves as thinkers, encouraging them to become more acquainted with the complexity of knowledge.\"The most central question the TOK addresses is, \"How do we know?\", while other questions include: \"What counts as evidence for X?\", \"How do we judge which is the best model of Y?\", \"What does Theory Z mean in the real world?\" Some elements of this are covered in the Upper Secondary English curriculum, but not all. This goes beyond language and media literacy, and it is really about the philosophy of knowledge. As most of our students are not in the IB programme, I would like to ask if this is currently being addressed in our Secondary school curriculum and, if so, in what ways? And if MOE is examining modules like the IBs TOK, to explore how we might enhance our teaching approaches in this regard.Improving CCEMiss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines): Sir, for a long time, our schools have played an indispensable role in anchoring our students on strong moral values. In my speech in the debate on the President's Address in 2018, I mentioned that our CCE syllabus then focused on classroom and theoretical knowledge. I said, \"Our young people should walk the talk and we should seed the caring hearts of our next generation. Let them adopt a kindergarten, old folks home, pet shelters and the responsibility of caring for others.\"It is important that we look into how we can develop age-appropriate strategies for students at different age groups so as to increase the effectiveness of CCE in schools. Can Minister share if MOE has been looking into this? To strike a chord with students, CCE should also be easily relatable to the students' experiences.Therefore, is it possible for CCE lessons to be conducted beyond classrooms and even more actively utilise the life experiences of the teachers so that the lessons could be more authentic?Incorporating Climate Change in EducationNext cut. Sir, last year, I filed a cut on teaching Green in school. We have to inculcate green values in younger generation. Our schools can play a big and important role in educating our students on the importance of Green initiatives and the perils of global warming. They should also be better informed of the sciences and policies in relation to climate change.We should make it part of the compulsory curriculum. Let us educate them on the Semakau landfills that are running out in 2035, instead of 2045. Schools can also take the lead in the reduction of single-use plastics and instill a recycling mindset, including handing down used textbooks and using recycled textbooks.Can the Minister share what MOE has done so far and if MOE can consider embedding sustainability into the curriculum?Character and Citizenship CurriculumMr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang): Chairman, I would like to ask MOE if there will be an update to the Character and Citizenship Curriculum since it was last introduced in 2014 and, if so, what are the changes to make CCE more relevant. Like Miss Cheng Li Hui, I would like to ask if there will be changes to increase awareness of climate change and the human impact on both the environment and nature.This awareness should also be balanced with an acknowledgement of the economic and other constraints that we face, as well as being mindful of the limited impact that we can make as a small country.Cyber Wellness and Mental HealthDr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang): Mr Chairman, mental health issues are silent, invisible killers. Suicide is the leading cause of death for those who are aged between 10 and 29. The second Singapore Mental Health Study by the Institute of Mental Health released in 2018 reveals that one out of seven Singaporeans experiences a mental health condition in their lifetime. The number of young Singaporeans between the ages of 16 and 30 who sought help from IMH's community health assessment team from 2015 to 2017 has seen an increase of 190%. Hence, the rising rates of mental health issues among our children and youths are an urgent national challenge and priority.There are many possible causes that may exacerbate the mental health issues, such as academic-based (homework, examinations, projects) or relationship-based (friendship and bullying). The rise of social media has also created self-image issues that have led many to have unrealistic expectations.I would like to propose the following measures to MOE.(a) Destigmatise mental health issues and increase the number of counsellors in the schools. Make seeing the school counsellor mandatory for all students, instead of only referring those who are suspected of mental health issues to the school counsellors;(b) Integrate mental health as part of CCA and physical fitness programmes into the schools and rename it as Total Fitness Programme;(c) Introduce mindfulness and meditation classes to all schools and equip our young Singaporeans with useful skills to deal with stress for life;(d) Strengthen our cyber wellness programme in schools and equip our young Singaporeans with skills and knowledge to deal with the cyber jungle; and(e) Further enhance character and citizenship education.The current occasional talks in schools on mental wellness is clearly insufficient and is only scratching the surface. I hope MOE can seriously look into this urgent national challenge and consider the measures proposed.Asia-Ready Exposure ProgrammeMs Foo Mee Har (West Coast): Mr Chairman, shifts in the global economic centre of gravity towards Asia present immense opportunities for our people. Singapore is well-placed to leverage opportunities from fast-growing Asia, in particular, Southeast Asia. Many Singapore companies see Asia as its marketplace, given the limited growth opportunities in our small domestic market.So, to prepare our future generation to be Asia-ready, I am really happy that we are reviewing our school curriculum to enable students to develop a deeper understanding of ASEAN, China and India. Deputy Prime Minister Heng announced the \"70-70\" target for a new Asia-Ready Exposure Programme. I would like to ask the Minister to provide more details about this programme. How can this new programme provide our students with the opportunity to develop deep insights into the Asian economies and their ways of working and living?I certainly hope this Programme will not just stop at being an overseas trip to the region. Indeed, the programme should instead encompass student involvement in community service engagement with the respective Asian communities, working in close collaboration with foreign embassies and student exchange programmes.Most importantly, to support our students, it is to expand their language skills to include those of the region. I would like to ask the Minister whether the Government would support the setting up of MOE-funded ASEAN language schools and whether the mastery of these languages can form part of the mainstream curriculum and be credit-bearing?The Chairman: Mr Teo Ser Luck. Take your two cuts, please.Asia ReadyMr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol): Chairman, I have two young staff in their late 20s who are working for me. Since then, I have worked with them very closely on different projects. And because my companies, we build our offices regionally, so the two of them I empower them to take on some of those projects. I must say that the two of them have a lot of promises and one of the common things I found was that they are very comfortable discussing about developments in Asia and being very resourceful about getting certain things done, even if it is beyond Singapore's shores.So, countries we talked about are China, Malaysia and Indonesia. I am quite pleased with their performance but I know it is hard to keep them. One of the common things I found was that they were exposed to cultural exchange programmes way back in school, starting from Secondary school. I will credit that as the first exposure on a regional basis that makes them feel comfortable in their working life later on.One of them actually had an Internship overseas as well. And that stint of about one and a half months he actually did really well. He did really well and you can tell from the knowledge that he has gained. I was quite glad that Deputy Prime Minister Heng announced about the \"70-70\" Asia-Ready Exposure Programme because I believe that when we give more of our students more of those exposures, it would help them in future, not just in their career, but companies that operate in Singapore or Singapore companies that want to venture overseas. ThisAsia-Ready Exposure Programme, if it can go beyond just cultural understanding and differences, it would really help to make that leap forward, and that leap forward is going beyond understanding about the culture, appreciating the culture, but to be able to make that leap into something more.And that something more, I will look at it this way–three points, mindset change. And a mindset change creates a certain attitude towards the region and the dare to venture abroad. Secondly, it is to be able to apply that learning. After learning about a culture, learn to apply that within the workforce or within their scope of work in future and to take on additional responsibilities from there. And, of course, hopefully, they are all willing to venture abroad. And that is the part I find it the hardest to persuade. I believe it is the comfort of Singapore as well that they are unable or unwilling to really venture abroad on a longer term basis to actually see what is out there, broaden their horizon.Global Ready TalentI think that is extremely important because if we want to do anAsia-Ready Exposure Programme, we might have to think beyond just understanding of cultures. Start them young right, but actually push them a bit further. I know that MTI has a Global-ready Exposure Programme and the Global-ready Exposure Programme was about internship and maybe offer a through train from Asia-ready to Global-ready; from cultural understanding to internship opportunities.Have companies offer those positions for them. But have the schools take them on in the beginning to understand that and then offer it later that they can actually intern overseas as well. Give them a chance to do so, so that, in future, Singaporeans will be more competitive, not just in Singapore, but overseas as well.Learning ASEAN LanguagesMr Murali Pillai: Sir, my Parliamentary colleagues, Mr Teo Ser Luck and Ms Foo Mee Har, had just highlighted Deputy Prime Minister Heng's \"70-70\" target in his Budget Statement as well as the Asia-Ready Exposure Programme. This comes on the heels of measures already announced this year and last year for enterprises to take advantage of business opportunities in fast growing Asia and, more specifically, ASEAN.To help our students take full advantage of these opportunities, I wonder if the Ministry is prepared to extend to students an opportunity to learn ASEAN languages. Currently, the MOE Language Centre provides Malay (Special Programme) and Indonesian languages as Third Languages. These options are only open to students ranked in the top 10% of their PSLE cohort.I would suggest that less rigorous spoken ASEAN language courses be extended to interested students, including students from IHLs. Such measures, I believe, will greatly facilitate the students' learning experience and enhance job opportunities for them in the ASEAN region.Digital and Information LiteracyDr Intan Azura Mokhtar: Chairman, in helping our citizens navigate their way through numerous online falsehoods and fake news, we have to start our public education campaign upstream and begin with our school students. In last year's Committee of Supply (COS) debates, it was announced that the Government would establish the \"Our Singapore Fund for Digital Readiness\", which aims to support community initiatives that promote digital readiness. Beyond community initiatives, we also need to equip our school students with digital literacy, as well as information literacy.Digital and information literacy is the ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills.This combined set of literacies is crucial in this current age, as our students should not only know how to use new information and communication technologies but, more importantly, know how to source for, evaluate and use information that is disseminated and accessed, regardless of the medium in which it exists.Hence, as MOE reviews the school curricula and syllabi in order to incorporate teaching and learning activities for digital readiness, I would like to propose two areas for consideration.One, digital and information literacy should be part of our school syllabi, taught and learnt within a specific subject or as part of a school project. Digital and information literacy essentially involves applied skills and knowledge. Hence, they cannot be taught in silo and has to be contextualised. I would further propose that MOE work closely with the National Library Board which has, for several years, implemented its S.U.R.E. programme, which stands for Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate.NLB has extensive experience in the area of digital and information literacy and has recently set up a Digital and Information Literacy Community of Practice (DIL-CoP), which brings together academics, practitioners and experts in the area of digital and information literacy to share experience, theory and practice in strengthening policies, research, strategies and initiatives in the area. Here, I must declare my interest as Special Adviser to the DIL-CoP.Two, in order to facilitate the learning of digital and information literacy, the access to and use of information and communication technologies, have to be in place. As such, students need to have ready access to and use of technological devices such as laptops, tablets, and smart phones – all with internet access and wireless fidelity capabilities. How will MOE ensure that our students can have their own technological devices and ready Internet access, particularly for students who come from less privileged backgrounds? What support and provision will be made available?I look forward to hearing the details of how digital and information literacy will be implemented in our schools.6.45 pmDigital Literacy in SchoolsMiss Cheng Li Hui: Chairman, digital technologies have progressed tremendously and are very much part of our lives. They could allow us to achieve more than ever before if we are able to harness their potential and use them wisely with good purpose.Cyber crimes and online scams have been on the rise and it is not surprising with majority of Singaporeans accessing the Internet everyday across different platforms.In 2016, I filed a MOE cut on cyber education. Our children are tech savvy, but they may or may not be Internet savvy. They may forget there are real dangers lurking in the cyberspace. Cyber bullying, online predators and online scams are just some of the dangers youths face.It is important that we introduce and equip our young Singaporeans with digital literacy in schools. We have made a good start and laid a strong foundation over the last few years when schools started allowing students to use tablets in class. This allows for more enriching classroom experience where learning is now more interactive, interesting and personal.Will the Ministry consider providing additional subsidies for students from lower income family to purchase devices? Will the Ministry also be developing guides or courses for teachers to impart and deepen digital literacy among their students in schools?We need to better prepare young Singaporeans for an increasing number of sectors that require advanced AI-related competencies such as digital finance and cybersecurity. Can the Minister share what is in the pipeline to deepen digital capabilities especially in our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs)?Digital TrainingMr Ang Wei Neng: Chairman, please allow me to declare my interest as CEO of ComfortDelGro Taxi business. Over the last decade, digital technology, including but not limited to mobile phone applications technology, has significantly impact on our daily life. Digital technology has disrupted many business models but has also created about new business models.In ComfortDelGro Taxi business, we have embarked on digital transformation since 2018. We have formed agile squads, hire data scientists, hire people with digital marketing skills, hire millennials with user experience or user interface skill sets, hire project managers that can manage the IT programmers that are based at the offshore development centres in India, Myanmar and so on. We are hiring many Infocomms or ICT talents but we cannot get enough local ICT talents. We are not alone. Many technology-based companies and companies that are embarking in digital transformation are finding it hard to recruit local ICT talents in the areas of data analytics, artificial intelligence, automation and other cutting-edge technologies.As we transform our economy to be digital-focused, we need our six local universities to produce more ICT talents. Thus, I will like to ask the Minister how many ICT graduates have our six local universities produced in the last three years? Moving ahead, are the local universities planning to produce even more ICT graduates? How are our local universities equipping the non-IT undergraduates with skill sets to interpret data and basic ICT skills so that they can better survive in this digital world? For that matter, how is MOE developing plans to better equip students from Primary to Secondary school to be digital ready?Online LearningMr Chen Show Mao: Sir, the COVID-19 outbreak will likely give a critical lift to the growth of technological applications that seem ripe for wider adoption now and in all likelihood will remain more widely-adopted post-COVID-19, for example, video conferencing. Sir, may I ask for an update of the Ministry’s views on how online learning fits into the education of our school children and the Ministry's plans relating to its development?Professional Development of EducatorsMiss Cheng Li Hui: Sir, education is an entire eco-system consisting of key stakeholders such as teachers, schools, parents and the wider community. Our educators are at the frontline where they deal directly with the students for many of their formative years to impart knowledge, share experience and, most importantly, lead by example. Therefore, supporting our teachers is key to developing and sustaining a good education system in Singapore.With new developments and trends in the education field such as the increasing use of e-learning, computational skills and inquiry-based learning, we need to stand ready to ensure that our teachers and educators stay ahead of the curve. It is an important and never ending process so that our teachers are well-equipped to nurture future-ready learners. Can the Minister share how will MOE support the professional development of our teachers?Mental Well-beingAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member): Chairman, Sir, youth suicides seem to be on the rise. In 2018, the figures spiked to 94 youths, between the ages of 10 and 29. MOE and MSF were very concerned with the spike, though both Ministries noted that it was not a trend yet.Obviously, we do not want this to become a trend as lives are at stake here. We need to do more than to closely monitor the issue.At the same time that youth suicides are on the rise, we see more young people talking about mental illness and turning to Mental Health Services for help. IMH has reported the young people seeking help has jumped by 190% from 2015 to 2017.I am aware that there are initiatives such as the Youth Corps programme to mobilise volunteers to provide peer support. There also many community initiatives responding to the impending youth mental health crisis. The Government can and must do more. We need to tackle mental health issues upstream and this is why I am bringing this up under the MOE heading because our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning are the headwaters of this issue. It is not just that the stress of school work creating anxieties and problems with self-worth but young people are so caught up in social relationships and the search for identity in the setting of schools.A lot of the initiatives on the ground now are oriented towards creating awareness of the issue. This is important as we need to correct persistent prejudices and ignorance. Singapore is specially equipped to tackle this issue because we have a centralised education system and MOE can do so much more.Firstly, mental health education should be a top priority and made mandatory. It should not be just a topic in character and citizenship education, or during the form teacher's guidance period but a subject in its own right in Secondary schools in which basic psychological knowledge can also be imparted so that young people can have the tools to understand what they might be going through.Secondly, we will benefit from input from young people themselves. One of the reasons for the jump in young people seeking help is that they are starting to open up mental health issues. It is time for us to listen to young people. We could learn from other jurisdictions such as Scotland, which has established a Youth Commission on Mental Health. It comprises young people from ages 16 to 25 to make recommendations to Government.Professional Development of TeachersMr Murali Pillai: Sir, hon Members will agree that the positive education outcomes and results achieved by our children are in large part due to our corp of dedicated and high-quality teachers – past and present.To ensure that we continue to have these positive outcomes, it is imperative that we provide strong support to allow our teachers to deepen their skills and expertise as part of their professional development.Deputy Prime Minister Heng highlighted in his Budget Statement this year that with shorter technology cycles, skills acquired need to be constantly refreshed. This is applicable to teachers, too.Also, the recent policy shifts in our education system such as the \"Learn for Life\" initiative will also require our teachers to undergo some level of re-tooling.With respect to how professional development is conducted, I have received feedback from teachers that attending courses per se would not necessarily result in a positive classroom impact. This is backed by empirical studies on teacher development going back 30 years. They, instead, suggest that the teacher development courses be structured less formally and allow for more interaction, collaboration, reflection and feedback between teachers to refine their skills.The courses should also be tailored and differentiated in accordance with the experience of teachers, subject, ability of students and specific strengths of the teachers.It would also be good for a ground-up approach to be employed; allowing teacher leaders to find out what is required by his unit and then collaborate with and hold peer discussions on the areas identified. These leaders should also be able to reach out to resources for help outside their school, if necessary.Finally, the courses should also be planned in a way that the teachers are not required to miss lessons. If that happens, the teacher will have to conduct a make-up lesson or get someone to cover him or her. This may not be ideal. Perhaps, an appropriate number of days should be set aside from the outset for professional development so that such time would be taken into account in the teacher’s schedule. This will also manifest a tangible investment in our teachers' professional development.SkillsFuture and Work ReadinessDr Intan Azura Mokhtar: Chairman, since the introduction of SkillsFuture in 2015, there have been numerous initiatives and programmes launched to ensure Singaporeans have access to a whole spectrum of training and learning opportunities.While there are SkillsFuture schemes meant for working adults to ensure their continued employability, such as P-Max Place-and-Train and the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCP), there are also Train-and-Place SkillsFuture initiatives targeted at students to prepare them for the workforce, such as the Work-Study Diploma or Degree programmes.The recent Budget announcement by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat gave us a sneak into the Next Bound of SkillsFuture. Among the specific initiatives under the Next Bound of SkillsFuture are the increased capacity of SkillsFuture Work-Study programmes; partnership with Queen Bee companies to better support training of potential and current hires; and the deepening of workplace learning capabilities, including the expansion of the National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning (NACE) to two more Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs).Hence, I would like to find out more about the\tplans\ton\thow\tthe\tSkillsFuture\tWork-Study programmes will be expanded; what are some Queen Bee companies that SkillsFuture Singapore will partner with; which two IHLs will be appointed to house the new NACEs; and what are the plans in expanding opportunities for workplace learning? Will there be plans to recognise training courses or certifications to allow them to be stackable components or modules leading to accredited or recognised qualifications that can lead to career promotions or better employment opportunities? I look forward to hearing these details from the Ministry.SkillsFuture MovementMs Foo Mee Har: Mr Chairman, I would like to declare my interest as the CEO of Wealth Management Institute, a training provider.The SkillsFuture movement received a boost of support in this year’s Budget with generous SkillsFuture Credit.Sir, together with the heavily-subsidied course fees that SkillsFuture courses provide as well as support from Adapt and Grow programmes, Singaporeans are well supported to confront the profound structural changes taking place in the labour market and economy. The SkillsFuture measures should motivate them to beef up their skills, re-tool themselves and chart their own future career. This round of top-ups must be utilised before 2025 – a condition that should signal urgency and spur many into action, especially those aged 40 to 60.So far, the inertia in take-up can be attributed partly to perceived relevance of SkillsFuture courses and the challenges faced by mid-career workers in navigating the thousands of courses available. For the next phase of SkillsFuture movement, more focus should be placed on building strong connections between employability and CET courses. There should be clear linkages between job opportunities, the skills required and the CET courses.We should roll out an online SkillsFuture Career Guidance tool to help individuals assess their own competencies and credentials against skills required in job vacancies in growth clusters, and direct them to relevant CET courses to develop proficiency in the required competencies. In the process, they can also be directed to career coaches for support and guidance on their learning journey to better understand career prospects in the identified sectors.There should be strong incentives for CET providers to establish links between their training courses and on-the-job performance and employment outcomes.Sir, training is most effective when it is closely linked to specific job requirements. The initiative to identify up to 40 large anchor enterprises to support training for their sectors and value chain partners, is indeed very timely. This initiative can potentially transform the entire supply chain, helping to raise the skills of workers in SMEs who form an integral part of the supply chain. Sir, I am really keen to hear the Minister in providing more details about this Anchor Enterprise programme.I have been a strong proponent of Work-Study programmes, as they can be very effective in preparing our students to be job-ready in the world of work. I am also heartened, like Dr Intan, to hear the ambitious goal to make this a mainstream pathway, with the declared ambition of 12% of each cohort. Work-study pathways can only be successful with strong industry partnership, commitment on the part of employers and their management teams to make workplace learning meaningful and impactful.What plans are in the pipeline to build that necessary infrastructure and eco-system for impactful work-study programmes? What support will companies receive to enable their effective participation in work-study programmes?Post-Secondary Education AccountMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied): The Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) is a useful mechanism for young individuals to help defray thecost of their education. However, I am perplexed by the strict limitations placed on PSEA usage.In a recent Parliamentary answer, MOE has said that the Ministry was concerned about the quality of the courses, the relevance to the industry and the outcomes to the graduates. Although this is fair enough, it should be remembered that we are talking here about an individual's account balances, and not about subsidies.I recently came across a resident who needed to use his PSEA funds for a course in an aeronautical university that has collaborations with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, the Air Force and Singapore Airlines.7.00 pmWith such extensive local industry partnerships, quality and industry relevance should be less of a concern. The resident was in the final year of his course, when his father, who sponsored his studies died suddenly. As his father had remarried, the funding for his studies was abruptly cut off after his death. His mother was of limited means. He had hoped that MOE would enable him to tap on the more than $3,000 balance in his PSEA to pay his remaining course fees, but this was turned down.Monies that are left unutilised in the PSEA when the account holder turns 31 will be transferred to his CPF Ordinary Account. MOE confirmed in January that over the past three years, about 90% of PSEA accounts had balances transferred to the CPF.Although the amount of the balances transferred appears modest, tapping on these sums to complete tertiary studies would be welcomed, especially for those less well-off. It seems a waste to channel the balances for housing and retirement when its primary purpose was post-Secondary education or the account holder is young. I hope MOE will at least look at case-by-case applications and appeals.Lifelong Learning for a Gig EconomyMr Png Eng Huat (Hougang): Sir, some of the workers in the gig economy today are former professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs). Some of them are mature workers who could not get back into the workforce after losing their jobs.In a survey reported in the Straits Times last November, nine in 10 full-time gig workers were looking for other jobs, and six in 10 were undergoing training or skills upgrading. Seven in 10 were worried about losing their gig jobs. Thus, the concerns of workers are relatively the same, whichever economy they are in.So, while we are advocating lifelong learning for our salaried workers to remain relevant in a changing world, we should do likewise for workers in the gig economy, in particular, the mature workers, so that they too, can have a decent shot at moving up the value chain while earning their keep as freelancers.I am particularly concerned about mature gig workers because ageism would have compounded their struggle to get back into a 9-to-5 routine. Staying in the gig economy could be their only option to make a living for a while. And the reality is, the longer they remain in the gig economy, the harder it will be for them to find a day job. So, having the right certifications may open doors to better paying gigs, which in turn, may help these mature workers find meaning in life in the gig economy.Recently, I came across a freelance trainer who wanted to upgrade himself to become a master trainer. But to get there, this person would need advance certification, and subsidies for those expensive courses are only made available for sponsored employees. That would mean that this person would need to work for a company or find a company that is willing to sponsor him. This resident is in his early 60s and was running a regional outfit before he was retrenched. What are the chances of him getting either one of the funding options?Since gig workers are on their own, can the Ministry look into introducing a surrogate scheme so that these mature workers in the gig economy can take up specialised courses under similar funding model that sponsored employees are currently given?Member of Parliament Mr Patrick Tay has made a call for the surrogate scheme to be brought back and I second that.SkillsFutureMr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio): Chairman, the SkillsFuture programme is a wonderful initiative which provides tangible support for Singaporeans to learn new skills at every stage of their life. When it was rolled out in 2016, many Singaporeans made good use of the opportunity to pick up new skills. The range of courses is impressive from languages to healthcare, culinary skills to information technology and more.I appreciate the $500 SkillsFuture Credit top-up for Singaporeans aged 25 and above and the additional one-off SkillsFuture Credit of $500 for every citizen aged 40 to 60. In the event that the COVID-19 outbreak deepens, there might be some workers laid off in the next few months. Would the Ministry consider allowing this group to utilise their SkillsFuture Credits earlier, before the commencement date of 1 October this year?Many employers, especially our SMEs, are busy dealing with the here-and-now and have limited bandwidth and time to plan for their future. However, rapid technological advancements and disruption require them to continually innovate and seize new opportunities. Their workers need to keep up with the changes too. So, training is very important. What measures or incentives does the Ministry have to help our employers develop stronger workplace training capabilities?One potential benefit from attending similar SkillsFuture training courses is networking among employees in the same industry. Such opportunities could be a chance for workers and staff from different SMEs to collaborate. They could share best practices or even form small working groups where they could brainstorm and exchange ideas. These are all developmental opportunities for workers too. Such collaborations could increase the chances of our SMEs moving up the value chain, to become more innovative and competitive. Does SkillsFuture have a role in assisting such companies and facilitating industry collaborations? If so, could MOE elaborate on this?Finally, it is important that courses and programmes associated with SkillsFuture meet high standards and live up to their accreditation. Otherwise, potential employers would have doubts about the training credentials of applicants and the programmes might eventually lose their value. We also want to ensure that the SkillsFuture Credits are used wisely. What measures does the Ministry have to ensure that the content and teaching standards of the courses are of a high standard and to prevent fraudulent use of SkillsFuture Credits?The Chairman: Mr Lim Biow Chuan.Bursaries for Higher EducationMr Lim Biow Chuan: Sir, in the recent Budget Statement, Finance Minister announced that there would be increase in the quantum for pre-universities bursaries, from $900 to $1,000. There will also be more transport subsidies and school meal subsidies. The bursaries for students in Polytechnics and Autonomous Universities would also be increased.I support this move by MOE. Providing good education to our students will help families break out of the poverty cycle and level out the inequality in society. The primary question is how to ensure that our students who can qualify to further their education are not deprived of doing so just because they lack the funds.May I ask the Minister, in the last three years, how many families have been helped under MOE's financial assistance schemes? Is the process for applying for financial assistance cumbersome? Are school teachers taught to look out for students in need of financial assistance? Has there been any feedback that students at that age may feel embarrassed to stretch out their hands for financial assistance?Once we identify those students who require financial help, will we also find out more about whether the families also require Public Assistance or ComCare?May I ask the Minister: how can MOE make the process of applying for financial help less embarrassing for the lower income students who are in need?The Chairman: Mr Leon Perera.Social Impact Bond (SIB) for RetrainingMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member): Sir, I have argued previously in this House for exploring social impact bonds (SIB) as policy tools to ensure that public spending achieves reasonably successful policy outcomes, reducing the risk of wasted public spending. SIBs, well implemented, enhance results-oriented public spending.By one estimate, as of July 2019, 132 SIBs have been launched in 25 countries raising more than $420 million in investment to address social challenges. A few SIBs have been launched in the UK and one in Columbia to target skills training towards those who are unemployed, vulnerable and not in education, employment or training.With this cut, I would like to suggest exploration of SIBs as a tool that could be used to direct training towards Singaporeans facing employability issues.National Internship FrameworkMr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied): Sir, at the moment the process of securing internship and apprenticeship positions is largely decentralised, relying primarily on either the hiring entity or a small number of private jobs clearing houses. Moreover, most programmes tend to focus on highly skilled disciplines, such as finance or technology. These two facts mean that the benefits of internship and apprenticeship training tend to accrue only to a select segment of the workforce. In particular, many beneficiaries of such programmes tend to be highly educated students or graduates majoring in STEM-related courses and who possesses the means to seek, identify and apply to such opportunities.There is substantial evidence that internship and apprenticeship not only contribute to enhanced knowledge transfer and more efficient production but can also play a role in reducing the extent of labour market polarisation, which is becoming a growing concern in Singapore. However, such systems tend to be more successful when operating within the rubric of a larger institutional framework. Such national level institutions help establish the standard roles behind each party's commitment, promote worker firm matching and encourages the movement of journeyman to other firms once they have completed their formal training.[Deputy Speaker (Mr Lim Biow Chuan) in the Chair]The Government has already started in this direction with the Asia-Ready Exposure Programme being introduced at this Budget. I would like to go further and advance the idea of a national internship framework that can be built off the MyCareers job portal.Importantly, by taking the lead in establishing such a nationally-recognised internship framework, it not only enables voluntary, progressive acquisition of certification for future PMETs, but also enables the Government to qualify an apprenticeship culture that opens up the substantial benefits of such experiences to a much wider range of candidates, such as non-academic pursuits like the culinary arts, music and sports, artisanal practices, such as furniture-making and other skilled crafts and professions that rely on experience and on job training rather than book smarts alone.This allowed the Government to be a stronger advocate for Singaporeans that have ambitions to contribute to that traditionally and deserved sectors of the economy that nevertheless are paths to meaningful middle-class secured jobs.Skills for Future WorkforceMr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, in the global competitiveness report by the World Economic Forum in 2019, Singapore is ranked third for skill-sets of the current workforce but 28th for the skill-sets of the future workforce. This is concerning, as this shows that there is still much to be done for our workforce to be future-ready. The gap could possibly be with the existing employed workforce whom might like to gain in-depth knowledge on new disciplines like data analytics, software engineering, cybersecurity, information security, process automation and more.In the latest future of job study by the World Economic Forum, employers surveyed estimated that by 2022, no less than 54% of all employees will require significant re-skilling and upskilling. Of this, 10% will require additional skills training of more than a year. We are starting to see that this will be a strategic concern for employers in the very near future.While we have IHLs who have already have in-depth curriculum available for skills in these new industries, what are the Ministry's plans to raise awareness of existing curriculum and to make these courses more accessible to companies and the workforce, and how can trade associations and chambers play a role in this?Train-and-Place ProgrammesDr Lim Wee Kiak: Sir, can I take my two cuts together?The Chairman: Yes.Dr Lim Wee Kiak: Mr Chairman, the Next Bound of SkillsFuture comes at an opportune moment. The forces of globalisation and technological advances are reshaping industries and jobs at an accelerating pace. And with new jobs emerging and requirements of existing jobs changing, there is an increasing need for Singaporeans to continue to re-skill and upgrade.I would like to applaud the SkillsFuture movement for supporting Singaporeans in their lifelong pursuit of skills mastery.I stand in support of the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package. This is a much-welcome initiative to support our 40 to 60-year-old workers to up-skill, transition to new careers and stay employed.Over the years, the Government has put in place many measures to ramp up career transition and re-skilling programmes. However, many of these programmes, such as Professional Conversion Programmes, Place-and-Train programme and sector specific re-skilling programmes require individuals to be employed first before they are able to access training. The placement requirement, which is helpful to secure jobs for individuals, may also limit the number who can benefit from training.Given the goal of doubling the number of job placements of workers in their 40s and 50s, I would like to suggest to the Ministry to consider complementing this approach with a Train-and-Place programme instead to more comprehensively support re-skilling and career transition of the workers.After-school Care for Primary SchoolsMy second cut on after-school care service for Primary schools. In Singapore where most families have both parents working and not everyone is fortunate to have their grandparents or domestic helper to look after the school-going children, the reliance on after-school care service becomes very important. This is especially so for low-income families where they are able to benefit from very good subsidies from the Government.The parents would prefer to send their children to a school-based after-school care service as they do not need to worry about transport between the school and the after-school care service. They are also reassured that the child would not only be given meals but there would also be nap-time, playtime and even time set aside for tuition as well as other meaningful learning activities.7.15 pmHowever, for parents, finding a place in the school-based after-school care service is not easy because many of the schools do not have sufficient capacity to cater for all. Hence, many school-based after-school care service have a long waiting list. Then, there are parents whose child may be under-performing and require special care for them to stay on course.Can the Minister give the House an update on what is the average wait-list for school-based after-school care service?I urge MOE to consider to increase the capacity of school-based after-school care service to catered for at least 50% of the Primary 1, Primary 2 and Primary 3 cohorts in each Primary school. Also, how is the Ministry supporting disadvantaged students in Primary schools through the school-based after-school care service and the UPLIFT programme?Career Transition for Mid-career WorkersMr Zainal Sapari: Chairman, I am supportive of the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package for locals in their 40s and 50s to help them stay employable. While a target has been set to double the annual job placement of those in their 40s and 50s to around 5,500 by 2025, what efforts are being taken to scale up career transition programmes for mid-career switchers?What will MOE be doing differently next, compared to current approaches that would make these career transition programmes for mid-career switchers to be more effective in helping these mature workers with job placement? If we do not do things differently by thinking differently, then most likely, we would get the same results and be unable to achieve the desired outcome of the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package.I think, for a start, I would like MOE to consider increasing the capacity of re-skilling programmes such as the Professional Conversion Programme under the Adapt and Grow initiative, career transition programmes delivered by Continuing Education and Training (CET) centres, and those offered by sector-specific programmes.In addition, while a lot of efforts have been taken to outreach to mid-career workers and professionals, many are unaware of the help they could receive. I would like to suggest to MOE to increase awareness of the help and support that could be provided to these mid-career workers.Mental Health EducationMs Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong): There is an increasing awareness about the need to monitor the mental health of our young and provide the necessary support that they may need as they navigate through life's challenges. I am happy that MOE has made many efforts to comprehensively look at ways to support the mental well-being of our students in schools, such as incorporating lessons on mental health in the curriculum, equipping teachers with mental health literacy, having counsellors in schools and promoting peer support programmes.Indeed, mental health is a multi-faceted issue that needs to be addressed through different approaches and platforms. I believe that it is important not just for schools, but also parents, peers and the community to play a role as well as make a concerted effort to create awareness and reduce the stigma. MOE, however, could play a critical role in coordinating upstream efforts. Can MOE share and elaborate about its efforts to help students who are in need of mental health support and how it intends to further develop mental health education in schools?Could MOE perhaps do more to leverage on social media, the youths' preferred mode of communication and work towards building an eco-system within which all stakeholders could work together to aid early detection, encourage students to seek help when needed and provide pervasive and holistic support in and outside school?Microaggressions in SchoolsProf Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member): Being called bodoh, stupid or 笨蛋 by your teacher, having your teacher throw your homework into the trash in full view of your classmates, seeing your name and wrong test answers flashed on the screen for the entire class to see, having your teacher tell you, loudly and harshly in front of everyone that you will never amount to anything, being screamed and yelled at for giving wrong or incomplete answers, enduring blame from your classmates for depriving everyone of your teacher's promised treat because you failed to score the minimum grade like everyone else.These are the aggressions and indignities some of our students suffer in school. These naming and shaming methods are harsh and destructive, sabotaging our ability to build positive and edifying learning environments. Such tactics humiliate and demoralise poor performers and also create a toxic and competitive environment where peer-to-peer support becomes collateral damage.I am confident that the majority of our teachers undertake their jobs with professionalism, care and dedication. Indeed, many are role models who go the extra mile for students in need, encouraging and inspiring our students. But I have received considerable feedback from parents and students that a minority do commit such aggressions that while seemingly minor, nevertheless, have considerable impact on our students' well-being and motivation to learn.Google commissioned a study to identify why some of their teams perform better than others. They found that a consistent feature of their most successful teams was the concept of \"psychological safety\". Psychological safety is the feeling that you will not be humiliated or jeered at for the ideas you propose, for asking questions or admitting to mistakes. When adopted in the classroom, students have no fear of looking stupid because the entire class knows that asking questions and making mistakes are vital to learning.When students do not enjoy psychological safety in school and worse, feel stressed and anxious in the presence of teachers who employ harsh classroom tactics, their ability and passion for learning will be extinguished. In light of our students coming in tops for fear of failure, psychological safety in our classrooms is something we must pay closer attention to and invest in.As I make this call, I can already hear the keyboard warriors lambasting me for helping to create a generation of strawberries. I have no doubt that I will attract such comments as, \"Attitudes like this will make our kids soft! If they are never scolded, they will never understand failure.\" I can only conclude that these individuals must have suffered aggressions themselves. Even in the working world, there is increasing recognition of the importance of psychological safety to improved performance and effective learning. What more the importance of psychological safety in our schools and classrooms?I believe that even these teachers who engage in petty aggressions are well-meaning. Their actions are symptomatic of the broader pressures that teachers themselves face in delivering results. Be that as it may, they must be made to realise that such disparaging treatment of students must be abhorred, that shaming and humiliation can exact a considerable toll on students' self-esteem, and will ultimately kill their interest in learning.As many of my fellow Members of Parliament have emphasised, issues around the mental health of young people are on the ascent. I had mentioned in my Adjournment Motion on the fear of failure, that we must make our schools feel like safe spaces in which to fail, and to try again. Hence, I would like to ask the Ministry what efforts have been made to equip our teachers for the socio-emotional aspects of teaching? Do the teacher preparation curricula in NIE's diploma programmes include such training and competency building?Finally, I reckon that these teachers who commit such aggressions are themselves under stress and pressure, and I wonder what support is provided to our teachers to engage in self-care to deal with the strains of their professional duties and performance targets. Parents have also shared that when they provide feedback on such aggressions to the school leadership, the teachers are excused for being \"old school\" and that their approach should thus be tolerated. Hence, I would like to ask what more we can do to educate our school principals on recognising the harms of such aggressions and how they can effectively intervene to manage such teachers?Let us strive to foster a positive learning environment to ignite the spark for learning, not just for school, but for life."

        "Content": "The Chairman: Head W, Ministry of Transport. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.Developments in Public Train TransportMr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir): Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum allocated for Head W of the Estimates be reduced by S$100\".Mr Chairman, in my kick-off speech for the Committee of Supply Debate for MOT, I would like to address two key developments in our transportation industry in Singapore. The first, a recent unanticipated development – the first, a recent unanticipated development, the COVID-19 outbreak and its effect on the industry; and the second, MOT's strategic long-term plan for our rail network.I start with the recent virus outbreak. As we know, Singapore has been under the cloud of the COVID-19 outbreak since the end of last year.We have been working extremely hard collectively to battle against the spread of the virus in Singapore. Our healthcare team rightfully deserves our admiration and gratitude for their efforts on the frontline, looking after patients who have fallen ill because of the virus.However, Sir, there is also another team that has been on the frontline, bravely continuing to provide essential services to Singaporeans amid the ongoing virus outbreak. I am referring to our public transport team.I joined Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary and NTWU Executive Secretary Brother Melvin Yong last month to visit the Bedok Integrated Transport Hub and Tanah Merah MRT Station and we observed our public transport team doing their part to step up cleaning routines which are over and above their usual duties. They work very hard every day, putting themselves on the line in the fight against the virus outbreak so as to ensure that precautionary measures are taken to protect Singaporeans on our public transport network.I wish to take this opportunity to salute them for their efforts!We also know that the virus outbreak has adversely affected the entire transportation industry. Travel numbers are down, whether in the air, on water or land. Transport operators and workers are concerned not only about bottom lines but also their own health as they go about their daily work.I am therefore extremely glad to see the various measures that the Government has put in place to support the transportation industry.To better protect our taxi and private hire car drivers from COVID-19, 300,000 surgical masks have been provided for them to offer to passengers who are unwell. Both taxi and private hire car operators have also set up temperature screening protocols for their drivers.The Point-to-Point Support Package totaling S$77 million dollars was announced to support our drivers whose livelihoods have been adversely affected by the virus outbreak. There are three components: the Special Relief Fund (SRF), the Government and NTUC Driver Care Fund for drivers and the Waiver of the Operator Licence Fee for Point-to-Point Transport Operators.Various other measures to support our aviation and marine transportation sectors were also announced at the Budget Statement earlier by Deputy Prime Minister Heng.These measures will go some way in alleviating the hardships and difficulties that the transportation industry is facing as a result of the virus outbreak.However, while we all hope that the virus outbreak can be contained quickly, in the past few weeks, we see worrying signs of further outbreaks in Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy. If this continues, or worse if more countries get affected, it will inevitably have a further adverse effect on Singapore’s globally inter-connected economy. We must therefore confront the possibility that the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus could continue for some time to come and further affect our transportation industry.In the premises, I would like to invite the Minister to share with us further plans or measures that MOT could implement to support the transportation industry, in the event that the situation is drawn out over a prolonged period of time.Sir, I move on now to our rail network. On this front, we have much better news to share.As we are all aware, the Government has made and are still making significant investments to our rail network. Minister Khaw Boon Wan had recently announced that the multi-year programme to renew the North-South and East-West lines, which are Singapore’s oldest and most heavily used lines, willcost more than S$2.5 billion dollars.The rapid expansion of our rail network continues over the next two decades. Announced projects include the Thomson-East Coast Line, Jurong Region Line, Circle Line extension and the Cross Island Line. Once the Cross Island Line is completed – currently scheduled for 2031 –Singapore will have doubled its rail network to 360 km.Our extensive efforts to renew, expand and improve our rail network has clearly paid off! I remember Minister Khaw, in 2017, setting a target of 1 million Mean Km Between Failure (MBKF) by 2020. This means that our trains, on average will travel about 1 million km before a delay of more than five minutes is recorded. We achieved this ambitious target by August 2019! Ahead of time.It was no mean feat. We will recollect that as recently as 2015, our rail reliability was at 133,000 MBKF, at about one-tenth of current reliability levels. In 2017, this number had increased to about 400,000 MBKF and finally, to current levels of above 1 million MBKF.The renewal of our rail network has led to higher reliability and shorter waiting times. The expansion of the rail network will lead to better accessibility, more convenience and comfort for commuters in the future. These are all positives and MOT should be lauded for achieving and indeed, surpassing, the herculean targets and tasks set.Sir, as an accountant, however, I also worry about the bottom line. Investments made in the renewal and expansion of our rail network need to be funded. The operatingcosts of maintaining rail reliability at current levels need to be sustainable. The large losses recorded by both SMRT Trains and SBS Transit reported in 2019 provides us with an insight of thecosts involved.Sir, I think that at the end of the day, for our public rail network, it is a fine balance between financial sustainability of the rail network, affordability for consumers and the reliability and efficiency of the trains.I therefore invite the Minister to share with us the Ministry’s long term strategic plans on sustaining and securing Singapore’s future public rail transportation needs as the Government continues to invest in expanding and renewing our rail network, while concurrently maintaining current reliability and service levels.Question proposed.Support for Airline WorkersMr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio): Mr Chairman, the aviation sector has been adversely affected by COVID-19. Many airlines and their crews are feeling the brunt because many flights have been cancelled and the passenger numbers for other flights have been reduced. I have been to the airport several times over the last two or three weeks. The situation is very tough – very few passengers. Consequently, even taxi drivers share with me that they wait for about three hours for passengers. That has never happened before in the past.The Government announced a slew of packages involving training and support assistance. I would like to ask how has our airlines and staff, including the ground crew and cabin crew, responded to the help? Has it cushioned the impact and whether measures such as sending workers for upskilling have been implemented and well-subscribed?I know we are asking for some things to be sped up in the midst of these recent announcements, but indeed, the income and the flight hours have been shortened tremendously; and the help needs to be very imminent and fast.Both local and foreign crew also operate as effective teams. We do not just need the Singapore crew. A lot of times, we need our foreign workers and our partners who fly and service the planes, and do all the necessary work at the airport. It is indeed critical that we retain and ready the core team for the upturn, following COVID-19. Are there concerns among workers in the sector that remain unresolved and what more can we do to cushion and mitigate the impact?COVID-19 and Point-to-point (P2P) DriversMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong): Chairman, I would like to declare my interest as the CEO of ComfortDelGro Taxi Business.COVID-19 hit Singapore suddenly and spread quite rapidly. We appreciate MOT's swift actions to announce plan to help our P2P drivers even before Budget day. Such move was greatly appreciated by the P2P drivers, because it is such a big improvement as compared to the time of SARS, when the help was given later.However, the Special Relief Fund (SRF) of $10 per day is really not enough. Taxi operators have provided a top-up, by providing rental rebate of up to $26.50 per day, over and above the SRF of $10 per day. By doing so, taxi operators are in the red but taxi drivers and P2P drivers are still suffering. Many P2P drivers met me at the coffeeshops, in the course of my work, to appeal to the Government to increase the quantum of SRF. Alternatively, LTA can help to provide tax rebates to P2P operators so that the operators can pass the savings to the P2P drivers.The Minister has openly said, many times, that the Government is willing to provide more help, as and when it is needed. Minister, the “when” is now.Transport Response to COVID-19The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs and National Development (Ms Sun Xueling): Mr Chairman, with tourist arrivals plummeting and an increasingly number of companies allowing their staff to work from home to reduce the risk of infection, cabbies have reported a drop in earnings of over 25%, while private hire drivers have seen a drop of over 30%.To address this, LTA announced a $77 million point-to-point package to help taxis and private hire businesses. The relief package gives about 40,000 eligible drivers $20 per day per vehicle for three months to ride through this difficult time.Some taxi drivers have shared with me that the assistance is not sufficient as the drop in their earnings have been substantial.I would like to understand the Ministry's thinking behind the relief package. Changes in ridership patterns could also be longer term in nature. What are the training packages available to help drivers move on into other sectors?10.15 amElderly Vocational Licence HoldersMr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied): I have been approached by a number of elderly residents who hold Taxi Driver's Vocational Licence (TDVL), highlighting the following two matters and requested that this be brought to Ministry's attention.First, the issue on the mandatory medical examination or health check-ups. It is a requirement for Qualified Driving Licence (QDL) holders aged 65 and above to go for health check once every three years for them to be allowed to continue driving. I also understand that for TDVL holders of the same age group, they are required to have their health checked on yearly basis.Based on these two requirements, an individual age 65 years old and above has to attend medical examination once every three years.Sir, it is understandable for TDVL holders in this age group to find it inconvenient to go through two separate medical examination within a year. First, they have to fork out additional amount of money for their health check, and second, it affects their income since they have to sacrifice their driving hours to attend this medical examination.I do hope the Ministry will consider to allow elderly TDVL holders to undergo a single comprehensive medical examination, instead of two separate sessions, as mentioned earlier.Second is the issue on the statutory age limit for vocational licence. Currently, the statutory age limit for vocational licence is 75 years old. I would like to convey a request to have the statutory age limit increased for another few more years, as long as the medical examination result permits. This extension will allow elderly TDVL holders who still need to sustain themselves to continue driving for few more years. And for those who just want to earn some income or remain active, they can do a part-time or relief driving. Hope Ministry will look into the matters raised.The Chairman: Mr Png Eng Huat, you can take both your cuts together.Making Pedestrian Crossings Safer for AllMr Png Eng Huat (Hougang): Thank you, Sir. The first cut. Sir, I have spoken about making signalised pedestrian crossings safer for all in 2013, 2015 and 2018. In particular, I have called for the discretionary right turn junction to be phased out.If one were to Google the term \"discretionary right turn\", a list of accidents will pop up on the screen. There is even a petition asking LTA to ban such junctions all together.LTA was reported to have taken steps to address the safety concern of pedestrians over the years. I have noticed that more traffic light junctions are being re-programmed. I spoke on the same subject time and again, because I strongly believe those horrible accidents that happened at such junction could be avoidable.Fast forward to 2020, 6 January, to be precise, a student, with the right-of-way and hidden by a vehicle waiting at the discretionary right injunction was sent flying through the air by another vehicle who did not see the young man crossing the road. That was the last straw for me. The discretionary turning on green rule is the recipe for accidents to happen because there are two green lights in operation at the same time: one for the vehicle to turn right and the other for the pedestrians to cross. How is that not dangerous to begin with? Imagine pedestrians and drivers hesitating at the discretionary right turn junction, second-guessing whether it is safe to proceed even though the lights are both in their favour.If a pedestrian could be assigned 15% blame in an accident, even though the lights were in his favour in the court of law, what is the proportion of blame for the Ministry for giving pedestrians a false sense of security a discretionary right turn, when the Green Man signal does not necessarily mean it is safe to cross any more?Sir, we all know that policies, rules and regulations cannot cover every situation. I am not asking the Ministry to design a perfect traffic junction. I am asking the Ministry to take the guess work out of crossing a simple junction. Anything else, the pedestrians and motorists will have to take responsibility for. And if we are talking about cultivating patience on the road, would a split traffic junction not been ideal training ground for that? You wait for your turn to proceed.Sir, I strongly urge the Ministry to do something about those discretionary right turn junctions wherever possible because the safety of pedestrian must be at the forefront of everything in a car-lite pedestrian-centric city.Rethinking Pedestrian Overhead BridgesSir, it was reported in the news that there are 553 pedestrian overhead bridges or POBs here in 2017. Last November, LTA announced that by 2022, 103 of them will be retrofitted with lifts. That is about 19% of all POBs that will have lift access by next year.Many Singaporeans welcome the idea of having lifts retrofitted to POBs, especially the elderly people with mobility issues, couples with baby on pram and anyone who finds climbing overhead bridges a challenge.I have written on behalf of many residents request for lifts for the overhead bridge in Hougang, in particular, the one at Holy Innocence High along Upper Serangoon Road. LTA has patiently replied to those residents, sharing about the highcost of retrofitting lifts to POBs and the priority being given to overhead bridges within 400 metres from polyclinics and hospitals.Retrofitting lifts to POBs is a challenging process in itself. Plots of land on both sides of the road would have to be acquired to make way for the lift shafts. The construction along the narrow stretch of the foot path is challenging and the whole process may take quite a while to complete. The lifts at the overhead bridge along Hougang Avenue 2 have been under construction for almost two years and they are still not ready.But having lift access for all which may not be an ideal solution for an ageing society like ours. If the lifts were to break down or to undergo servicing, everything would be reverted to leg power again. Sir, as we are transiting to a car-lite city, I hope the Ministry will shift the focus of our road and transport planning to be more pedestrian-centric. The rationale of having POBs to serve a car-lite and ageing society may need a rethink.I hope the Ministry can study into the possibility of converting those heavily used POBs in HDB heartlands to signalise pedestrian crossings. This will allow pedestrians with mobility issues or special needs to cross the road, come what may, even if the traffic lights are out of order.Maybe the Ministry can share what is thecost of implementing and maintaining a signalised pedestrian crossing versus retrofitting an existing overhead bridge with lifts. The issue of having too many signalised pedestrian crossings along a stretch of the road, can be easily overcome with synchronised traffic light control. And if we are talking about a pedestrian-centric and car-lite city, getting drivers to exercise a little patience would fit the overall objective quite nicely.Optimising Public Transport FairlyAssoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member): Sir, in order for our public bus system to break even, fares would have to double orcosts would have to be cut in half. Our MRT system is also facing an operatingcost deficit which will grow with new rail lines that may well redistribute existing passengers rather than grow new ridership.While the fare formula has added the network capacity factor to address rising operatingcost deficits,cost management is also important. Could the Ministry update us on efforts to optimise public transport services to managecosts?Some commuters will also be affected when service frequency and availability is optimised. This makes it hard for the public and hon Members to supportcost management. Could we consider \"win-win\" solutions where we issue targeted, transitional public transport vouchers to commuters who have to bear the brunt of any service changes?Air and Sea HubMr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang): Chairman, Singapore acts as a regional air and sea transport hub. We have managed to use Singapore's geographical location to our advantage, and over the years we have become a major regional and international hub through bold vision and thorough planning.The opening of Jewel at Changi Airport has definitely upped the attractiveness of Changi as regional air hub. We are also relocating our container terminal to Tuas. But our status as a regional air and sea hub cannot be taken for granted and there are many regional countries also eyeing the pie. As such, I would like MOT to give an update of the measures that we are taking to stay ahead of the pack and how we are also preparing our workforce in the air and maritime transport industry to keep up with the changes ahead.The Chairman: Mr Dennis Tan, you may take your three cuts.Piracy in the Strait of SingaporeMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member): Thank you, Mr Chairman. I declare my interest as a member of the shipping community in Singapore. Last month, I filed a Parliamentary Question (PQ) asking (a) whether any investigation is being carried out in respect to the piracy incidents in the Singapore Strait in and after December 2019; (b) has the Government identified the persons or groups responsible for the reported incidents and where they originated from; (c) what action has been taken by any of our Government agencies to date; and (d) what are the Government's plans to prevent similar acts of piracy?Minister Khaw Boon Wan replied that there were 12 incidents involving piracy and robbery in December 2019 and January 2020, and as none of those incidents happened in our territorial waters, no investigations were required of our agencies. He said that as the Singapore Strait does not only include Singapore territorial waters, the fight against piracy requires collaboration among all partners. According to him, the Republic of Singapore Navy conducts joint coordinated patrols with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand through the Malacca Straits Patrol (MSP) in the Strait of Singapore as well as in the Strait of Malacca; that the MSP hold regular meetings to enhance coordination, review conduct of operations and share intelligence and information.On a same sitting in February two hon Members in this House also filed questions relating to the piracy incidents to the Minister for Defence. Minister Ng Eng Hen in his reply to one Member talked about RSN's cooperation with neighbouring counterparts under the MSP.I had filed the PQ to the Minister for Transport instead of the Minister for Defence, as MOT is the domain Ministry for maritime transport, and in my view, this goes beyond the issue of security or security arrangements with our neighbouring countries. Minister Khaw's answer confirmed that no investigation was carried out by Singapore on the incidents reported and we are none the wiser about the cause of these piracy incidents – why there was a sudden spike in the number or who were the culprits behind the incidents?Minister Ng's answer also shed no light on the same. The port of Singapore is one of the busiest ports in the world. Many ships pass through the Strait of Singapore every day for which a large number comes through to the port of Singapore and is anchorages and even its Outside Port Limits (OPL) waters for a variety of commercial shipping, bunkering and ancillary activities. It does not matter to shipowners or uses that the Straits of Singapore is not entirely subsumed under our territorial waters.Many shipowners and users associate the Strait of Singapore with the access and passage between the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea and with access to the Port of Singapore and its OPL.It is therefore in the interest of MOT, MPA and indeed all stakeholders in the Port of Singapore and our maritime hub, that the Strait of Singapore and its adjacent waters are kept safe and free of piracy activities. In fact, in my view, it is in the greater interest of Singapore, as compared to our neighbours, that piracy activities are minimised or curbed.We have seen from the piracy problems off the coast of Somalia and the Gulf of Aden, not so long ago, and more recently off West Africa, how piracy result in increase in insurance and other operatingcosts for shipowners and operators, and shippingcosts for shippers. Many ships also avoided these waters. Well, the piracy situation in the Strait of Singapore and the Strait of Malacca is thankfully far better than what we have seen in the waters off Somalia or West Africa. This is something we should not take for granted.In July last year, the Chinese government raised the security level on Chinese flagged ships transiting the Strait of Malacca.I hope MOT and other Singapore Government agencies involved will work actively with our counterparts in neighbouring countries to (a) understand the causes of all piracy incidents regardless of the locality of each incident; and (b) help bring all culprits to justice or encourage neighbouring authorities to work towards that end.By doing the above, I hope all parties and all countries can work to minimise or curb piracy activities in the region.PMDs, PABs, Bicycles and Cycling PathsMOT announced in November 2019 that e-scooters will be banned from footpaths but will be allowed on cycling paths; and MOT will extend the network of cycling path from 440 km to 1,300 km by 2030.Last month, at the Second Reading of the Active Mobility (Amendment) Bill, I had some questions on the proposed extension of the cycling path network. But Senior Minister of State said that MOT will only be touching on the extended cycling power network during theCOSdebate today.I would like to ask again, whether as part of the extended cycling path network, cycling paths will be directly linked to every HDB block, condominium, private landed house, shop house, office building and industrial building, so that there is a direct access for e-scooters, other PMDs, e-bikes and bicycles from each of these type of building, without the rider having to alight and push these devices on footpaths at all.Direct access to the extended cycling lane network cannot be a half-hearted attempt, for example, having cycling paths circling a number of HDB blocks, but with no direct link from each block; or having cycling paths circling around clusters of private residential estates, expecting e-scooter or other users to alight and push en route to cycling paths. Similarly, people going to work in office buildings or industrial estates, must have direct access without having to travel on surfaces on which their mode of devices are barred.In fact, going one step further towards utopia, if our cycling path network were to become sufficiently extensive such that PMD riders do not need to alight and push. It may in turn do away with the need for cyclists to share the use of foot path, which is still currently allowed. And this prospect will be welcomed by many footpath users who may not think that sharing footpaths with cyclists is a safe idea at all. It is not a safe idea because we still have a riding culture problem.10.30 amOn the other hand, if the extensive linkage between cycling paths in our homes and offices seem too expensive, impractical or ambitious, then MOT may have to reconsider e-scooters, other PMDs and even e-bikes as a serious option for first and final mile connectivity.10.30 amIf there is no direct link between the extended cycling network and the homes or workplaces of Singaporeans, e-scooter users would technically have to alight and push their e-scooters when on roads or footpaths and e-bike users must push their e-bikes when passing through footpaths. How confident are we that all riders will comply accordingly?The new cycling lanes with a more extensive network alone will not solve all the problems we have seen with e-scooters before the footpath ban. Most of these problems, I submit, had to do with a poor riding culture, inadequate public education and inadequate enforcement.With the new mandatory competency test certification for all users, I hope the public education situation with riders will improve considerably. However, for the non-riding public, I hope the Government will take steps and review how it can improve its public education. The Government must think of how to push such information to people who do not seek it, and such efforts should be carried out in all our four official languages.On the issue of enforcement, people may take their chances and continue to use their devices illegally or in unlawful ways if they think that the chances of meeting enforcement officers are slim. Even now, I still see e-scooters being ridden on the road or on footpaths, albeit in a limited way. I still see illegal specs e-bikes being used and e-bikes on footpaths.May I ask the Minister, while we await the building of the extended cycling paths, what efforts will be taken to enhance enforcement as well as public education beyond the current efforts?I have also in the past suggested that the Government should consider mandatory safe riding certification courses with disqualification rights. The competency test certification process adopted last month is a big step forward. I believe that with disqualification rights, people will take greater care to use their e-scooters safely and considerately. So, I would again urge MOT to incorporate disqualification rights in our law.Delivery Riders on PMDs and PABsMy third cut. Last month, in response to my Parliamentary Question, MOT affirmed that under the Active Mobility (Amendment) and the Shared Mobility Enterprises (Control and Licensing) Acts, food delivery companies should be responsible for ensuring that their riders ride safely.The new Acts do not provide details on this. Will the Minister confirm that these regulations will be included in the subsidiary legislation?Meanwhile, I would also like to suggest that such regulations must include imposition of penalties on the food delivery companies in the event of any failure on the part of their riders to comply with the law, for example, pertaining to the use of devices with correct specifications, use of devices on paths allowed for the relevant devices, riding safely, and so on.It is important to ensure all food delivery companies will take ownership of the issue of their riders using lawful devices or riding lawfully and safely during their deliveries.On the very day the Government banned e-scooters from footpaths, Deliveroo announced that they would stop working with e-scooter delivery riders on footpaths. However, I continue to see GrabFood delivery riders using e-scooters on footpaths or roads even in the last two weeks. I am shocked that GrabFood still allow their delivery riders to carry out delivery in an unlawful manner and I hope that MOT will take action.Separately, in respect of the delivery companies’ obligations to ensure that their active mobility riders have third-party insurance, will MOT take steps to ensure that all third party liability insurers will not be able to exclude or repudiate policy liability for accidents which take place while the riders are in breach of the law? For example, PMDs being used on the road, rider using an illegal specs e-scooter or PAB rider using footpaths. I am concerned that if allowed, claims by injured parties may be frustrated when accidents take place in such scenarios, which may defeat the very purpose of requiring such insurance coverage, particularly when the rider is self-employed and own his own device.Expansion of Cycling PathsMr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang): Chairman, early this year, Senior Minister of State Lam Pin Min mentioned that the Government will spend more than $1 billion to accelerate the completion of the island-wide cycling network.While we have always mentioned that cycling is a good mode of transport for first and last mile connectivity and the focus has been to increase intra-town cycling network, can I also suggest that the MOT look at the possibility of cycling being a viable mode of transport for the entire journey?Singapore is a small island and cycling is a good form of exercise. For someone working within 10 km of their workplace, cycling could be a good alternative if there are good inter-town cycling paths.My hope is that it would be possible for my residents to cycle from Jurong West to Raffles Place on designated cycling paths in the future.The Chairman: Mr Ang Wei Neng, you can take both your cuts.Cycling PathsMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong): Chairman, I am glad that MOT is accelerating the construction of Singapore’s network of cycling paths by a few years. It was previously announced that the network would be expanded from the 440 km currently, to 750 km by 2025, and up to 1,300 km by 2030. Does it mean that we are really trying to accelerate? We hope that MOT will give a firmer update on the timeline? Does it mean that we are aiming to build 1,300 km of cycling paths five years earlier, that means by 2025?In determining exactly how the cycling paths should be laid out, to what extent does MOT consult with the local community? For instance, as cycling paths are typically carved out of existing footpaths for the more mature estates, who decides if the cycling paths are to be located on the left or right of the footpaths? Who decides the footpath were to be sandwiched between the cycling path and the road or the cycling path be sandwiched between the footpath and the road?Also, from past experiences, we encounter problems with mature trees blocking the potential new cycling path or shared path. How is MOT coordinating with the various Ministries to expedite the construction of these cycling paths?Operating Train Services OverseasChairman, my next cut is on Operating Train Services Overseas. This morning, there is a breakdown in the train service from Bishan to Yio Chu Kang, so that prompted me to change my speech. Let me declare my interest as part of the management team of ComfortDelGro before I continue my speech.Singapore's train system has surpassed 1 million train-km between delays of more than five minutes. It is not a small feat. I do not know whether this morning's breakdown, how will it affect the 1 million mark.However, nothing is perfect, just like when Police say Singapore has low crime, it does not mean there is no crime. When Singapore Airport is ranked the best airport in the world for a few years, it does not mean there is no lost luggage in Changi Airport.Likewise, it is unreasonable to expect the train system be perfect and no breakdown at all. It is more important to build resilience within the train system; and the Circle Line and Downtown line have added resilience and some redundancy with the train system.Similarly, the upcoming Thomson Eastern Line as well as Cross Island Line will build more resilience within the system. So, train passengers then can have alternatives when one line is down – like the London train system. To this end, I would like to ask the Minister when is a good time for LTA and Singapore train operators to join forces to bid for management of train services overseas?By operating train services overseas, it will enable us to learn the best practices first hand and also bring the best to Singapore. This will benefit our Singapore commuters.Train operators like Hong Kong's MTR has been operating overseas for quite some time. They have been operating 1,000 km of track in London, Stockholm and Australia. Similarly, French state-owned public transport company RATP operates in 14 countries and they have deep knowledge in how to operate the train system.At some point of time, I would like to ask the Minister when will the Singapore fraternity, the train fraternity, consider operating the train system overseas, share our expertise overseas and bring the best to Singapore?Renewal Plans for LRTsMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong: Mr Chairman, the Bukit Panjang LRT system, dogged by reliability issues, is now undergoing a $344 million overhaul that is due to be completed in 2024. Yet, we should not forget that parts of the Sengkang-Punggol LRT system (SPLRT) are also reaching a critical point in their lifespan where concerns on reliability may begin to surface.Indeed, both LRT lines were upgraded to two-car operations in 2016 and load on the systems would surely have increased. SPLRT did see some preventive maintenance and asset renewal works between 2017 and 2018. However, if past experience with the MRT system is any indication, should we expect that more works ought to be done to maintain and improve on the reliability numbers of the LRT system? I would like to ask the Minister when can the residents in both Sengkang and Punggol expect such renewal and overhaul works to happen?Rail Infrastructure RenewalMr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar): Mr Chairman, I am heartened to see that the efforts of our extensive multi-year, multi-billion dollars rail renewal projects are now bearing fruit. Reliability of Singapore’s overall rail network has continued to improve steadily, reaching an impressive 1.08 million MKBF in the first nine months of 2019.But as we applaud the good work done thus far, we must not become complacent, or else, we risk undoing all that we have managed to achieve thus far. I would like to ask the Ministry to provide an update on the respective on-going rail renewal projects.I would also like to ask if the Ministry has any plans to renew and refurbish our older MRT stations, in particular, along the North-South and East-West Lines, some of which were built more than 33 years ago.Rail maintenance workers are our unsung heroes in Singapore’s journey towards better rail reliability. They have been working hard day and night, including on weekends and public holidays, to carry out both maintenance and renewal works. Some have raised issues regarding the lack of sufficient lighting and ventilation when carrying out their work in the MRT tunnels. With an increasing network of tracks underground, it is important that we take care of the welfare of our workers.I have been into the tunnels on several occasions to observe track renewal as well as tunnel cleaning work. Rail maintenance is back-breaking work, and I hope that the Ministry can look at improving the work conditions for our rail workers.Public Transport Access for Tuas SouthMr Arasu Duraisamy (Nominated Member): Chairman, I would like to declare my interest as the General Secretary of Singapore Port Workers Union.The development of Tuas South is picking up pace. Sembcorp Marine shifted its HQ to Tuas in 2019, bringing along a large number of its workforce from other parts of Singapore office as they consolidated operations in Tuas.PSA Tuas Mega Port will start operations next year. While the initial workforce numbers remain small, it will grow over time as more container berths become operational over the coming years.In my engagement with workers and union leaders, one of the main concerns was the distance between home and work. Based on SMRT's website, a commuter will take around 90 minutes to commute between Pasir Ris and Tuas Link, and approximately 72 minutes he stays up-north from Yishun to Tuas Link. The complete journey does not factor in another half hour of travelling time to his actual workplace along Tuas Boulevard. This worker will be spending a minimum of 15 to 16 hours per day just for work and travel, assuming he is on a 12-hour shift roster.Together with the sectoral tripartite partners, interim transport solutions have been put in place to cater to the workers' travelling needs. It is just a temporary solution and not a permanent solution.At last year's Committee of Supply debate, I proposed to MOT to consider an MRT line down-south to reduce travelling time and the idea was dismissed due to projected low ridership. Can MOT reconsider the proposal for an automated people mover system in light of workforce growth in Tuas South?Can the Minister also share what would the projected ridership numbers be for Tuas South in five and 10 years' time? What are the long-term transport plans for Tuas South and how does MOT intend to address workers' concern on reducing their commuting time, especially for those staying in the eastern part of Singapore?Public TransportMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten): Sir, the 2019 poll on public transport showed that satisfaction with rail reliability has improved substantially as compared to a few years ago. Most commuters who take the MRT will notice that there have been marked improvements in train capacity, train reliability and comfort.As a regular MRT commuter, let me thank the Transport Minister and the team at MOT and all the people who have helped make improvements to the rail network system.10.45 pmAs we continue to push for a car-lite society, may I urge MOT to consider having more public bus services to shuttle private estate residents to and from their homes to MRT stations during peak hours. Currently, whenever I request for a bus service, the usual response from LTA is that there are adequate options. But if adequate options means to walk a distance in the hot sun or rainy weather to the bus stop, then most residents will stick to driving their cars to their office.Hence, I urge MOT to make an extra effort to make public transport more convenient for residents. Offer them a shuttle bus service to bring them to the nearest MRT station. If that extra effort is not made, it is unlikely that we will be able to persuade the residents to give up the comfort and convenience of their cars to walk a longer distance in the hot sun or rainy weather, just to take public transport. Make it so convenient that it is a no-brainer to take public transport as compared to their private cars.Next, may I ask Minister for an update as to the completion date for the eastern sector of the Thomson East Coast Line (TEL). I have four stations in my constituency and many of my residents are very excited about having a new train line near their homes. Is it possible that completion of the TEL may take place earlier than 2023?Reducing Cross Island Line (CRL) Impact on WildlifeMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): Sir, there is no doubt that the Cross Island Line is needed and I also have no doubt that we can reduce its impact on our biodiversity. People are concerned that the clearance and construction work at worksite A1W1 will have a major impact in breaking up wildlife habitats.It would mean that tree-dwelling animals like the Raffles' Banded Langurs might not be able to get from one forest patch to another and this will threaten their survival. There are only 61 Raffles' Banded Langurs left in Singapore. The stakes are extremely high. These highly threatened monkeys are only found in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. This is one of their last strongholds. If the forest is cleared for the worksite, the Langurs who rely on tree canopies will be forced to come down to the ground to use the roads to cross and they will likely get injured or killed.We know through the work of Dr Andie Ang that a bachelor group of four male Langurs – Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello and Raphael – need the forest at the worksite A1W1. While mitigation measures have been proposed, Dr Andie feels that these measures will not work. She personally told me that she fears for the survival of this species.Will MOT consider moving worksite A1W1 further into Singapore Island Country Club (SICC) where the forest that the Langurs need will not be impacted?EngineersMiss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines): Sir, I am heartened to note that the rail reliability has improved in 2019. The overall MRT Mean Km Between Failure (MKBF) was over 1 million km from October 2018 to September 2019. MOT has successfully achieved bold target of 1 million km between failure, as set by Minister Khaw in 2017. Our trains are now as reliable as the Taipei Metro and Hong Kong MTR. I applaud the team for their resilience, determination and hard work in achieving the target.Beyond ensuring timely renewal and maintenance of assets, we also need to build a pool of ever ready and competent rail engineering and maintenance crew to cope with a rapidly expanding rail network.Can the Minister share details of the training and upskilling programmes available for rail engineers? How have these programmes led to the recent improvement in rail reliability and whether these programmes would be further enhanced?The Chairman: Mr Melvin Yong, you can take your three cuts together.Rail Manpower Development PackageMr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar): Chairman, our rail network will grow significantly over this new decade. The addition of three new lines – the Thomson-East Coast Line, Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line – will increase the length of our rail network by about 130 km, bringing the total network length to about 360 km in 2030.As our rail industry grow, we need to upskill existing workers and recruit more rail professionals to run the expanded and more complex train network. The $100 million Rail Manpower Development Package, announced by Minister in November 2019, will help accelerate this transformation of our rail workforce.Can the Ministry provide an update on the initiatives under the Rail Manpower Development Package? Additionally, how many workers are expected to benefit from these initiatives?Electric and Autonomous VehiclesChairman, my next cut will focus on the future of our land transport system, which will be electric, connected and autonomous.First, I applaud the Government for its ambition to phase out Internal Combustion Engine vehicles by 2040 and to embrace Electric Vehicles (EVs). Can the Ministry provide an update on the growth of EVs in Singapore over the past five years?Fleet vehicles, such as our public buses, will be key in driving critical mass for islandwide EV-adoption. Does the Ministry have plans to replace all public buses with electric buses and what will be the timeline? Will our island's charging infrastructure be sufficient for the mass adoption of EVs?Sir, the future land transport system will also be autonomous. Could the Ministry provide an update on the various Autonomous Vehicle trials and whether the plan to pilot autonomous buses in Punggol, Tengah and the Jurong Innovation District in the early 2020s is still on track?Bus Contracting ModelChairman, my final cut will be on the Bus Contracting Model (BCM). The introduction of BCM in 2016 has indeed transformed our public bus industry to become more competitive. Today, we have four public bus operators operating 14 bus packages. Commuters are enjoying better service reliability and reduced wait times, resulting in bus ridership hitting an all-time high of over four million daily rides in 2018.I would like to ask the Ministry for an update on how the BCM has benefited the public bus industry, in terms of bus captain wages, quality of service and commuter satisfaction.But as I highlighted in last year's Committee of Supply debate, BCM is not without its drawbacks. Bus captains have informed me that their jobs today, are now more stressful than ever, as they have to meet new stringent KPIs imposed. Could the Ministry share how it intends to mitigate this additional stress faced by our frontline bus captains?Additionally, I would like to ask if the Ministry has learnt any lessons from the tendering of the first four BCM packages and if there will be any changes to the future tenders.Lastly, I would like for the Ministry to update on their plans to enhance our public bus infrastructure to keep up with the increase in our public bus fleets and to cater for the introduction of electric buses.Green VehiclesMr Ang Wei Neng: Chairman, the push by the Government to phase out the internal combustion engine vehicles in Singapore by 2040 is a very ambitious plan. This means that more than 600,000 diesel and petrol vehicles today will be replaced by full electric vehicles or other green vehicles in 20 years' time unless the Government is thinking of shrinking the vehicle population very drastically.Before I proceed, I will like to declare my interest as the CEO of ComfortDelGro Taxi business. I have explicitly supported the plan to roll out more clean and green vehicles last week in the Parliament. However, I will like to make a few clarifications today.Firstly, how is the Government going to realise the plan of increasing the charging points from the current 1,600 points to 28,000 points in 2030? What kind of incentives will Government provide for real estate owners, car park owners or operators or new players to install more new charging points?Today, we have about 1,125 electric vehicles (EVs) supported by 1,600 charging points. Come 2030, how many EVs can be supported by 28,000 charging points? If most of the EVs are charging at about the same time, say in the evening, do we need to upgrade our Power Grid?The current Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES) allows fleet owner to enjoy up to $30,000 of rebate off the Additional Registration Fee (ARF) but the EV Early Adoption Incentive (EEAI) is only capped at $20,000 rebate off the ARF. In short, EEAI alone is not as attractive as VES. Does MOT have plan to continue with VES next year so as to supplement and compliment the EEAI?We will like to seek clarity so that fleet owners can better support Government's green initiative.Charging Infrastructure for Electric VehiclesThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs and National Development (Ms Sun Xueling): Mr Chairman, one of the biggest challenges to EV ownership currently is the network of public EV Chargers. SP Group has committed to operate a public charging network with 1,000 charging points by 2020. Other providers include Greenlots and some car dealers.Private property owners can install a wall box which are charging units, especially installed by the dealer at the electric vehicle owners' place of choice. However, the vast majority of consumers live in high-rise buildings. Greenlots, for instance, is installing charging stations at a small number of Condominiums and requires MCST approvals to do so.I would like to inquire, what is the Ministry's roll-out plan to get from 1,600 electric charging points now to 28,000 by 2030. What potentially are some of the bottlenecks and what is the plan contingent on? How does the Ministry envision building charging points in public places and for private property owners?Connectivity to MalaysiaMiss Cheng Li Hui: Sir, the bilateral agreements on the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail the Singapore-Johor Bahru RTS projects were signed in 2016 and 2018 respectively. When ready, the RTS link will allow 60,000 additional commuters to cross the Causeway during peak hour. The project benefits both countries by easing causeway congestion, reducing travelling time and facilitating business and tourism.On 4 November 2019, it was announced that a suspension of the RTS project will be extended until 30 April 2020.With a new government in Malaysia and the April deadline approaching, can the Minister provide an update on our bilateral transport projects. What is the status of RTS? Will progress commenced after April? If there is no progress, what other options are there to improve connectivity between the two countries and improving the Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) facilities at our border.The Chairman: Minister Khaw Boon Wan.The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan): Thank you, Chairman. Sir, my Ministry has prepared a simple folder, may I ask permission for the Clerks to distribute some of them.The Chairman: Yes, please. [Handouts were distributed to hon Members.]Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Mr Chairman, COVID-19 is still wreaking havoc around the world. In Singapore, Changi Airport took the first hit. Airlines have cancelled over 20% of their scheduled flights. Passenger volume at Changi has plunged by 25% and is likely to fall further. Both the cruise and ferry sectors are devastated. As China locks down, global supply chains are also disrupted. As fear grips, people telecommute more and go out less. Along with reduced tourist arrivals, our bus, rail, taxi and private hire car riderships have fallen by about 20%. This has taken a toll on the livelihoods of our taxi and private hire car drivers.We are also tracking the impact on our transport infrastructure projects. For now, the delay to project timelines is still manageable. But if the outbreak drags on, it could disrupt the supply of construction equipment and materials. This could impact the timeline for Terminal 5, Tuas Port, new MRT stations and the next-generation ERP system. For example, our new trains are being built in China.With support from our tripartite partners, the Government reacted swiftly with a robust Unity Budget 2020.For the transport sector, MOT worked closely with NTUC and our transport operators to put in place relief measures to support our workers, while providing assurance to our commuters. Let me join Mr Sitoh Yih Pin to thank all frontline transport workers for keeping Singapore moving amidst this outbreak.The COVID-19 outbreak will burn out. Sooner or later, our economy and our industries will recover. While we attend to the immediate needs, we should also focus on the eventual recovery and make full use of this lull period.First, position our companies and workers to ride the eventual upturn. Use this opportunity to transform and grow. We have the road maps, the air, land and sea transport Industry Transformation Maps, to show us the way forward. Let us carry them out.Second, press on with our infrastructure plans. Over the next five years, we have an extensive line-up of construction projects in the transport sector.On the aviation front, we are expanding Changi Airport. The third runway will be operational by the middle of 2020s. The development of Terminal 5 is well underway.11.00 amOn the maritime front, Tuas Port Phase 1 will be fully operational by 2027. When fully completed in the 2040s, Tuas Port will be the world’s single largest fully-automated container terminal. Together, these investments will grow our external connectivity to seize growth in the global transport of goods and people.Another international link is the proposed RTS Link with Malaysia. Miss Cheng Li Hui asked about the progress. The project remains suspended until the end of April this year. Recent political developments in Malaysia will further impact the project. While we remain committed to working with Malaysia to find a way forward, the project cannot be suspended indefinitely. We, therefore, look forward to hearing from Malaysia soon. Are there other options to address the Causeway jam? Expanding the immigration facilities will help as the current capacity is inadequate to handle the peak traffic. Better distribution of traffic between the Causeway and the Second Link will also help. Likewise, a better distribution of traffic between peak and off-peak periods. We have been trying to pursue all these options, but to move the needle meaningfully, the RTS Link is the answer.On the domestic land transport side, we stand ready to speed up over $100 million worth of cycling path and road construction projects by up to three years.But beyond the immediate, our vision is a clean and green transport system for Singapore. This will raise the quality of life for generations of Singaporeans to come. We will make three strategic moves.First, phase out vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE) by 2040. In other words, no more ICE vehicles by 2040! We have 20 years to phase them out. Senior Minister of State Dr Janil Puthucheary will explain how we can achieve this and replace them with cleaner vehicles.Second, speed up the construction of our cycling infrastructure. Senior Minister of State Dr Lam Pin Min will explain how we can get more Singaporeans to Walk-Cycle-Ride for first-mile and last-mile connectivity.Third, keep our public transport among the best in the world. As noted by Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, Miss Cheng Li Hui, Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Lim Biow Chuan, we have turned the corner on rail reliability. So, let me join these Members to thank our transport workers – LTA, SMRT, SBST and the National Transport Workers’ Union – for their hard work and dedication. But remember, maintenance is a continuous effort. Never lift your eyes off the ball. And, certainly, never be complacent. Let me also thank our commuters for their patience and understanding. But remember, a highly reliable MRT line may still experience some occasional hiccups. We do our best to reduce such inconveniences to the absolute minimum.I note Mr Ang Wei Neng’s suggestion that our rail operators should seek to venture abroad, as our bus operators have done. This is something for the operators to decide. But if they do, my advice is that their foreign ventures should not distract them from their domestic operations in Singapore. Their priority must always be to ensure safe, smooth and reliable journeys for our commuters in Singapore.In any case, our two rail operators will be fully engaged with our domestic network. There is plenty of work to be done. Over the next decade, we will be spending over $60 billion to expand and renew our rail network – $60,000 million of works to be done. Let me elaborate in response to Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Dennis Tan.First, we will be completing the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL). Stage 1 has already opened. Stage 2 will follow within the next few months – single digit months. Mr Lim Biow Chuan and his residents in Mountbatten will benefit from Stage 4 of TEL by 2023. Can we expedite further? \"Jing kang kor\" – I think very difficult. First, it is a very complex project. Every time I meet the team, my message to them is \"safety first\". Do not be hasty. Deadlines are there to meet. Certainly, you want it done as soon as possible. But never compromise on safety.Second, we will be completing the extensions to the North East Line and Downtown Line by 2023 and 2024 respectively – within the next term of Government. We will see four new stations added to our rail network. This includes the opening of Hume Station by 2025, which Mayor Low Yen Ling has actively lobbied for in previousCOS. This year, I did not find her \"cut\".Third, we will be completing the Circle Line when we complete the circle. This final stretch at Keppel is the most challenging to build and also the mostcostly. But when completed in 2025, it will significantly raise the resilience of our MRT network and the travelling experience of our commuters.Fourth, we will be completing the Jurong Region Line by 2028. Like Mr Arasu Duraisamy, we want our Tuas port workers to have good public transport to Tuas. JRL will benefit them. This is in addition to the Tuas West Extension and bus services 247 and 248 in the Tuas South area which we had put in over the past few years.Fifth, we will be completing Phase 1 of the Cross Island Line by 2029. This will contribute towards the subsequent growth of our rail network to 360 km from the current 230 km. In fact, a Singaporean student studying in Geneva, Faiz Basha, was so excited by the plan for our rail network that he produced a revised MRT map for 2030 and beyond. Mr Cedric Foo referred me to this map. He was intrigued by it and he described it as a beautiful map and, indeed, it is. Senior Minister of State Dr Janil Puthucheary told me of another Singaporean, architect Cliff Tan, based in the UK who has offered LTA many similar design suggestions. Both are overseas but their hearts are firmly anchored in Singapore!Indeed, by 2030, around 80% of Singaporeans will live within walking distance of a train station. We would have achieved or exceeded the level of train connectivity enjoyed by the residents in Hong Kong, Tokyo and New York today. As Mr Cedric Foo remarked to me about our plan: “This is our commitment to build a liveable city in Singapore and this is MOT’s contribution to reducing traffic jams as well as carbon emissions!”Apart from expanding our rail network, we will finally complete the renewal of the North-South Line and East-West Lines (NSEWL) by around 2023. Actually, 2023 is not too far off. This year is 2020; so, in only two to three years' time, Mr Lim! By then, we would also be able to see the benefits from the renewal of our oldest LRT line, the Bukit Panjang LRT. Ageing train stations, too, will be suitably refurbished and upgraded, especially the toilets and escalators. In time, we will also need to renew the next oldest lines – North East Line and Sengkang Punggol LRT – in good time.The hard lesson learnt from the problems earlier faced by SMRT is that we must invest in good operations and maintenance. As noted by Miss Cheng Li Hui, this means engineering capabilities, as well as the timely renewal of old MRT and LRT lines. There is no free lunch.As we pursue these projects, let me assure Mr Melvin Yong that we will continue to work with operators and unions to ensure optimal working conditions for our transport workers. Mr Yong knows that these are my top concerns. Every time I visit a depot, I would check in, talk to them, take a good look at their lounge, the furniture, the toilets. Those are signs whether the operators are paying attention.They form the backbone of our transport system. We must support them well so that they can perform to their maximum potential.Mr Chairman, transport is both capital-intensive and skills-intensive. That is why MOT’s budget is among the biggest in the Government. I think we are at number four this year although, in terms of the number of \"cuts\", we are at the bottom four, I think. I think it says something.To ensure sustainability, we need taxpayers and commuters to co-fund it. The question is how to share the burden fairly. As posed by Mr Sitoh Yih Pin just now, it is how to strike a balance between financial sustainability, affordability, reliability and efficiency. It requires hard-headed calculations and a heavy dose of empathy. It requires political honesty and also sound judgement. That is why, among other things, we have a process comprising an objective fare formula and an independent Public Transport Council.I agree with Assoc Prof Walter Theseira that fare adjustments must be accompanied by seriouscost containment. We will continue to look forcost-cutting measures and productivity improvement solutions. We will also regularly benchmark our operators’costs with their counterparts elsewhere. A recent NTU study gave us some reassurance that our operators’costs are well within normal range. But we must also have the discipline to deploy public transport services prudently. That is why we have to sometimes turn down Members’ requests for new bus services – shuttle service, maybe we can negotiate – or shorter headways.In the coming years, the expansion of rail and cycling lane infrastructure will add greater connectivity to the system and benefit more commuters. A highly interconnected transport network, supported by real-time information, will provide commuters with more route and mode options. Good mobile apps will empower commuters to choose the option that best meets their needs. As travel patterns change, we must be nimble to optimise the provision of public transport services. Assoc Prof Walter Theseira raised the idea of a transitional voucher for commuters affected by such optimisation. I am not so sure if it is easy to design such a scheme. But in a way, our cheaper off-peak rates are one such idea. In any case, we always ensure that commuters affected will have reasonable travel alternatives so that they will not be left in the lurch, and our Members do understand the need forcost management.One such considerate Member is Mr Lim Biow Chuan. I have heard his request for additional public bus service for his private estate residents. LTA will evaluate his request seriously, carefully and fairly. We do have shuttle rides. I live in a private estate where there is a shuttle bus going around. In fact, it was the first private estate shuttle that runs on electricity – electric bus.Mr Chairman, over the years, we have progressively transformed our land transport sector to better serve Singaporeans. It has not been a smooth journey but we never let difficulties discourage us. Mr Ang Wei Neng referred to McKinsey’s 2018 report ranking Singapore’s public transport as amongst the best in the world. More recently, there was a Business Insider France (11 February 2020) report on urban mobility, in which consulting firm Oliver Wyman joined forces with the Berkeley University of California to rank the top 10 advanced cities in the world based on the quality of their public transport systems. Singapore came out top. Credit must go to successive generations of MOT and LTA officials who put their heart and soul into this venture. But we know we are far from perfect. We still have a lot of things to do, including to complete the $60 billion strategic long-term plan for our rail network which I have outlined earlier and I look forward to Members’ continuing support.My other MOT colleagues will now elaborate on our other plans moving forward.11.15 amThe Chairman: Dr Lam Pin Min.The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min): Mr Chairman, Minister Khaw spoke about the impact of COVID-19 on our transport network and our strategies for eventual recovery. He also laid down the vision of a clean and green transport system in Singapore. I will now elaborate on our efforts in the aviation and maritime sectors, and share how we can develop our cycling infrastructure to complement our vision for a clean and green transport network.COVID-19 has hurt the aviation and maritime sectors. Passenger traffic at Changi Airport and cruise and ferry passenger numbers have declined significantly. Our priority for the coming months is clear: first, help industry tide over this difficult time; and second, position for recovery so that we emerge from this even stronger.First, we will help the aviation and maritime sectors tide over this difficult time. On top of economy-wide measures, we have rolled out a $112 million assistance package to help the aviation sector defraycost and ease cashflow pressures. For the maritime sector, we have provided a 50% port dues concession to passenger vessels, on top of all existing concessions. We will also provide targeted assistance to affected ferry operators and other enterprises located at Marina South Pier and West Coast Pier.We are also helping companies reduce theircosts so that they can help Singaporeans keep their jobs and use this time to go for training. Take, for example, airline crew, which Mr Ang Hin Kee asked about. Due to the adverse impact of COVID-19, the SIA Group has temporarily suspended more than 9,000 flights, or nearly 15% of all its scheduled flights from February to end of May. Notwithstanding this, SIA is committed to helping its crew keep their jobs.The Government is supporting this, through rebates on landing and parking charges, waivers of regulatory fees and the Jobs Support Scheme. These measures will help ease the financial pressure and support the retention of local employees. Early this week, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), Workforce Singapore (WSG), the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and NTUC announced an enhanced training funding and support package for air transport companies; we will work with airlines to facilitate their staff, including cabin crew, to attend training courses and will monitor the take-up rate.We are watching the situation very closely and stand ready to do more if the situation worsens. Our commitment to our aviation and maritime sectors is this: we will get through this together. Working together as SGUnited, we can overcome COVID-19.Second, we will work with industry to position for recovery so that we emerge from this even stronger. Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked how we can keep our air and sea hubs competitive. To stay competitive, we will invest in the three Cs – Capacity, Capability and Connectivity – and at the same time, develop sustainability as our new priority.Current challenges notwithstanding, air passenger numbers are expected to double from four billion to eight billion globally in the next 20 years; one in two of this growth, or 50% of this growth will be in Asia. For the maritime sector, the growth outlook is likewise positive. These translate to huge demand for capacity, capability and connectivity and offer tremendous opportunities for Singapore. But how do we respond to this?First, on capacity, we will press on with the development of Changi Terminal 5 and Tuas Port so that we are in time with new infrastructural capacity to meet future demand. We are not done building our air and sea hubs. Our efforts will not be hampered by COVID-19.Second, on capability. We cannot meet the new demand just by growing manpower; we need to leverage technology and raise productivity. We will help companies transform and capture new opportunities.Take, for example, CAAS will extend the $280 million Aviation Development Fund for another five years, from 2020 to 2025. Since 2015, the Fund has already helped nearly 80 organisations raise productivity through over 200 initiatives. Real value-add per worker has increased by over 7% between 2015 and 2018. One such initiative is SATS' smart glasses. It uses augmented reality technology to track the real-time location of baggage and cargo units and helps workers cut loading time.The Maritime Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and IMDA have also launched the Digital Acceleration Index to help maritime companies self-evaluate their digital maturity. MPA and the Singapore Shipping Association will take this a step further to launch the Maritime Innovation Playbook to help companies develop their digitalisation plans. Companies can also tap on MPA's Maritime Cluster Fund and the Sea Transport Industry Digitalisation Plan to support their digitalisation efforts.We will also equip workers with new skills to take on new and better jobs. We will train up a younger generation of Singaporeans so that they can benefit and grow with the air and sea industries. Come April, together with ITE, we will launch two new Work-Study Diploma courses in Airport Operations and Maritime Business Management respectively.Third, on connectivity. While demand may be down now, we will continue to maintain connectivity so that we can bounce back quickly when recovery returns. We will continue to push for air services liberalisation, to strengthen existing connections to cities and to build new ones. We will also go beyond physical connectivity to build digital connectivity. MPA's digitalPORT@SG™ will streamline digital port clearance processes for ships calling at Singapore and improve the efficiency of vessel calls. Likewise, digitalOCEANS™ will link us up to other maritime-related digital platforms globally to improve efficiency in the global supply chain.The safety and security of our sea-lanes is fundamental to maritime connectivity. Mr Dennis Tan asked what more we can do to address piracy and armed robbery incidents in the Strait of Singapore.I would like to reassure the House that our maritime security agencies, the RSN and PCG, will deal with any suspicious vessel entering Singapore waters robustly and take actions against perpetrators of crimes conducted.However, as the Strait of Singapore does not only include Singapore territorial waters, the fight against piracy and armed robbery requires strong collaboration among all regional partners and Singapore cannot tackle it alone.This is why there is the Malacca Straits Patrol (MSP) involving our military and the militaries of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. The MSP includes air and sea patrols in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. And as the Minister for Defence had shared with the House during MINDEF'sCOSdebates on Monday, MINDEF has reached out to its counterparts in Malaysia and Indonesia to propose that MSP be extended to other areas in our surrounding waters. Discussions are on-going. The RSN's Maritime Security Task Force will also be enhancing their capabilities to deal with maritime threats.Other actions are also taken to combat piracy and armed-robbery. MPA advises commercial vessels to stay vigilant, keep a lookout for pirates and take anti-piracy measures, such as holding training drills. Singapore is also part of a region-wide initiative called ReCAAP (Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy & Armed Robbery against ships in Asia), which facilitates timely and accurate information sharing so that the respective littoral States and the shipping community can take prompt remedial actions.While we position ourselves to seize the growth opportunities in aviation and maritime, we will do so sustainably. Singapore will not just be a competitive international transport hub but also a sustainable one. Let me lay out some of our strategies.On the aviation front, we will play our part to contribute towards the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO)'s aspirational goals of 2% annual fuel efficiency improvement and carbon neutral growth from 2020 onwards.First, Singapore is ready to participate in the voluntary phase of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) that starts next year. Under the scheme, our airlines will freeze their carbon footprint at current levels by reducing emissions and purchasing carbon credits.Second, Singapore's aviation community will work together towards greener aviation. Singapore Airlines has invested in the latest aircraft models that are more fuel efficient and has an average fleet age that is nearly half that of the industry. CAAS, our Air Navigation Service Provider, will continue to invest in new technologies and air traffic management processes to improve flow and cut delays. In 2019, these processes reduced about 130,000 tonnes of carbon emissions. Changi Airport Group will continue to invest in environmental sustainability initiatives, such as energy-efficient cooling systems, infrastructure for charging electric vehicles and renewable energy options.Third, we will study the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) in Singapore. SAFs can reduce emissions by up to 80% over their life cycle compared to conventional jet fuel, but they are two to five times more expensive today. Singapore houses key global aerospace companies and fuel producers, such as Rolls Royce, Shell and Neste. The Government and the industry players are studying different business and technological models to enable economically viable and sustainable SAF supply chains in Singapore.On the maritime front, Singapore is committed to environmentally sustainable international shipping under the leadership of the International Maritime Organization (IMO).On 1 January 2020, Singapore, together with the rest of the world, implemented the IMO 2020 regulation that reduces the permitted sulphur content in the fuels used by vessels from 3.5% to 0.5% outside designated Emission Control Areas. Beyond this, the IMO has set a longer term target to reduce the total annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by international shipping by at least 50% by 2050, from 2008 levels.Singapore will play our part under IMO2050. While IMO2050 is still 30 years away, we will start making plans now so that our companies and workers are equipped to seize new opportunities that arise from the shift. I am happy to announce today three new initiatives to position Singapore for the long-term maritime sustainability.First, MPA will launch the Maritime Singapore Decarbonisation Blueprint 2050 next year. The blueprint will chart out strategies to achieve a sustainable maritime Singapore and establish Singapore as a responsible hub port and international maritime centre.Second, the Singapore Maritime Foundation will set up an International Advisory Panel to garner inputs from local and international leaders from the industry and academia for this effort. The panel will convene for the first time in April this year.And third, MPA and its partners will set aside $40 million under the Maritime GreenFuture Fund to be used for the research, test-bedding and adoption of low-carbon technologies.Mr Chairman, this is what we do to help our aviation and maritime sectors compete, always looking beyond the horizon, planning for the long term, working in close partnership with workers and companies, and this will distinguish Singapore from other competing cities.Our land transport system also plays an important role in securing a sustainable future for Singaporeans.11.30 amWe will continue to work towards our car-lite vision and promote public, shared and active modes of transport as they are the most environmentally sustainable. I will touch on our efforts to promote active mobility, which has a low environmental footprint and complements our public transport system in moving towards a car-lite Singapore.In cultivating a sustainable active mobility landscape, we have enhanced our regulatory and enforcement regimes. With the recent ban on e-scooters on footpaths and enhanced regulatory regime on active mobility devices, path safety has improved.As Mr Dennis Tan said, businesses have a role to play, which is why LTA has introduced regulations on companies and continues to work closely with companies to encourage responsible behaviour by their riders. One requirement is that companies must ensure that all riders they hire in the course of work have third party liability insurance. LTA will specify minimum requirements for these insurance policies.Mr Dennis Tan also pointed out the importance of public education and enforcement. That is why we are introducing a mandatory theory test for all e-scooter and power-assisted bicycle (PAB) riders to educate and raise awareness. We have also enhanced the penalties to strengthen deterrence against offences like speeding and reckless riding. LTA will not hesitate to take errant riders to task. Regarding Mr Dennis Tan's suggestion to disqualify riders who commit serious offences from riding, we will work with the Active Mobility Advisory Panel (AMAP) to study if it is necessary to do so, depending on the safety situation going forward.Several Members have asked about our infrastructure plans. They will be pleased to know that we are accelerating the development of cycling paths. We have previously announced that there would be 750 km of cycling paths by 2025. We will bring this milestone forward by two years, reaching 800 km of cycling paths by 2023, which is not that far away – about three years away. The Government plans to invest over $1 billion as part of the Islandwide Cycling Network (ICN) programme to bring the cycling path network closer to Singaporeans' doorsteps.By 2023, all HDB towns will have cycling paths. All HDB residents will have direct access to a wider cycling path network that is almost double the existing network. Residents can look forward to the cycling path plans for their towns within the year. LTA is working closely with Government agencies and local communities to ensure that the cycling path network meets the needs of the residents.Towns which currently lack cycling paths or have many active mobility device users will have cycling paths built first. For towns with cycling path networks, we will continue to enhance connectivity, so that residents can enjoy more seamless access to key transport nodes and amenities like the town centre, MRT stations, eateries and malls.And as Mr Ang Wei Neng has highlighted, constructing cycling paths in mature towns require trade-offs, especially in densely built-up mature towns. In some cases, we may have no choice but to reclaim grass verges and affect trees. In others, we may need to re-purpose roads.By 2026, Singapore's cycling path network will be expanded to 1,000 km. With this, eight in 10 HDB residents will be a few minutes away from the cycling path network. Most HDB residents will be within 250 m from the nearest cycling path. This cycling path density is comparable to cities such as Amsterdam or Copenhagen. HDB Residents can expect to reach their nearest town centre within 20 minutes using active mobility modes.By 2030, we would have trebled the cycling path network to 1,320 km.Singaporeans will benefit from a comprehensive cycling path network connecting all HDB towns. The expanded cycling path network will allow more inter-town journeys to be carried out entirely on cycling paths. Active mobility device users can look forward to a safer and more seamless riding experience, with fewer interruptions. In addition, residents in Queenstown, Geylang, Jurong West, Sembawang, Yishun and Ang Mo Kio can rely on the Queenstown-City and Geylang-City routes, the Round Island Route, and North-South Corridor for journeys from their homes to the city before 2030.With these developments, more journeys can be carried out entirely on the cycling path network, as Mr Yee Chia Hsing has pointed out.Lastly, we need to develop the right culture of graciousness. This is critical in densely populated Singapore, where users of different modes of transport are constantly in close proximity.The Active Mobility Advisory Panel (AMAP) will continue to promote greater acceptance of active mobility in Singapore by focusing more on engagement and educational measures, and calling on all path users to be safe and considerate.Going forward, how can we do better, together? I would like to suggest a simple way, which is to look out for each other.On roads, motorists should practice good road safety habits and be vigilant and look out for other road users. On paths, device users should watch out for other path users and ride safely and considerately. Pedestrians should also be alert to their surroundings and keep to the left unless overtaking. They should walk on footpaths wherever they are, located adjacent to cycling paths.We will also continue to monitor the environmental impact of our other land transport projects.Take, for instance, the Cross Island Line. We have engaged stakeholders extensively since 2013 and will continue to do so even as the project enters the Advanced Engineering Studies phase. Concerning the proposed worksite near the Singapore Island Country Club (SICC) that Mr Louis Ng mentioned, LTA is committed to exploring how the worksite's footprint can be optimised and is in discussions with SICC to make use of its non-playing areas.Mr Chairman, we will stay resilient in this challenging period of COVID-19 and together, we will weather this storm. As Mr Yee Chia Hsing said, we did not become a major international aviation and maritime hub by chance, but through having a bold vision and thorough planning. We will continue to invest for the future, and sow the seeds for sustainable and competitive transport sectors. I will now hand over to Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary, who will explain our strategies for a sustainable land transport system.The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary): Mr Chairman, several Members have asked questions or provided suggestions that I will address in my response.Mr Ang Wei Neng, Ms Sun Xueling, Mr Melvin Yong and Miss Cheng Li Hui have brought up issues such as COVID-19, taxi and private hire car (PHC) drivers, the transition to the Bus Contracting Model, the push for electric vehicles and the necessary incentives and infrastructure. They have also asked about our plans for autonomous vehicles and the future professional development of our transport workforce. I hope to address their questions.COVID-19 has affected the public transport and point-to-point sectors. Compared to about a month ago, ridership on our MRT, our public buses and point-to-point transport sector has fallen by around 20%. The taxi and PHC drivers' livelihoods have been badly affected. They need help so that they can continue to provide sustainable services for Singaporean commuters.Together with the operators and the driver associations, we launched a $77 million Point-to-Point Support Package last month. This will help to partially defray businesscosts incurred by about 40,000 eligible drivers. Taxi operators such as ComfortDelGro, SMRT, TransCab and Premier have committed to further help and will lean forward to provide additional rental rebates to their drivers, on top of matching Government's contributions to the package. This brings the total support committed by Government and operators to over $90 million over three months.Eligible drivers have started receiving rental rebates or cash grants of up to $36.50 per day. Drivers who do not meet the eligibility criteria can seek help via the Government-NTUC Driver Care Fund. We hope that this will help the drivers through this difficult period.But COVID-19 could have a longer term impact, so we are working closely with the operators and the driver associations to monitor the situation. If necessary, we will consider further support.Even as we deal with COVID-19's immediate impact, we must push on with our plans for a future-ready land transport system. The Land Transport Masterplan 2040 (LTMP 2040) sets out this long-term vision that we have for our land transport system. It was developed in consultation with over 7,000 Singaporeans. And many participants recognised that Singapore is running up against tighter land, manpower, fiscal and environmental constraints. Long-term sustainability has to be a key planning consideration for our transport system.There are three critical strategies for us to achieve this long-term sustainability of our land transport system.First, we have to make Walk-Cycle-Ride (WCR) the preferred modes of transport here in Singapore. Walking – connecting us to the transport nodes, to the MRT, to the buses, and also to the amenities. Cycling – for those who can, as a very efficient and healthy way of getting around town. And riding – whether it is the MRT, the bus or shared vehicles, in preference to private car ownership.The second key strategy is to move comprehensively to cleaner and greener vehicles – dealing with the emissions, dealing with resource utilisation and the issues around carbon.Thirdly, we have to optimise our land transport system for the future. Every little bit of marginal gain – whether it is safety, whether it is efficiency, whether it iscost, whether it is the experience of the commuters – is important; and the best way to do so is to appropriately and correctly use technology to optimise our land transport system.First strategy on making Walk-Cycle-Ride the preferred modes of transport.It is sustainable, and Minister Khaw spoke about our ambitions for a world-class public transport network, our investments over the next decade to renew and expand the rail network. Senior Minister of State Dr Lam Pin Min spoke about how cycling and active mobility can play an appropriate role in this landscape.Buses will also play an important role. Today, they already connect millions of Singaporeans to their homes, their schools and their offices on a daily basis.The Public Transport Council's annual Public Transport Customer Satisfaction Survey (PTCSS) shows that commuter satisfaction in our public bus services continues to be high. The Bus Contracting Model (BCM) played an important part in achieving this. We have injected additional capacity through the BCM for more than 100 bus services. We have also built, replaced or upgraded 16 bus interchanges island-wide to keep pace with this larger bus fleet. Peak-hour bus waiting times for trunk services have come down from 20 minutes or less in 2016 to 15 minutes or less today. These improvements would not have been possible without the hard work, the dedication and the commitment of our bus captains.The BCM was a major change for our bus industry and tripartite partners worked closely together to ensure a smooth transition. In particular, the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU) played a key role in the development of tripartite guidelines to protect the welfare of bus sector employees and our bus captains. Bus operators competing for contracts under the BCM have to abide by these guidelines, which ensure that bus employees will be treated fairly and will be no worse off when a new operator takes on a contract.Through this close partnership with NTWU, we have seen improvements to the working conditions for bus captains, such as upgraded staff canteens and more rest areas. The starting monthly pay for new local bus captains has also increased by over 25% since 2014, higher than the national wage growth of 18% over the same period. All of these would not have been possible without the NTWU's leadership and active participation, and we very much appreciate their contribution to this effort.Our second strategy – to encourage cleaner and greener vehicles. It appears self-evident and has been discussed at great length in other parts of this Committee of Supply (COS) and also in the debate on the Budget. It is important and it is vital as we continue to grow our land transport system.As mentioned in Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat's Budget speech, all vehicles will run on cleaner energy by 2040. This means that after 2030, we should see no new purchases of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Today, we have close to 900,000 ICE vehicles, and this will require an extensive transformation of the fleet, significant changes in commuting and consumer behaviour, and development of the necessary supporting infrastructure to achieve this vision.11.45 amToday, Electric Vehicles (EVs) are the most promising cleaner vehicle technology. Car manufacturers are developing new models that are energy efficient and increasinglycost effective. Other technologies such as the hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, could be viable in the future, but today they are currently less suited for mainstream use. We in Singapore lack a supply of green hydrogen to power hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. So, if we choose that path there will be a highercost associated with the technology, infrastructure and refuelling. Nevertheless, we will continue to monitor developments and we will move in a way towards this vision for 2040 that will allow us to adapt to other technologies in the future.It is an ambitious undertaking and there are serious challenges that we will need to overcome. The Government will make four moves to achieve this vision.First, we will ensure that there is enough charging infrastructure accessible to EV owners. It will not be easy, but this is very important. Because if you are considering purchasing an EV over an ICE vehicle, you have to be convinced that you have access to a charger which is as convenient as access to a petrol station.As a first step, we will prioritise the charging provision at carparks, starting with public carparks.We will also work with the private sector to improve charging provisions at private carparks. We encourage charging providers to partner private developers and building owners, as many of them are keen to increase the availability of EV charging on their premises.Greater EV adoption will result in an increase in electricity demand and we will be able to manage this because we will build new power generation capacity and we will reinforce our grid network. We will also incorporate innovations such as smart charging and energy storage solutions that store energy from the grid during off-peak periods. We are conducting studies to better understand the different factors that affect the demand for charging and we will also study potential solutions. This will guide our planned roll-out of the infrastructure needed.The second move that we will make is to incentivise demand for EVs. Today, the upfrontcost of EVs is about 78% higher than equivalent ICE vehicles. It is a largecost gap for a prospective EV owner. EV sales accounted for less than 0.1% of all new private car sales over the last five years. Today, we have about 1,000 EV cars.This is why Deputy Prime Minister announced the EV Early Adoption Incentive at Budget this year. With this, the upfrontcost difference between an EV and an equivalent ICE vehicle will be narrowed by up to $20,000. With further adoption and new models, thiscost gap will close further. We expect EVs to reachcost parity with ICE vehicles by the mid 2020s. In the meantime, we hope that this incentive will serve as an early signal to encourage more prospective car owners to consider EVs. We also hope that car dealers will be encouraged to bring in more EV models. This will provide more choice for consumers and cater to the increase in demand.Taxi companies will benefit from this incentive. Mass market EV taxi models will only need to pay the minimum Additional Registration Fee of $5,000. As fleets like taxis stand to benefit more from the lower per milecost of EVs, we hope this incentivises more taxi companies to expand their electric taxi fleet. I am happy to hear that SMRT Taxis has already indicated their intention to trial more electric taxis in the near term.Although existing EV owners are not eligible for the EV Early Adoption Incentive, they will benefit from the technical revision to the variable component of their road tax from 1 January 2021 onwards. As a special transitional arrangement, we will exempt them from the additional flat component of the new EV road tax that was introduced at this year’s Budget. This component was introduced to partly account for the loss in fuel excise duties that EVs do not incur. It will be waived for a three-year period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023 for all EVs registered before this period.So, in future, going forward there will be an incentive for new purchasers of EVs. And owners of existing EVs, prior to 1 January 2021, will all see a reduction in road tax during this period.The third move is that the Government will take the lead to green our fleets. Last year, I shared that all public buses and taxis will run on cleaner energy by 2040. We will go a step further: all new public bus purchases from now on will be cleaner energy buses, including electric or hybrid buses.Since last March, we have deployed 50 diesel hybrid buses on the roads. We have also bought 60 fully electric buses and will be deploying them progressively this year. New bus depots will be designed to support electric buses. As we gradually replace our existing diesel buses with cleaner energy ones, Singaporeans will enjoy quieter commutes and cleaner air.The fourth move is that we will update our regulations to keep pace with technology. As one example, we will allow high-powered e-motorcycles into Singapore from 1 April 2020. This is in addition to the low-powered e-motorcycles which are already allowed today, and will add to the cleaner vehicle options available. Motorcyclists can now do their part for the environment by choosing an electric model.We will also approve CHAdeMO; it is a fast charging method for EVs, an optional EV public charging standard. This means that public charging points in Singapore can include these CHAdeMO chargers from today onwards. Prospective car owners will then be able to choose from a wider range of EV models, including those that use these CHAdeMO chargers.We will continue to review and refresh our regulations on EVs to ensure that these keep pace with industry developments.To recap, four moves to drive the strategy of EV adoption in Singapore: build up charging infrastructure, incentivise the purchase of EV vehicles, Government will take the lead with our fleet and updating our regulations.For our third strategy – harnessing technology to optimise land transport for the future. We have always relied on new technology to improve our transport system and deliver better transport outcomes. There are examples such as how today, you can plan your journey by looking up bus arrival times through the MyTransport app. Commuters can sign up for SimplyGo, allowing you to pay for public transport using your contactless bank card, so you no longer have to top-up your stored value cards.A further use of technology is Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). These have the potential to improve connectivity by more efficiently offering dynamically-routed forms of shared transport.Our AV trials have come a long way since one-north was designated as the first site for AV public road testing in 2015. Today, about 30 AVs are authorised for public road trials in a testbed that has expanded to include areas such as the National University of Singapore and Jurong Island. These trials have allowed developers to enhance their technology through real-world applications, and helped LTA learn how to safely introduce AVs to improve our transport network.The trials have also created opportunities for the public to interact with AV technology. Around 6,000 visitors tried out the on-demand driverless shuttles in Sentosa last year. The feedback was positive, with most visitors indicating that they enjoyed the ride, mostly because for them it is really no different from a usual bus ride.We aim to progress to the next stage of trials with pilot deployment in the early 2020s. We have launched a Call-For-Collaboration last year and there has been keen interest from more than 20 companies. We are currently assessing and looking through their proposals. Safety and public acceptance will continue to be top priorities as we progress to pilot the deployment in other areas.These are exciting developments. But even as we continue to study and adopt new technologies, we have to ensure that this benefits our people through better jobs.AVs will transform the transport sector and create new jobs. Today, some of our public transport operators have already taken steps to familiarise our bus captains with AV bus operations. So, these bus captains then become confident of working with AV technologies in the future.To further prepare our bus captains for AV buses, LTA will work with stakeholders such as NTWU and Public Transport Operators (PTOs) to develop a skills and training roadmap to be launched by the end of this year. This will identify emerging skills and new job roles arising from AV deployment. On-the-job training and courses on AV safety protocol and operations will also be developed. We plan to train about 100 bus captains as a start.These efforts are part of the Land Transport Industry Transformation Map 2.0. The Government will continue to work closely with the unions and industry to prepare our workers for new job opportunities in the sector.Another initiative borne out of this close tripartite relationship is the Rail Manpower Development Package (RMDP). The RMDP aims to expand the rail workforce and accelerate workforce transformation over the next five years. A key component of this is a set of incentives for rail operators to expand and accelerate their training in key technologies and skillsets such as data analytics and condition-based maintenance. We expect the first batch of workers to start training in these areas from the second quarter of this year, with over 3,000 expected to benefit over five years. RMDP will also attract, retain and raise the profile of rail professionals through the launch of new SGRail Industry Scholarships and Sponsorships. These will be open to fresh graduates and in-service staff to pursue further studies at Institutes of Higher Learning. By investing in our rail workers, we are also investing in the future of rail reliability.Beyond bus and rail workers, we will also continue to provide retraining and upskilling opportunities for taxi and PHC drivers, including allowing them to move laterally into adjacent sectors. The taxi and PHC operators have worked closely with the driver associations, with support from SkillsFuture Singapore, to develop training programmes for the drivers. For example, as of the end of 2019, about 4,600 ComfortDelGro taxi drivers have completed the SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace training programme, learning new skills to use e-payment technologies. Earlier this year, Grab and National Private Hire Vehicle Association (NPHVA) also launched the Grab Driver-Partner Training Kit that includes courses on safety and digital skills. Over the next three months, drivers can also benefit from the Self-employed Persons (SEPs) Training Support Scheme, which the Minister for Manpower had announced in this House earlier.We will continue to work with operators and unions to equip our land transport workforce with the necessary skills and capabilities for the next phase of development.So, Mr Chairman, we have three major strategies today to move towards the land transport system of the future. We emphasise \"Walk-Cycle-Ride\" to deliver on the vision that we have for a 45-minute city and 20-minute towns. We want the system to be clean and green, and for every part of the system to be optimised through the use of technology and across all of these strategies, throughout all of our efforts, we have to keep our focus on making sure that there are good jobs, that we look after the workers and we provide them the opportunities to retrain and re-skill themselves, to take advantage of these new opportunities.There is a lot of work ahead of us to achieve all of this. We invite Singaporeans to partner us on this journey. Together, we can build a sustainable land transport system that brings Singapore together, one which future generations of Singaporeans will enjoy and feel proud of.The Chairman: Mr Baey Yam Keng.The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng): Mr Chairman, the COVID-19 situation over the past weeks has reminded us of the importance of safety and inclusivity in Singapore’s transport system. During this difficult period, it is even more important that we ensure that no one is left behind, especially the elderly and vulnerable.In fact, safety and inclusivity have been priorities for transport, way before COVID-19 outbreak. Over the last five years, we have invested about $200 million on various safety and inclusivity-related transport initiatives. Let me highlight a few.In 2018, we announced plans to implement the Red-Amber-Green (RAG) arrows at all feasible traffic junctions to replace discretionary right turns and improve pedestrian safety. Mr Png Eng Huat will be pleased to know that we have implemented these RAG arrows at more than 300 junctions and target to have the arrows at a total of 1,200 junctions by 2023.We continue to strive towards a \"Vision Zero\" environment with fewer land transport-related fatalities, through regulations at the vehicle, driver and operator levels. This includes stringent medical examinations for drivers. Not only will this give confidence to commuters, this is also for the drivers' own safety.Mr Muhamad Faisal Manap asked about streamlining the medical examinations for elderly taxi drivers. As shared in the House last week, by the end of this year, elderly taxi drivers who have passed the medical examinations for their Taxi Driver Vocational License (TDVL) can use them to renew their Class 3 personal driving licences.12.00 pmOn the statutory age limit, we need to bear in mind that taxi driving is physically and mentally demanding, and can have serious impact on commuters and other road users. This move will bring greater convenience to our elderly taxi drivers. It is important to ensure that vocation drivers are fit to drive as they perform a public service. However, we are aware that with improve healthcare, drivers may be able to drive longer. We are studying the possibility of raising the statutory age limits of our elderly vocation drivers together with the Singapore Medical Association.Mr Png Eng Huat also asked about Pedestrian Overhead Bridges (POBs). Indeed, our preference is to build crossings at-grade, rather than POBs, as they are all barrier-free and can be more easily accessed by the elderly and people with mobility challenges. However, there are instances where such at-grade crossings are dangerous, for example across major roads with fast-moving traffic, or when they may cause serious traffic congestion. In such cases, we will provide POBs. Even then, we will do our best to meet the needs of our elderly and the less ambulant. We plan to install lifts at all new POBs near major transport hubs and other existing POBs, if possible. As these lifts arecostly, priority is given to the POBs which will most benefit the less mobile.Since March 2015, we have gradually introduced priority queues at transport nodes, so that individuals with special needs can board buses and trains more easily. Building on this effort, we will also start trialling the use of priority cabins on the North East Line trains towards the end of this year. Commuters in these cabins, which will be located near station lifts where possible, are encouraged to give way to the more vulnerable commuters, such as the elderly, wheelchair users and families with young children. The idea for this initiative came from the various public engagements done to better understand commuters' needs. So, thank you for the suggestion.As Singaporeans' mobility needs change, our transport system also needs to keep pace. Where suitable, the Government will continue to make our transport system even safer and more inclusive.To enhance road safety for senior pedestrians, we have introduced 17 Silver Zones since 2014 with 18 currently in progress. These zones have narrower roads, speed humps to reduce traffic speed and two-stage crossings for senior pedestrians to pause and rest, making road crossing safer for them.Over the past six years, accidents involving the elderly have reduced by almost 80% within these Silver Zones. With these encouraging results, we will continue with our plans to build a total of 50 Silver Zones island-wide by 2023. We are also constantly looking to improve upon existing results, for example, we will be trying lower speed limits at specific Silver Zones in the coming months to enhance road safety for our senior pedestrians.To help the visually impaired navigate through our transport system, we piloted the mobile application, Mobility Assistance for the Visually Impaired and Selected Users (MAVIS). The app was piloted on selected buses since January 2019. MAVIS alerts bus drivers when commuters with special needs are boarding and alighting and allows visually impaired commuters to activate an audio announcement at the boarding bus-stop to guide them to their arriving bus. This might not mean a lot to able-bodied commuters, but to the visually impaired, these functions help them get around more conveniently and safely. We have received heart-felt feedback from commuters on how MAVIS had made a difference in their lives, giving them more confidence to take the bus, especially when there is no one around to help.I am happy to share that towards the end of this year, we will expand the MAVIS trial progressively to all the buses on services 139 and 141, which serve the Enabling Village and the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped. Members would have also read about LTA's upcoming hands-free ticketing trial, which supports our effort to make it even more convenient for commuters with special needs to travel on our buses and trains, without the need to tap their fare cards.Mr Chairman, the Government's efforts alone are not enough to make our land transport system safe and inclusive. For example, even if we build more lifts at existing train stations, it will not help vulnerable commuters if others compete to use the lifts.Commuters play a very important role too. We will continue to encourage individual commuters to be more understanding about those with different needs from ours, be more gracious in putting others' needs before ours, and even better, be more caring by going the extra mile for fellow commuters, especially the elderly and those with special needs.Let me share this story on how some commuters have done so. Mr Lester Wong was on the train when an elderly woman fell with her groceries and could not get up. Lester went out of his way to accompany her home, to make sure that the elderly was alright. Upon reaching home and taking a rest, the elderly was still not feeling well, so Lester insisted on sending her to the hospital to make sure that she got the medical care and attention she needed. Lester was the winner of the first Caring Commuter award last year.Over the past years, we have heard many stories like Lester's and there are probably many more that we do not know of. We can harness these individual acts of care into a national movement and build a culture where showing care for fellow commuters becomes a way of life.Hence, to galvanise commuters and other key stakeholders into action, the Public Transport Council has set up a new Caring SG Commuters Committee to help grow this movement:Firstly, the Committee will help to facilitate greater awareness of the challenges faced by commuters and show commuters how to care for others. It is not always easy to know what kind of help others need, or if and when we should even offer help. Sometimes, we feel quite \"paiseh\"! This is why one of the Committee's first goals is to help commuters better understand other commuters' needs. We will encourage commuters who need help to ask for help too, so that it is easier for their fellow commuters to step up and provide the necessary care.Secondly, the Committee will engage commuters and other stakeholders to explore ways we can grow the caring commuting movement further, as part of the broader SG Together movement. Over the next six months, the Committee will organise two series of engagements. To begin, we will engage widely to gather ideas and views on how we, as commuters, can contribute to this cause. Then, we will engage commuters in targeted ways to pilot and co-create solutions that can help to grow the movement.The Committee will submit a report to the Minister for Transport in a year's time on its findings and recommendations on how we can continue to work with commuters and other stakeholders to build and sustain a caring commuting culture in Singapore.Mr Chairman, the industry will also need to lean forward to play their part in making our land transport system safer and more inclusive for all Singaporeans. There may be some initiatives that are difficult for the Government to mandate and implement alone. An example would be the provision of child seats in taxis. This was discussed extensively during our public consultations for the P2P regulatory review and had mixed views from drivers, operators and the public. Today, I am pleased to announce that SMRT will be leaning forward to pilot the provision of booster seats in all its taxis, at no additional charge to commuters. This will enhance safety for children in taxis and provide parents of young children with a safer transport option.Over the past weeks, we have seen even more instances of the industry stepping up to partner the Government, coming together during these difficult times.For example, Grab and Gojek have rallied their drivers to step up in this time of crisis to provide on-demand transport services for our healthcare professionals. This had helped to provide peace of mind for the frontliners of our battle against COVID-19, to know that they can have a much needed, more comfortable ride home after a stressful day at work caring for fellow Singaporeans.While COVID-19 would eventually run its course, the partnerships forged during this difficult time cannot end. We will continue to strengthen these ties and forge new partnerships as we build a transport system that is safer and more inclusive for all Singaporeans.Such partnerships are pivotal in the next phase of Singapore's development. The Government cannot and should not do this alone. We will need to tap on synergies across sectors and harness the strength of our entire community. As a whole, we are greater than the sum of our individual parts. Working closely together with commuters, the industry and the community, we will achieve our vision of a safe and inclusive transport system for all.The Chairman: Clarifications. Mr Ang Hin Kee.Mr Ang Hin Kee: Chairman, I have a clarification for the Senior Minister of State Lam.Beyond monitoring the take-up rate of training for aviation crew. I know that the Senior Minister of State takes a personal interest in many transport workers. I would like to invite the Senior Minister of State, together with SSG, WSG and CAAS to have a dialogue and attend a training class. Hopefully, the class can start within the month so that we can get a sense of whether the $112 million support to the aviation sector is reaching the workers and what has the workers' response been.I believe the training programmes are available. We have a Skills Framework and the Industry Transformation Map. So, delivering training to the workers should be something that the training bodies and the various partners can deliver. And I would like to invite the Senior Minister of State to do that visit soon.Dr Lam Pin Min: I would like to thank Mr Ang for that supplementary question. And I understand that he is equally concerned about the welfare of the workers.The announcement of this enhanced training and support package was just made less than a week ago, on Monday. As I am aware, it is already quite well-received on the ground. Definitely, we will be working with SSG, e2i, WSG, CAAS and NTUC to see how we can jump-start some of these training courses for the air transport industry, especially the cabin crew that Mr Ang Hin Kee asked about in his cut.I would also like to update Mr Ang that the SIA Group, for example, will be taking up around 6,000 training places under this enhanced training and support package. And we understand that this package will benefit up to 8,000 air transport workers. And SIA Group also planned to schedule the crew for training, hopefully from April onwards, taking into consideration things like the network and rostering requirements. But rest assured, I will be happy to accept the invitation by Mr Ang Hin Kee to visit them once you are ready.The Chairman: Mr Dennis Tan.Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong: Chairman, I thank Minister Khaw, Senior Minister of State Lam and Senior Minister of State Janil for answering some of the questions I have raised. I have a clarification for Senior Minister of State Janil.In my Budget debate speech, I raised the issue of the Government's handling of the foreign internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles issue in Singapore. I also had some suggestions. I would like to just ask Senior Minister of State Janil: at this moment, how does the Government intend to handle the issue of foreign ICE vehicles in Singapore?I am saying this because I think we all know that there are plenty of Malaysian lorries, buses motorcycles and passenger vehicles that come in and out of Singapore almost on a daily basis. I am sure that the Government would have to factor the presence of this large number of foreign ICE vehicles in Singapore as we work towards the plan in 2040. So, I will be grateful for the clarification.Dr Janil Puthucheary: Mr Chairman, I thank the Member Mr Dennis Tan for his question. Certainly, the presence of foreign ICE vehicles is going to be an important consideration going forward. We are just getting started on our journey. If you look at what we are doing with the incentives, the waiver of some of the tax structures and some of the changes that we have to make, our regulatory space has not quite settled.But when it does and as it does, one of the things we will have to look at is the relationship between what we do for Singaporean vehicles and then how that impacts what happens to non-Singaporean vehicles that are ICE vehicles when they come in. So, it is a factor but a it is a little bit premature to be absolutely settled on how it should be treated at this point.The Chairman: Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.Mr Sitoh Yih Pin: Sir, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng mentioned about the $200 million that was spent on safety, but he has not touched on safety of AVs. I know there are trials on AVs in NUS and NTU. But can he elaborate more because the public wants to be absolutely sure that AVs are safe on the road.Dr Janil Puthucheary: Mr Chairman, I thank Mr Sitoh for the question and I am going to answer the question even though he directed it to my colleague, Mr Baey Yam Keng.12.15 pmAbsolutely, public safety is a key consideration in how we develop our AVs. It is part of our phased and gated approach in the AV development. But it is also part of how we hope to have opportunities for the public to experience Autonomous Vehicles in a safe and controlled manner; and for the developers and operators to then learn about what is the public experience on Autonomous Vehicles so that the experience can be improved.The Chairman: Mr Melvin Yong.Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye: Thank you, Chairman. I follow-up on that question on autonomous vehicles, beyond safety, I am asking about job security. Autonomous Vehicles can potentially disrupt the livelihood of more than 50,000 workers who depend on driving to make a living. I am heartened to hear the efforts are already being made to familiarise our Bus Captains with AV technology. The union has been working very closely with LTA on that.But there are others such as taxi drivers, private hire drivers, heavy vehicle drivers, school bus drivers, and recently, I even visited and found that even driving instructors will be impacted and eventually displaced by AV technology. We must not forget them in our push towards AVs.May I asked the Ministry and the LTA to work with NTUC for similar AV familiarisation and transition programmes for the respective workers groups?Dr Janil Puthucheary: Mr Chairman, absolutely, we would be very happy to work with NTUC and our tripartite partners. I will go a step further. I think it is essential that we do so and we would not be able to address the space adequately if it were not for the strong partnerships that we are able to develop.I would assure Mr Melvin Yong and his union colleagues that there will be plenty of jobs. The one thing we cannot be assured of is that everything will stay the same. But there will be plenty of jobs and if we take the right approach in terms of thinking ahead, developing these roadmaps around retraining and re-skilling, and then having our workers and our unions actively engage in that process of retraining and re-skilling, then everybody will be well looked after.The Chairman: Mr Louis Ng.Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: Thank you, Sir. I have two clarifications on the Cross Island Line (CRL). I thank Senior Minister of State Lam Pin Min for sharing that they are exploring the non-playing areas in SICC so that we can move the worksite A1W1. But can I check whether we are looking into moving just a partial worksite of A1W1, or moving the entire worksite into the non-playing areas in SICC?The second question is with regard to the establishment of the Environmental Advisory Panel that we are setting up to provide independent assessment of the implementation of the environmental monitoring and management plan. Can I just check who is LTA going to select to be part of this Panel?Dr Lam Pin Min: I would like to thank Mr Louis Ng for his supplementary questions and his interest in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR). Before I dwell into the questions that he has asked, I would like to assure the House that LTA, as well as MOT, have been working very, very closely with the nature groups in this journey. We have been engaging the nature groups and various stakeholders very intensively over the past six to seven years. I myself have met the nature groups' leadership on many occasions; even my predecessor, Minister Josephine Teo had done the same.And this trust that we have built between MOT, LTA and the nature groups (NGs), is a very strong one. Therefore, I would like to reassure Mr Louis Ng as well as the rest of the nature groups' leadership, that we continue to work with them, even after the announcement of the alignment of CRL.In fact, post-announcement, LTA has already engaged has already engaged the advanced engineering study consultant to look into the design of the alignment of the stations for CRL Phase 2 and that includes the optimisation of the worksite at A1W1. We shall wait for the report of the study before we can ascertain exactly how much we can optimise A1W1. But rest assured that we are also in a discussion with SICC to see how we can use some of the non-play sites within the golf course, so that we can minimise the impact of the the engineering works to the environment.At the same time, we have also engaged an environmental impact study sub-consultant who will work with the advanced engineering study consultant to study the environmental impact of Cross Island Line Phase 2 on key biodiversity areas along its alignment.I understand that Mr Louis Ng is also quite concerned about the Raffles Banded Langurs. LTA has also enlisted the help of our local primate specialist, Dr Andie Ang – we all know her very well – to study these together with the EIS consultant. There has been actually quite a number of mitigating measures suggested by Dr Andie Ang and we are currently working very closely with her.With respect to the Member's specific question on the worksite, like I have mentioned, we will await the study, but definitely we will see how we can optimise the site in order to minimise the impact on the primates that he has mentioned – Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello and Raphael. We will make sure that the impact will be kept to a minimal, as much as possible.As to the Member's second question on the Advisory Panel, I think we shall wait for LTA to make the necessary announcement.The Chairman: Mr Pritam Singh.Mr Pritam Singh: Thank you, Sir. Just two questions for the MOT office-holders. The first question pertains to a point I raised in my Budget debate speech about private bus drivers in Singapore and some of their concerns arising out of the COVID-19 situation. Does MOT have a perspective or position on how they can be helped and reached out to, in this time of need?The second clarification arises from Senior Minister of State Janil's sharing on the purchase of public buses. I think 60 buses were purchased. What initiatives does the Ministry have in mind for the earlier adaptation for electric buses for the private sector? There are a lot of buses that are used to transport workers in Singapore, for example, and that can only support the Government's mission of the transit to electric vehicles in general.Dr Janil Puthucheary: Mr Chairman, on Mr Singh's first point. The best help for the private bus drivers is going to be when business is usual is returned to and the tourists come back and workers need to be transferred and the current crisis is over. They will benefit from some of the measures that are in the larger support package for businesses in general and for Singaporeans in general. We have not gotten a specific package for private bus drivers, but as business entities in general, they will be assisted. But it is something we were looking at. And if there is an appropriate way and appropriate opportunity to do so, it is something that we can consider.There are differences though, through the taxi operators, for example. There are ways in which we make sure that it goes down to the individual worker and so forth, and that is, the outcome that we would like to achieve.For the electrification of private sector buses, the changes around vehicle emission schemes would be one of the key measures through which we hope they would be incentivised to then think about transition to electric platforms. The difficulty, of course, is that there are not quite as many models and platforms of that size today. There will be, as the technology improves, but we hope to be able to incentivise this from the emissions perspective.The 60 buses that Mr Singh mentioned – 50 diesel hybrid – they demonstrate some of the difficulties that we have. We are exploring how to deploy and operationalise this technology and see what we need in terms of maintenance or depot reconfiguration, changes to the skill sets in our workers. And that is something where we have the entire network to deal with. I think for the smaller operators, it may take a little bit longer before they are able to make these changes. So, we do have some time to do it to meet our targets, but we will find ways to incentivise and encourage them to develop the skills and ability to do so.The Chairman: Mr Yee Chia Hsing.Mr Yee Chia Hsing: Thank you, Chairman. I hear from Senior Minister of State Janil that in 10 years' time, almost 100% of the new cars sold will be electric vehicles or clean energy vehicles. But now we are at 0.1%. How do we move from 0.1% to 100% in 10 years?Like I have mentioned in our Budget speech, I think we need a five-year target rather than shoot for a 10-year mark. If in five years, we are not even hitting 5%, I think we will miss our target.The other feedback is that there are a lot of car models, EV models which are available in the UK, but the dealers do not bring them in. What is MOT doing to push all these dealers to bring these models in? That is one feedback from consumers, that they have very limited EV choices.Dr Janil Puthucheary: Mr Chairman, indeed our strategies that I have discussed – the four moves – are to reduce thecost differential between an electric vehicle and an internal combustion engine vehicle, encourage consumers to take this up as a choice, both because of the aspiration to be cleaner and greener, then hopefully it makes increasing economic sense to do so. Over the lifetime of a vehicle, an electric vehicle, hopefully, should incur less maintenancecost, the mechanisms are easier to maintain, and also less energycost.So, the short answer is we hope consumers will make the choice and we are trying to incentivise consumers to make the choice, as a result of which dealers should respond.Internationally, many manufacturers are developing new models and have committed in some cases, to only develop electric models past a certain date. That should also help to lower the price of these vehicles.Put together, we hope that over the next 10 years, there are increasing reasons for Singaporeans who choose to buy a car to choose to buy an electric car. And then, we hope that somewhere around 2030, we will have the last sale of an internal combustion engine vehicle and then, over a 10-year cycle by 2040, we will have an entire cleaner and greener fleet here in Singapore.The Chairman: Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.Mr Sitoh Yih Pin: Mr Chairman, I thank all Members for their speeches and contributions. In particular, I would like to thank the MOT team for their hard work and support. Sir with that, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $1,992,837,500 for Head W ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $9,484,729,700 for Head W ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates."

        "Content": "Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.Mental Healthcare in SchoolsMs Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): Sir, first, I want to thank our school counsellors for their role in supporting our students despite their small numbers. Based on the data provided to a Parliamentary Question on counsellors, I estimate the counsellor-student ratio to be approximately 1:800, which seems to pale in comparison to some Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) education systems. Is the Ministry planning to improve this ratio to better provide first-line mental health support to students?MOE currently deploys part-time MOE-trained school counsellors, para-counsellors, Flexi-Adjunct School Counsellors and Teacher Counsellors to augment school counsellors. Could the Ministry clarify on the choice behind deploying these staff instead of directly increasing the number of school counsellors?Thirty-five percent of respondents from the public consultation on mental health that my team and I did mentioned quality in school counselling as a key concern. One respondent shared that her experience with school counsellors has not been helpful. I quote, \"One completely dismissed me when I told her about my symptoms, and another one recommended exercise as a form of weight loss for someone with an eating disorder.\"Teachers must have relevant subject matter expertise before attending teacher training at NIE. However, I understand that applicants for school counsellors on the \"Applicants Without Counselling Training\" track need only hold a university degree. Would the Ministry consider giving the same value and rigour to the role of counsellors by ensuring that all candidates have appropriate competencies, experience and/or professional qualifications before attending the necessary school-specific training? Could the Ministry also share how it assesses the competency of school counsellors and how this is aligned with national competency assessment frameworks for counselling professionals?Despite a general consensus that early detection leads to better health outcomes, and the need for regular assessment of students' needs and health called by the Health Promoting Schools Framework, free health screenings for students currently focus exclusively on physical health.Yet, according to WHO, half of mental health illnesses start by 14 years of age. MOH reported that studies in Singapore suggest depression alone affects up 18% of youths. Moreover, WHO has found that late detection of mental health conditions is known to result in \"increased morbidity, mortality and the adoption of life-threatening and life-adopting self-treatments\".As currently practised in schools like Yale-NUS College on admission, will the Ministry consider putting in place mental health screenings every year? In a whole-child approach, there is no health without mental health. The screenings are not meant to be diagnostic in purpose, but to increase the channels where teachers, counsellors and parents can identify students who need more help to adopt upstream preventive measures. I believe this mental health check will better support the engagement and feedback process between teachers, counsellors and parents.Enhancing Financial Support for StudentsMr Zainal Sapari: Chairman, education is the best social leveler. Hence, it is important to give emphasis on what we can do to help children from low-income families in terms of education. A key approach to this is by offering financial assistance to ensure no child will be denied of a good education due to the family’s financial situation. Hence, I am heartened at the announcements to enhance MOE Financial Assistance Scheme and bursaries for higher education.I believe we can do more for ITE students because they are at a phase of acquiring important vocational skills. Could MOE share what further efforts are being taken to enhance financial support for our students, specifically on the bursaries for ITE students?MOE's Financial Assistance Scheme and Edusave AwardsMr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap: Sir, currently, Singaporean students in the six full-time madrasahs are not eligible for MOE's Edusave Awards as well as its Financial Assistance Scheme.At this juncture, I would like to declare that I have a child who is studying in a full-time madrasah.In 2015, I asked MOE through a Parliamentary Question to consider extending Edusave Awards to madrasah students. The Minister responded that, \"Edusave Awards recognise secular academic and non-academic achievements in the context of MOE-funded schools. It would not be appropriate to extend awards to private schools, including those in the six full-time madrasahs that offer a total curriculum that comprises both compulsory religious and secular subjects.\"During 2012'sCOSdebate, I and another Member requested to have Edusave account and contributions to be extended to Singaporean students who are studying in non-public schools. MOE declined this request and explained that the Ministry's policy is to encourage all Singaporean children, as far as possible, to enroll in national schools with the objective to forge social cohesion and common national identity.Nonetheless, Prime Minister in his 2013 National Day Rally speech announced that Edusave accounts and contributions would be given to all students of school-going age, which includes full-time madrasah students. The Prime Minister mentioned, \"This is a signal that we value every child and we help with a sense of solidarity among the next generation.\"Sir, on the very basis of valuing every child and a sense of solidarity as mentioned the Prime Minister, MOE should consider to extend Edusave Awards and its Financial Assistance Scheme to Singaporean full-time madrasah students.On MOE's considerations of not awarding Edusave Awards to madrasah students due to madrasah offering a total curriculum that comprises both compulsory religious and secular subjects, this can be addressed by only granting the Edusave Award for secular subjects.Subsidies for Non-Singaporean StudentsMs Anthea Ong: Sir, Singaporean Primary school students from lower income families have their tuition fees heavily subsidised. In addition, they also receive free textbooks and uniforms as well as some pocket money.However, these benefits do not apply to students with foreign passports, even if one of their parents or legal guardians is a Singaporean Citizen or PR.Will the Ministry consider extending the same subsidies and benefits to such students under our UN Convention for the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) obligations?7.30 pmFinancial Assistance for Students in IHLsMr Ang Wei Neng: Chairman, we have been encouraging Singaporean students to upgrade and the Government has also increased the capacity of the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). But tuition fees at the IHLs have been on the rise since 2010.At Universities, the fee hikes for local undergraduates for previous years have ranged from 0.6% to 8%.CNBC estimated that Singapore Universitycosts have risen 38% since 2007. Most recently, in August 2018, all six local Universities have raised tuition fees. Students in the Institutes of Technical Education (ITEs) and Polytechnics were also similarly subjected to higher fees in 2019.It is important that students from under-privileged families can enrol in IHLs to use education as a lever to uplift themselves. With an increasingcost of living, we hope MOE can increase the financial assistance to students in IHLs. I will also like to urge MOE to consider disbursing more targeted bursaries which award different quantum depending on the student's family income level and socio-economic background.Enhanced Support for ITE StudentsMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Mr Chairman, over the years, the Ministry has done well to ensure that our ITE adequately prepares students for career in a knowledge-based economy. There are bursary to support students in need and scholarship to affirm the good work of students. Through this and other measures we have raised the standard of ITE graduates. Many of whom contribute meaningfully to our country and economy.I welcome the enhancements to the Government bursaries for ITE students as announced in the Budget Statement and would like to ask if MOE can share more details on the enhanced support, including the expected number of students who will benefit from this enhancement and how they can apply for it.Secondly, it was announced during the Budget Statement that there will be more overseas internship programmes and youth development initiatives with a new target for 70% of local graduates from Institutes of Higher Learnings to have overseas exposure. Such programmes will be extremely beneficial for students in today's globalised interconnected world.The question I would like to raise is whether these programmes and initiatives will also cover ITE students. We need to ensure that ITE students also have access and can benefit from these opportunities. It will serve as a form of encouragement, an eye-opener to develop further interest in their course.CCAs and Social MixingMiss Cheng Li Hui: Sir, during 2018 President’s debate in this house, I spoke about CCAs being the place for students to pick up non-academic knowledge and skills. I have met several students who were very disappointed that they could not join the CCA of their choice because they lack relevant experience.I am heartened to read in the news in Jan 2020, that MOE has started a pilot with several Primary schools to remove selection trials. This is excellent. Let our children pursue sports or other interests they may have. CCAs should be for student to build friendships based on interest and passion.We should also have inter-school CCAs to encourage social mixing and bring down barriers of class. Inter-school CCAs can also bring together students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds and hone their interpersonal skills. Teachers will also have a good platform to introduce the concept of social inclusivity.I hope the Minister will look into my suggestion to introduce inter-school CCAs so that our students can enjoy a more enriching CCA experience.The Chairman: Mr Terence Ho, can you take both cuts together.Arts Curriculum in SchoolsMr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member): Chairman, as part of holistic education, our students are exposed to arts programme, music and aesthetics lessons. While there is a good range of arts programmes in schools today, they are largely ad hoc and may not be part of a longer term vision for how the arts can play a more integral role.From the existing music syllabus, there is currently no mention and teaching of Singaporean compositions, local composers, musicians and artistes in the music curriculum. For example, there are 126 Cultural Medallion recipients, but how many of our younger generation are aware of their achievements and are inspired by their works?Furthermore, can MOE consider to include and introduce our ethnic traditional instruments during music lessons? If we do it strategically and interestingly, this could lead to the interest to participate in the school band and orchestra. And, provide a pipeline to build a vibrant performing arts ecosystem in the school. Music and arts curriculum should not only be held within the classrooms. Teachers and students should step-out to indulge in the atmospheres of the arts at the different locations.Therefore, I propose for MOE to consider. One, allow our students to pay visit to national arts companies, watch theatre shows, musical performances and even concerts. Arts groups and companies can host these students on one-hour learning journeys. Two, involve artist and musicians in curriculum planning; allow them to have dialogue sessions and conversations with the community and arts sector, to build a robust curriculum.Arts exposure at any early age continues to be important, supports the holistic development of the child, seeds the development of future audiences while increasing the social commons. At the same time, an education in and through the arts helps students appreciate other cultures and develop Singapore pride. In Mandarin, Chairman.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Arts can stimulate curiosity and encourage creativity amongst students. Besides the teaching of knowledge, schools are also involved in the character education and holistic development of students. Therefore, making arts classes part of the curriculum for every student is a component of holistic education. When youths display talent and aptitude for the arts, we can provide more professional training platforms for them, with the hope that they will become world-class artists in the future.In order to develop local artistic talents, we should promote local arts through education. I hope MOE will consider including more local arts resources in the planning of music and art curriculum in schools. I also hope MOE will consider inviting past recipients of the Cultural Medallion and Young Artist Award to share their creative journeys and experience. These inspirational teaching materials and personality profiles could become the cradle from which the next generation of artists can be nurtured.In addition, there are many artistic historical buildings in Singapore. As the teaching of music and the arts should not be confined to the classroom, schools can consider organising field trips for students to visit these historical buildings, to stimulate their interest and enhance their cultural knowledge. Arts groups can also conduct dialogues and workshops for students to interact close-up with artists.I would also like to suggest that MOE engage local artists and Cultural Medallion recipients during the process of curriculum planning, in order to design an arts curriculum with a stronger local flavour. This will help promote local arts and culture. We must make arts and culture accessible, and ensure that the essence of Singapore’s arts and culture is passed down from generation to generation, creating a sustainable ecosystem for the arts.Arts University(In English): My second cut on Arts University. The Arts University will serve the purpose to fill up jobs in the market contributing to the employability of these graduates. By transforming and upgrading our art academies, this will draw local and overseas talents into enrolling into these institutions. Graduates from the Arts University can contribute not only to the arts and creative industry, but they are able to bring Singapore into a more competitive design and creative market in the global economy.From a survey, \"Passion\" was the most critical factor that drew workers to the arts sector; it is also the main reason why these workers remained in the sector. Arts workers also saw themselves as contributing positively to the arts and the wider society through their work.For example, the Government can consider developing a research centre with the future University, to grow our creative industry in performing arts and visual art. We have to nurture our local talents. These efforts will help create vibrancy in the arts scene, heighten motivation among the expected.In conclusion, Singapore should be mature enough now as a country to give its own degrees in the Arts. Why should we depend on Universities in other countries to say how good our teaching is? Two, If we can have Singapore degrees in other subjects, why not the Arts? Three, the quality of the teaching and curriculum at NAFA, Lasalle and Intercultural Theatre Institute are recognised by overseas Universities. MOE should allow a system to let Singapore academics and industry practitioners recognise the quality and approve the award of degrees.As an aspiring Arts Nation, I believe that we should have our own Arts University.The Chairman: Leader of the House."

        "MPs Speaking": "[The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat)]",
        "Content": "The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat):\tMr Speaker, Sir, before I move the Motion, allow me to share the journey of what you are about to hear.For the last four Budget speeches, I have used two files and taken up slightly over two hours. Colleagues had been very patient, thank you.This time, the major changes that we have to respond to – economic slowdown, climate change and growing uncertainties – added many pages. Then, the global climate across the world – psychological, economic – was hit by the sudden storm of a virus outbreak. So, over the past few weeks, my colleagues in Cabinet, in MOF, have been managing various fronts.To support our national efforts, the Budget file grew and grew. So, today, I have three files instead of two. So, please be patient.Mr Speaker, Sir. I beg to move, \"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the Financial Year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021.\"This year, we usher in a new decade – one marked by tectonic shifts in our operating environment and major uncertainties.Singapore's economy grew by a modest 0.7% in 2019. This is the weakest growth since the 2008 Financial Crisis.Just as the global economy was beginning to recover, the Coronavirus Disease 2019, or COVID-19, outbreak hit us.The outbreak will certainly impact our economy. The tourism and aviation industries are most directly affected. Visitor arrivals to Singapore and air traffic through Changi have declined, and with it, hotel occupancy rates. The virus outbreak has also disrupted supply chains and created ripple effects on other sectors, especially now that our economy is so much more integrated with China's.MTI has downgraded the GDP forecast from between 0.5% and 2.5%, to between -0.5% and 1.5%. However, the duration and severity of this outbreak and the impact on the global economy are still unclear. While MTI's baseline is for GDP growth to come in at 0.5% for the full year, we must be prepared that the economic impact may be worse than we projected.Our immediate concern is to protect you and your families. We will put in every effort to slow down the spread of the virus.Our frontline agencies have been fighting and containing the outbreak. I will set aside an additional $800 million in this Budget to support these efforts. The bulk of this will go to MOH. This is on top of the substantial resources already committed each year to public health.Let me, on behalf of the Government, express our gratitude to all our frontline officers who have been working tirelessly, day and night, over weekends, in our fight against the outbreak. [Applause.] You have exemplified the resilience and indomitable spirit of our people. But please take care of yourselves.I am confident that together, we will stay strong and get through these trying times.With these uncertainties, I know Singaporeans are understandably very concerned about the impact on our businesses and jobs.I will introduce two special packages, with a total budget of $5.6 billion.The first is the Stabilisation and Support Package. This will stabilise the economy and support our workers and enterprises, by helping workers to stay in their jobs and enterprises with cash flow. I will give additional help to sectors more directly affected by the outbreak.Households will be impacted by the slowdown too. In every Budget, we always provide support to families. But in view of the current situation, we will have a special Care and Support Package, to provide additional, timely help to more households withcost of living. The less well-off will get more help.First, let me elaborate on how we will help our workers and enterprises to weather the near-term economic uncertainties.Our foremost concern is jobs. We want to help our workers retain their jobs, and use any lull period to upgrade their skills, and be ready when the upturn comes. As NTUC Secretary-General Ng Chee Meng and his union leaders said, \"Every worker matters\".I will therefore provide a Stabilisation and Support Package, amounting to $4 billion.To help our workers stay employed, I will support enterprises by defraying their wagecost, through two schemes.I will introduce a Jobs Support Schemeto help enterprises retain their local workers. For every local worker in employment, I will offset 8% of the wages, up to a monthly wage cap of $3,600, for three months. This payment will be given to employers by the end of July this year. With over 1.9 million local employees in Singapore, this willcost the Government $1.3 billion and benefit all enterprises and their local employees.For enterprises that have invested in raising productivity, I urge them to continue to upgrade and to share the gains with their workers. Hence, I will enhance the Wage Credit Schemetosupport wage increases for Singaporean employees.Currently, the Wage Credit Scheme co-funds wage increases for Singaporean employees earning a gross monthly wage of up to $4,000. I will raise the monthly wage ceiling from $4,000 to $5,000, for qualifying wage increases given in 2019 and 2020, so that more Singaporean employees will benefit.I will also raise the Government co‑funding levels for 2019 and 2020 qualifying wage increases by five-percentage points, to 20% and 15% respectively.With these enhancements, another $1.1 billion will go to about 90,000 enterprises, to benefit more than 700,000 Singaporean employees.The Stabilisation and Support Package will also provide economy-wide support to help enterprises with cash flow.First, I will grant a Corporate Income Tax Rebate for Year of Assessment 2020, at a rate of 25% of tax payable, capped at $15,000 per company. This rebate will benefit all tax-paying companies, andcost about $400 million.I will also enhance several tax treatments under the corporate tax system for one year. For instance, I will allow enterprises a faster write-down of their investments in plant and machinery, and renovation and refurbishment, incurred for Year of Assessment 2021. This will put more cash in the hands of our enterprises.For example, hotels can now take advantage of this lull period to carry out upgrading work, and be better prepared for the upturn.To help enterprises access working capital more easily, I will also enhance the Enterprise Financing Scheme's Working Capital Loan component for one year. I will raise the maximum loan quantum from $300,000 to $600,000, and increase our risk-share on these loans to 80%, from the current 50% to 70%. With the large part of the risks taken up by the Government, I trust that our financial institutions will do their part to support viable SMEs.We will also support tenants and lessees of Government-managed properties, including those under JTC, HDB, SLA, STB, and SDC. They can approach our agencies to discuss options for more flexible rental paymentssuch as instalment plans. Each request will be assessed individually, taking into account the enterprise’s circumstances.Sectors directly affected by COVID-19 will get additional support. These five sectors are: tourism, aviation, retail, food services and point-to-point transport services.To help employers in these sectors retain and reskill workers, we will enhance support under the Adapt and Grow initiative for this year, specifically through redeployment programmesin the tourism, aviation, retail and food services sectors. For these sectors, we will extend the funding period for reskilling from three months to a maximum of six months.Together with the Jobs Support Scheme, we will support employers in these sectors to retain and train more than 330,000 local workers. These workers can make full use of the down time for training and upskilling, to prepare for the recovery.We will also help affected sectors with their operatingcosts and cash flow. For the tourism sector:I will grant a Property Tax Rebate of 30% for the year 2020, for the accommodation and function room components of licensed hotels and serviced apartments, and prescribed Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE) venues. International cruise and regional ferry terminals will receive a 15% Property Tax Rebate and the Integrated Resorts will receive a 10% Property Tax Rebate.For enterprises in the tourism sector, we will be working with Participating Financial Institutions to introduce aTemporary Bridging Loan Programmefor a year,with a loan quantum of up to $1 million and interest rate capped at 5%. The Government will take on 80% of the risk of the loan. This will provide more cash flow on top of the enhanced working capital loan I announced earlier.For the aviation sector, we will implement a suite of measures, comprising rebates on aircraft landing and parking charges, assistance to ground handling agents, and rental rebates for shops and cargo agents at Changi Airport.I will also grant a15% Property Tax Rebatefor Changi Airport.To support commercial establishments in the food services and retail business, the Government will take the lead. NEA will provide a full month of rental waiver to stallholders in NEA-managed hawker centres and markets. Other Government agencies, like HDB, will provide half a month of rental waiver to its commercial tenants.To support establishments that operate in private property, I will also grant a 15% Property Tax Rebatefor qualifying commercial properties. I strongly urge landlords to pass this on to their tenants by reducing rentals.MOT has announced a Point-to-Point Support Package. I am heartened to know that many taxi and private hire car operators have come out strongly to support the initiative by matching the Government’s contribution. This spirit of partnership is what we need to weather this challenging period together.Details of the Stabilisation and Support Package are in the Annex. [Please refer toAnnex A-1.] The Ministers-in-charge of the various measures will share further details in due course.We will continue to monitor the situation closely. If needed, we can and are prepared to do more.I will speak about the Care and Support Package for households later in my speech.The COVID-19 outbreak is a stark reminder of the continued importance of maintaining a sound fiscal footing to deal with surprises and unexpected scenarios. In particular, we are able to mount a decisive response to support Singaporeans and workers through uncertain times only because of good long-term planning.I announced in 2018 that we plan to raise the GST by two percentage points, to 9%, sometime from 2021 to 2025. This is to raise recurrent revenues to meet our recurrent spending, particularly for healthcare.After reviewing our revenue and expenditure projections and considering the current state of the economy, I have decided that the GST rate increase will not take effect in 2021.In other words, the GST rate will remain at 7% in 2021.However, we will not be able to put off the increase indefinitely. In fact, this outbreak has reinforced the importance of continued investment in our healthcare system, including the capability to deal with outbreaks. And we will still require recurrent sources of revenue to fund our recurrent spending needs in the medium term.Thus, the GST increase will still be needed by 2025. We will assess carefully the appropriate time for the increase. But rest assured we will provide Singaporeans sufficient lead time.I want to assure everyone that when we raise the GST rate, we will ensure that our taxes and transfers system remains progressive.We will continue to absorb GST on publicly-subsidised healthcare and education. And just as we have done in the past, we will provide an Assurance Package when the GST rate is raised. This will be a $6 billion package for Singaporeans, to cushion the increase as we transition to the higher GST rate.GST is paid by all in Singapore, including foreigners working and visiting here. But the Assurance Package will benefit Singaporeans.The majority of Singaporean households will receive offsets to cover at least five years’ worth of additional GST expenses incurred. So, the majority of Singaporean households will receive offsets to cover at least five years' worth of additional GST expenses incurred.Lower income households will receive much more. Those living in 1- to 3‑room HDB flats will receive offsets equivalent to about 10 years’ worth of additional GST expenses incurred.Under the Assurance Package for GST, every adult Singaporean will receive a cash payout of $700 to $1,600 over five years.To illustrate, a family of four with a combined income of $6,000 living in a 4‑room HDB flat can receive about $7,000 in offsets over five years in total. This includes cash of about $4,000.Over and above the transitional support, we already have the permanent GST Voucher or GSTV scheme. It defrays GST for lower- to middle-income Singaporeans. When the GST is raised, I will enhance the permanent GST Voucher scheme. I will maintain the Government’s public commitment to (a) fully offset the GST for the lower half of retiree households; (b) significantly offset the GST for the upper half of retiree households; and (c) offset about half of the GST for lower income households with no elderly persons.This is the Government’s way of ensuring our system of taxes and transfers remains progressive and supports Singaporeans through the change, while enabling us to fund our future needs in a sustainable way.To meet this commitment, I will set aside $6 billion for the Assurance Package in the GSTV Fund in this year’s Budget.Even as we navigate our near-term challenges, we must maintain our focus on the longer term, and on Singapore’s future.I have spoken about the accelerating structural shifts in the world in my previous Budget speeches: first, the decline in support for globalisation; second, the shift in global economic weight towards Asia, which brings new opportunities; third, the rapid advancement of technology, and more recently, the risk of a technologically bifurcated world; and finally, our own transition to an ageing society, which presents challenges and opportunities.We must understand these shifts and their deep implications as we chart our future together as one Singapore.After the Second World War, nations experienced several decades of growth and prosperity. Trade barriers fell, and global trade grew rapidly. Technological advances transformed people’s lives beyond recognition.Prosperity gave governments the resources to establish comprehensive safety nets and welfare programmes. These included unemployment benefits, pensions and healthcare, among others.But at the same time, globalisation and technology created winners and losers, and widened income inequalities between the skilled and unskilled. There are growing sentiments that globalisation and the multilateral system have failed. As a result, nations are turning inwards. Protectionism and nativism are on the rise.An ageing population, disruption to jobs and slowing economic growth are adding to fiscal pressures. Yet it is politically untenable to cut back on social benefits.When governments issue debt to fund social spending, they impose a growing debt burden on the next generation. This is happening at a time when the global economy is experiencing weaker growth and dampened sentiment.Central banks have lowered interest rates to unprecedented levels. In addition, asset purchases by central banks have resulted in abundant liquidity and raised concerns over the formation of asset bubbles.In fact, with limited fiscal space and ultra-low or even negative interest rates, governments and central banks are much less able to mount stabilisation measures.On the strategic front, the friction in the US-China relationship is a major source of tension and uncertainty, affecting global economic growth.The recent Phase 1 trade deal between them has headed off an immediate escalation. But it will not resolve the underlying strategic competition. This involves political systems, ideologies and values, and goes beyond trade and technology.On present trends, US-China tensions will recreate geopolitical fault lines and portend a bifurcated global order.I have sketched out the global structural shifts, economic uncertainties, and strategic tensions. I trust Members will see that we are entering a very challenging time. But we can, and we will pull through.To deal with these major shifts, we need a capable government, working closely with our people and a good plan.As a city-state, we are small, but nimble. We are a trusted node for trade and investment between Asia and the world. This is because of our political stability, commitment to rule of law and multilateralism, ease of doing business and strong intellectual property protection regime, among others.As a multi-cultural society, we have welcomed diversity and embraced openness. Our diversity has made us stronger and more valuable to the world.Our biggest asset is our exceptional people. We have come together and weathered many past storms, like the Global Financial Crisis, SARS, and now, the on-going COVID-19 outbreak.Budget 2020 is our strategic financial plan to prepare Singapore and Singaporeans to meet these challenges and seize new opportunities.This Budget, I will lay out our plans in four areas.First,to growour economy, transform our enterprises, to create opportunities for our people.Second,to carefor and nurture Singaporeans at every stage of their lives, to build a caring and inclusive society, where no one is left behind.Third,to build a liveable and sustainable Singapore in the face of climate change, secureour sovereignty as an independent nation and ensure our fiscal sustainability.And fourth, to mobilise Singaporeans to work together in this journey, to build a nation and a home we will always call our own.Let me start with growing our economy and transforming our enterprises.The structural changes I described earlier bring both opportunities and challenges. Technology and innovation will drive our productivity and our next phase of growth.Amidst declining support for globalisation, most of Asia remains committed to free trade and economic integration. The Asian economies have strong growth drivers and are projected to account for half of global GDP by 2040.Singapore is well-positioned to make the most of these structural changes. We recognised these changes early and made an early start on economic transformation. We set up the Future Economy Council, or FEC, in 2017 and we now have 23 Industry Transformation Maps, or ITMs.Our restructuring is bearing fruit. In the last three years, overall productivity, as measured by real value‑added per actual hour worked, rose by 2.6% per year. This is an improvement over the 2.2% per year growth in the preceding three-year period.Our enterprises are entering new markets and doing business globally. Singapore Business Federation’s 2019 National Business Survey shows that eight in 10 enterprises have an overseas presence, up from seven in 10 the previous year, despite global uncertainties. Their spirit of enterprise augurs well for the future.Overall, these efforts at enterprise transformation have translated into good wage growth. Between 2016 and 2019, real median income for Singaporeans grew by 3.7% per year, up from 3.2% per year in the preceding three years.Two years ago, I set out our vision of Singapore as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise.Our economy will be one driven by innovation and digitalisation. Singapore will serve as a launch pad for multi-nationals and regional corporates to access Asia, and for Asian enterprises to go global. Our enterprises will compete on value and reach new customers. And these enterprises will be powered by a skilled, adaptable and Asia-ready workforce.To support this vision, in this Budget, I will introduce a set of measures to drive our Transformation and Growth strategy. There are three key thrusts: first, enabling stronger partnerships; second, deepening enterprise capabilities; and third, developing our people.Including sums allocated in previous years, I am allocating a total of $8.3 billion over the next three years to enable Transformation and Growth.Let me begin with the first thrust of our Transformation and Growtheffort, which is toenable stronger partnerships: (a) with the world, to expand our economic space, and (b) within Singapore, to build on our work through the FEC and ITMs.As a small, open economy, we must continue to strengthen partnerships with the world. We have an extensive network of economic linkages, including Free Trade Agreements, International Investment Agreements and Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements. For example, Minister Indranee signed our latest Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement with Indonesia earlier this month.Beyond economic connectivity, we are enhancing our digital connectivity to create new value. Singapore Customs is connecting our Networked Trade Platform with the customs portals of our trading partners. Just last month, we concluded our first Digital Economy Agreement with Chile and New Zealand. It will foster interoperability, and address frontier issues like artificial intelligence governance, to enable more trade.The digitalisation of finance will also open up new ways of doing business. Between 2015 and 2019, annual investments in FinTech (Financial Technology) have risen six-fold to over $1 billion. Players from different domains and around the region are coming together to bid for the MAS' digital banking licences.To make the most of our global links, we must strengthen partnerships within Singapore to bring good ideas to global markets.Under our Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 Plan, we are sustaining investment into promising ideas. These include artificial intelligence, industrial robotics, urban solutions and sustainability, and the biomedical sciences, among others.Through partnerships among the Government, industry and the research community, we are turning these ideas into new businesses with global potential.For instance, Singapore was one of the first cities to allow autonomous vehicle, or AV, testing on public roads. Many AV players have set up here, testing their technologies with the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU), seeking to win the global race.In the biomedical industry, the number of start-ups has doubled from 2014. More than 300 biomedical start-ups are now bringing discoveries from bench to bedside and looking to export them to the region.In fact, our research institutes are part of the global fight against COVID-19, developing diagnostic kits already in use here and sent to China. This is one of the fruits of our long-term investments in research and innovation.Within each industry, we need to strengthen partnerships to deepen industry-wide capabilities. Even as our enterprises compete to differentiate themselves, they must come together to solve common challenges.Trade Associations and Chambers, or TACs, play an important role. For example, the Container Depot and Logistics Association (Singapore) is developing an electronic payment system that can help depot operators and transport companies save time andcost. Details are in the Annex. [Please refer toAnnex B-4.]To sustain the good progress, we will enhance our support for TACs to scale up and raise the capabilities of their industries.Enterprise Singapore will launch a pilot Executive‑in‑Residence programme, to fund more than 10 TACs covering all sectors of the economy, to hire experienced executives and provide expert advice to enterprises in their industries.Likewise, Merchants’ Associations play a critical role in upgrading heartland enterprises, such as what the Chong Pang City Merchant and Hawker's Association has done.This year, Enterprise Singapore will launch a new Heartland Enterprise Upgrading Programme to support Merchants' Associations to drive transformation of heartland enterprises. [Please refer toAnnex B-1.]I have covered how we are deepening partnerships. The second thrust of our Transformation and Growthis to deepen capabilities, at every stage of an enterprise's growth. From starting up, to growing, to transforming further.Our enterprises must be the incubators of innovation, the crucibles for skills upgrading and the creators of good jobs for our people.Many of our enterprises are deepening their capabilities – by innovating, digitalising, and venturing overseas. These include smaller companies like Yong Leng Trading Company, a local provider of sealing solutions for industrial customers, and PDS International, a developer and distributor of personal protective equipment. By adopting digital platforms, they have accessed new markets, raised revenues and reducedcosts.Larger local companies are also transforming. Goldbell Group, an industrial vehicle leasing company, launched an in-house accelerator, while Moveon, an optics manufacturer, partnered our research institutes to develop enhanced production technologies for micro-optical systems. More details are in the Annex. [Please refer to Annex B-4.]We will enhance our support to enterprises, at each stage of their growth, to deepen their capabilities in an enterprise-centric way.Let me begin with start-ups. Our start-up eco-system is vibrant. There are about 3,800 technology start-ups in Singapore and about 150 venture capital funds investing in start-ups here and in the region. Our start-up eco-system is ranked in the top 15 globally in the Global Startup Ecosystem report.Startup SG helps start-ups get their ideas off the ground. It provides holistic support, including co-investments, mentorship and physical space. Through co-investment schemes like Startup SG Equity, we have catalysed over $560 million in private sector funding over the last four years.This year, we will improve support for deep-tech start-ups. Deep-tech start-ups are those in emerging technology areas such as pharmbio and medtech, advanced manufacturing and agri-food tech. They have high potential to be competitive and stimulate innovation in their sectors.But these start-ups need larger investments, longer gestation periods and face higher risks. Investors are hence less prepared to invest in deep-tech start-ups.To catalyse investment into deep-tech start-ups, I will set aside an additional $300 million under the Startup SG Equity. We expect this to draw in more than $800 million of private funding over the next 10 years. This will give deep-tech start-ups better access to capital, expertise and industry networks. [Please refer to Annex B-1.]Beyond start-ups, many enterprises, both new and established, are seeking to grow. We have been supporting them, through schemes such as the SMEs Go Digital programme; and the Market Readiness Assistance grant.This year, we will enhance support for these enterprises through an Enterprise Grow Package. This Package aims to help enterprises identify business needs, adopt pre-approved digital technologies and take the first steps to enter new markets.First, we will launch the GoBusiness platform, asingle touchpoint for enterprises to transact with Government digitally.Second, we will drive greater adoption of digital technology. We will expand the SMEs Go Digital programme. Across all 23 ITM sectors, we will have Industry Digital Plans or equivalents, and enable enterprises to access pre-approved digital solutions.Third, to help more enterprises enter new markets, we will enhance the Market Readiness Assistance grant by expanding the funding support and coverage, to include, for example, FTA consultancy. [Please refer to Annex B-1.]We must continue to support the growth of our enterprises and as they mature, drive deeper transformation.Today, through the Enterprise Development Grant, or EDG, Enterprise Singapore provides integrated support for enterprises to innovate and internationalise. For enterprises to transform, they need to strengthen their leadership and management capabilities.This year, we will introduce an Enterprise Transform Package, witha focus on leadership. Enterprise Singapore will launch the Enterprise Leadership for Transformation Programme, to support business leaders of promising small and medium enterprises in achieving the next bound of growth.Over the next three years, we aim to support business leaders of 900 enterprises in business transformation, with training and mentorship.We will work with Institutes of Higher Learning or IHLs, banks, and industry experts, and facilitate collaboration. In tandem, we will continue to broaden transformation through the EDG, by expanding its reach. In FY2020, we expect to support about 3,000 projects through the EDG, an increase of more than 10% from the number today.The third thrust of our Transformation and Growth effort is to develop our people, so as to enable our people to access good jobs, earn good wages and stay employable. Economic growth is a means to creating a better life for our people.We must nurture every Singaporean to their fullest potential.The Government's promise to Singaporeans is this: regardless of your starting point, as long as you are willing to learn, we will support you to learn throughout life – in pre-employment, in your working years and as we pursue lifelong learning and employability.We will bring in different partners, including IHLs, enterprises and the Labour Movement to help you do so.Let me begin with the role of our IHLs. Our IHLs provide a strong foundation in learning and have partnerships with industry. IHLs and the industry have distinct roles, and by aligning these to keep learning relevant, students can secure good jobs.Employment rates are high and starting salaries have increased. We develop Singaporean talent in partnership with enterprises under the Singapore-Industry Scholarship scheme. Many of them have graduated and are developing their careers with leading enterprises like ST Engineering and Micron.Our local students are well-prepared to thrive in other countries and cultures, including in Asia. About half of all local IHL students today gain experience abroad, through programmes such as internships, exchanges and service learning or study trips.In my pre-Budget dialogue with youth leaders, I was struck by their understanding of the importance of learning new skills and exploring new opportunities. They look forward to overseas exposure and postings in the region.To support our local students to acquire cross-cultural skills and understand our region better, we will set ourselves a \"70-70\" target– 70% of local IHL graduates to have an overseas experience, and 70% of this group to have exposure to ASEAN, China, or India.To achieve this target, we will introduce a new Asia-Ready Exposure Programme to support local youths' visits to cities in ASEAN, China or India. We will also enhance support for internships under the Global Ready Talent Programme.Beyond pre-employment education, we must also support our people who are already at work. With shorter technology cycles and more intense global competition, skills acquired when we are young need to be constantly refreshed. Career transitions will be more common, even the norm.Our SkillsFuture movement seeks to enable our people to learn, develop new skills and stay employable.Five years after the launch of SkillsFuture, we have made good progress. The training participation rate has risen, from 35% in 2015, to 49% in 2019. As of end 2019, the SkillsFuture Credit has helped more than half a million Singaporeans pick up new skills and develop new interests. This includes Mr Koh Wui-Tek, a FinTech executive who applied his learning in project management to serving his clients, as well as Mdm Juriah Jahaya, a certified trainer who deepened her people development skills.Singaporeans are also upskilling and accessing good jobs in growth sectors with the support of employers. Younger Singaporeans are undergoing on-the-job training while getting a qualification. Singaporeans who have been working for some time have adapted and grown their skills.One good example is Ms Nur Hidayah Binte Abu Bakar, whom I met at WSG last year. After leaving the electronics industry, Ms Hidayah joined AETOS Holdings as an Auxiliary Police Officer. She went through the tough training as part of the Professional Conversion Programme. Today, she not only earns more, and has a clearer career pathway, but she is also helping to keep Singapore safe. [Please refer to Annex B-4.]I am very encouraged by the efforts made by Singaporeans to acquire new skills, in the midst of the major structural changes in the global economy. To further support them in this journey, the Government will invest in the Next Bound of SkillsFuture. There will be three elements to this: first, enabling the individual; second, enhancing the role of our enterprises; and third, a special focus on mid-career workers.First, to support Singaporeans to continue learning, I will provide a one-off SkillsFuture Credit top-up of $500 for every Singaporean aged 25 years and above. The top-up will be available for use from 1 October 2020.Unlike the earlier $500 credit which had no expiry date, this top-up will expire in about five years, by end-2025. This is to encourage Singaporeans to take action early to learn new skills and to make the best use of this period of economic slowdown. [Please refer toAnnex B-2.]Second, we want to enhance the role of enterprises in developing their staff.Enterprises know best the skills needed for their business to transform, and can play a key role in helping their workers learn and apply new skills. By investing in their staff, they build a stronger workforce, which can in turn help enterprises succeed. So, we must strive to achieve this virtuous cycle.A good example is Containers Printers, a local food packaging company. It has adopted digital technology and trained its workers to take on higher value-added roles like real-time monitoring of production.In our unique tripartite model, the Labour Movement plays a crucial role. We cannot keep jobs, enterprises, or even industries that are no longer viable. Instead, we refresh, retrain and rejuvenate for the long term.For example, the United Workers of Electronics and Electrical Industries and Thales, a French technology leader, have set up a Company Training Committee. Management staff and union members are working together to develop training plans and deepen skills, so that workers can take on better jobs. On my visit to Thales, I was very heartened to hear how its employees are upskilling and contributing to Thales’ transformation. This is a good example of how unions and enterprises can work together to keep workers up to date as enterprises transform. [Please refer to Annex B-4.]Let me outline five measures to enhance the role of our enterprises in the Next Bound of SkillsFuture.First, I will introduce a new SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit to encourage employers to embark on the transformation of their workforce and enterprise in tandem. Employers can use this enterprise credit to defray 90% of out-of-pocketcosts of business transformation, job redesign and skills training. The SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit, at $10,000 per enterprise, will benefit over 35,000 enterprises, most of which will be SMEs.Second, we will also provide more support for job redesign. The Productivity Solutions Grant supports enterprises to adopt pre-approved digital solutions and equipment. We will expand the Productivity Solutions Grant to include job redesign consultancy services.Third, we will work with large anchor enterprises to support training for their sectors and value chain partners. Anchor enterprises are supported by many SMEs. By helping to raise the skills of workers in these SMEs, the entire supply chain benefits. We aim to partner up to 40 of such anchor enterprises to benefit 4,000 SMEs over the next five years.Fourth, our IHLs will work with more enterprises to enable local students to learn in a real work setting, through SkillsFuture Work-Study Programmes. We will now more than double the capacity of these programmes by 2025. Our aim is to make this a mainstream pathway, with 12% of each cohort going through these pathways, up from 3.5% today.Fifth, as more enterprises train their workers, we will deepen workplace learning capabilities. MOE launched the National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning, or NACE, at Nanyang Polytechnic in July 2018. MOE will expand NACE to two more IHLs over the next few years and aim to benefit over 1,200 enterprises, especially our SMEs.In line with our focus on the role of industry in SkillsFuture, we will also recalibrate Government funding towards training providers and courses with a stronger link to job and wage outcomes.The third element in the Next Bound of SkillsFuture is a special focus on mid-career workers currently in their 40s and 50s. Born in the 1960s and 1970s, they grew up in a time when our economy was just starting to take off. When they started work, it was normal, even celebrated, to stay with one job, in one company, for life. As enterprises restructure, the nature of jobs has changed. Many have adapted to these changes, picked up new skills, and even switched careers.Ms Ng Lee Chun, 50, is one of them. After leaving her previous job, WSG helped her to secure a logistics role with ST Logistics. Through the Professional Conversion Programme for Supply Chain Professionals, ST Logistics sent her for training for this role.Some workers in their 40s and 50s have not seen any job or career changes since leaving school, or had the chance to upskill earlier. But, they are now facing greater competition, from younger workers and workers overseas. I understand their anxiety.At the same time, with broader global shifts, exciting jobs will emerge. Our mid-career workers can seize these opportunities and do better for themselves and their families. The Government will do more to support them.We will introduce a new SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package for locals in their 40s and 50s, to help them stay employable and move on to new jobs or new roles. We aim to double the annual job placement of locals in their 40s and 50s, to around 5,500, by the year 2025. To reach this goal, we will increase the capacity of reskilling programmes. These will include the Professional Conversion Programme under the Adapt and Grow initiative, career transition programmes delivered by Continuing Education and Training Centres, or CET Centres, like IHLs, and sector-specific programmes like the TechSkills Accelerator Company-Led Training for ICT jobs.In tandem, our employers must step up to recruit, retain and retrain our local mid-career workers. We will support them to do so. I will provide a hiring incentive to employers who hire local jobseekers aged 40 and above through a reskilling programme. For each eligible worker, the Government will provide 20% salary support to the employer for six months, capped at $6,000 in total.In parallel, we will streamline our manpower schemes, including support for hiring and retention, to maximise their impact.To improve access to reskilling programmes, I will also provide a special SkillsFuture Credit top-up of $500 to every Singaporean aged 40 to 60 in 2020. This will be over and above the top-up that I announced earlier.This additional credit can be used for selected reskilling programmes at CET Centres.Like the broad-based top-up, this additional credit will expire in about five years, to encourage early action.Apart from Government support, we will assemble a group of volunteer Career Advisors from professional communities. These advisors will provide peer-level support and career guidance to local workers in navigating professional pathways.We hope that all these initiatives will provide meaningful support to those in their 40s and 50s to further their careers with confidence. Lifelong learning and contribution does not stop at the 40s and 50s. As the Chinese say, \"活到老，学到老\". You are never too old to learn.As our people live longer, we will provide more support to help them remain active and contribute to our society and economy. Many seniors have told us that they want to continue working and learning. Besides saving more for retirement, it is about a sense of agency and purpose, and staying active and connected.The Government has strongly supported enterprises that employ our seniors through the Special Employment Credit or SEC, the Additional SEC or ASEC and WorkPro.For our seniors who wish to work longer, earn more and save more, the Prime Minister had announced at last year’s National Day Rally that we are raising the Retirement and Re-employment Ages. We are also increasing the CPF contribution rates for workers aged 55 to 70.To ease in these changes for employers and workers, I will introduce a Senior Worker Support Package comprising four measures.First, I will refashion SEC and ASEC into a Senior Employment Credit, which will take effect from 2021. Like SEC and ASEC, this Senior Employment Credit will provide employers with wage offsets when they hire Singaporean workers aged 55 and above, with the support levels tapering down over time as the Retirement and Re-employment Ages are gradually raised.Second, when employer CPF contribution rates go up in 2021, we will provide employers with aCPF Transition Offset for the year,to offset half of the increase in employer contributions.Third, we will introduce the Senior Worker Early Adopter Grant to support enterprises that raise their own Retirement and Re-employment ages ahead of the legislated changes.Fourth, we will introduce the Part-Time Re‑employment Grant to support and encourage enterprises to formalise part-time re-employment provisions. [Please refer toAnnex B-3.]In short, even as we support workers' aspirations to work longer, we hear employers' concerns. As part of our unique tripartite system, the Government has stepped up to support both our workers and our enterprises.Even for seniors who choose to retire, but wish to continue to learn and stay active, the $500 SkillsFuture Credit top-up that I just announced will support this. Retirees can use this to deepen their interests, or even to explore a whole new area – be it cooking or coding.For many years now, foreign workers have been part of our workforce. With our declining local labour force growth, foreign workers are a necessary complement. But we must regulate the inflow carefully, in a way that creates opportunities for our locals.One area of particular concern is S Passes. These are skilled jobs, many of which can be done by locals, such as Polytechnic diploma holders. We created the S Pass category because despite our best efforts, we are not producing enough of such skilled locals. S Passes enable enterprises to top up their workforce with more skilled workers and to recruit workers with particular skills that locals may lack. But S Passes should not be a means by which enterprises hire low‑cost foreign workers, when qualified locals are available.Last year, we announced cuts for the Dependency Ratio Ceiling, or DRC, and S Pass sub-DRC thresholds for the Services sector. This was to manage manpower growth, and encourage our enterprises to restructure and reskill our local workers.We have been monitoring the manpower growth closely. The number of S Pass holders in the Construction, Manufacturing, Marine Shipyard, and Process sectors is growing, by 3.8% per year over the last two years. The number could increase significantly over the next few years, as the Construction and Marine Shipyard sectors recover and the Process sector begins work on projects in the pipeline.However, the growth in S Pass holders must be sustainable. The Government has been working closely with industry and educational institutions to build up a pipeline of local manpower, including mid-career workers. We want them to have fair opportunities to grow, while supporting the manpower needs of enterprises.Therefore, this year, we will take further steps. We will reduce the S Pass sub‑DRCs of the Construction, Marine Shipyard and Process sectors from 20% to 15%.We will phase in the cuts in two steps. The first step from 20% to 18% on 1 January 2021 and subsequently to 15% on 1 January 2023. We are announcing the changes about a year ahead, to give time for enterprises to adapt.Given the economic uncertainties, we will not reduce the S Pass sub-DRC for the Manufacturing sector at this point. But, we do want manufacturing companies to make the effort to recruit local skilled workers and technicians too. Therefore, when conditions allow, we intend to tighten the S Pass sub-DRC for Manufacturing too.At the same time, we recognise potential concerns of enterprises about the availability of skilled manpower in these sectors.To help you find skilled local graduates looking to embark on their careers and older local professionals looking for new careers, SSG and WSG will work with you to improve matching.Enterprises that have specific needs can continue to apply for additional manpower flexibilities in exceptional cases, through schemes such as the Lean Enterprise Development Scheme.In view of the economic conditions, I will maintain the foreign worker levy rates for all sectors for 2020. [Please refer to Annex B-2.]Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government appreciates the concerns of our workers and enterprises. In the immediate term, we are facing headwinds with the shocks and uncertainties. But in the medium term, we are facing deep structural shifts in the global economy. We have to tackle both challenges head-on.The Government will support our enterprises and workers with the near-term challenges, through the Stabilisation and Support Package for workers and enterprises.To tackle medium-term challenges, our Transformation and Growth strategy will support efforts to deepen enterprise capabilities, develop our people and forge stronger partnerships, through our tripartite structure.By positioning Singapore as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise, we can ride on the next wave of structural changes resolutely. The respective Ministers will provide more details of the schemes I have mentioned in this section later.Mr Speaker, Sir, a vibrant economy provides good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans, and allows families to do well. It also gives us the resources to support our people with their needs, to build a caring and inclusive home.Our tax and spending policies reflect our values. Over the past decade, we have significantly increased our social spending. Between 2010 and 2019, we tripled our healthcare expenditure from $4 billion to about $12 billion a year,to meet the growing needs of our seniors and to ensure that every Singaporean has access to affordable and quality healthcare.We increased our investments in education, from $10 billion to about $13 billion, so that all Singaporeans will have the best chance to fulfil their fullest potential.We increased the expenditure on national development from $2.4 billion to $3.6 billion, with the bulk of this going into subsidies on public housing, so that every Singaporean household can have a home to call their own.Last year, we gave out about $1.1 billion in cash to Singaporeans who need more help. The payouts were provided through structural schemes such as ComCare for the vulnerable, Workfare Income Supplement for lower-wage workers, GST Voucher – Cash for lower income Singaporeans and Silver Support for the vulnerable elderly.This social spending reflects our commitment to invest in our people, to give every citizen a stake in our society, to care for our seniors and to provide more help to those with less.This Budget, we will continue to care for Singaporeans in the following ways: first, we will build on our efforts to support our families; second, we will support and enable our seniors in their retirement years; and third, we will promote a stronger giving culture.I will first touch on how we willfurther support our families.Good education provides a strong foundation for children to grow, realise their aspirations and continue a journey of lifelong learning. We have committed to decisive shifts in the Government’s support for early childhood development. We are determined to give every child, regardless of circumstances, a good start in life.As the Prime Minister announced at the National Day Rally last year, we will step up efforts to improve the affordability, accessibility and quality of pre-school services. We have significantly enhanced pre-school subsidies and made them available to more families from this year. We will also increase the share of Government-supported pre-school places from just over 50% today, to 80% by around 2025.Overall, we are doubling our support for our young in their pre-school years. In 2018, the Government spent about $1 billion on the early childhood sector. Within the next few years, this will double to over $2 billion per year.In the Primary to pre-University school years, education is already heavily subsidised for Singaporeans. Primary school is free for all Singaporeans, while the Secondary school fee is $5 a month. Students pay only a few dollars of miscellaneous fees.For students from lower income families, we will provide further help. We will enhance the MOE Financial Assistance Schemeby raising the annual bursary quantum for pre-university students, from $900 to $1,000. We will also increase transport subsidies for all students and school meals subsidies for Secondary school students. The enhanced Financial Assistance Scheme willcost an additional $9 million per year, or a total of $52 million per year.We announced that we would enhance bursaries for diploma and degree holders last year. These bursaries are on top of subsidies that are provided to all Singaporeans.Starting from Academic Year 2020, students from lower and middle income families in the Polytechnics and Autonomous Universities can benefit from higher bursaries.We will also enhance bursaries for full-time ITE students from Academic Year 2020. Students from households who qualify under the lowest income tier for the bursaries will now receive 100% fee subsidy on top of the cash bursary. Students from low- and middle-income households will also benefit from an increase in the cash bursary quantum by up to $200 a year.Thecost of bursaries for higher education will rise from $148 million per year to $198 million per year.A good education lays a strong foundation for a better future. This is why this Government has been providing significant education subsidies for each child. A Singaporean child will receive over $180,000 of education subsidies in total by the time he turns 16. This includes about $50,000 in Government subsidies over five years when they enrol in a full-day childcare programme with one of the Anchor Operators.For those who come from less-privileged backgrounds, there are additional subsidies for pre-school, bursaries and other financial assistance schemes. This substantial investment is how we maximise every child's potential, regardless of family circumstances. This is a promise that I, as a former Education Minister and now Finance Minister, am committed to keep.When Singaporeans are ready to start a family and own a home, we make sure that there is good access to quality and affordable housing. Last year, MND consolidated existing housing grants into the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant. With the Enhanced Housing Grant, first-time flat buyers can now enjoy up to $160,000 in housing grants. The monthly household income ceilings for subsidised flats and executive condominiums were raised to $14,000 and $16,000 respectively. We expect around 16,000 HDB households to benefit from these enhancements each year.The Government has made significant moves to help Singaporeans manage major expenditures in life, through structural subsidies in education, healthcare and housing.This year, with the economic slowdown and the uncertainties of the COVID-19 outbreak, we are mindful that many families are facing greater pressures.During my fellow Members of Parliament and my own walkabouts, people often tell us that they are worried about job security and rising expenditures.To help all Singaporeans with their household expenses during this period of uncertainty, I will provide a comprehensive Care and Support Packagefor households, amounting to about $1.6 billion.All Singaporeans aged 21 and above in 2020, will receive a one‑off cash payout of $300, $200 or $100, depending on their income.The annual GST Voucher – U-Save provides rebates to help HDB households with their utilities expenses. This year, I will double the amount of U-Save rebates through a one-off GST Voucher – U-Save Special Payment to all eligible HDB households. This will help to free up cash for other household expenses.In addition, I will extend the Service and Conservancy Charges Rebate by another year. Eligible HDB households will receive rebates of between one and a half and three and a half months.Lower income Singaporeans will get additional help with their daily living expenses. In October 2019, we announced the Workfare Transport Concession Scheme and the Public Transport Voucherto help cushion the transport fare increases for lower income households. To further offset daily living expenses for lower income workers, I will provide a Workfare Special Payment. Singaporeans on Workfare will receive 20% more for work done in 2019, with a minimum payment of $100. This will be given in cash.I will also help needy Singaporeans more directly. They will receive Grocery Vouchersworth $100 each year in 2020 and 2021, for use at major supermarkets. This directly helps needy households with one of their majorcost of living items – food.There will be additional help for families taking care of children and elderly parents. I will provide a further $100 cash payout for every adult Singaporean with at least one Singaporean child aged 20 years and below this year.I will provide an additional GST Voucher – U‑Saverebate for larger households with five or more members, to help them with their utilities bills. Together with the U-Save Special Payment I mentioned earlier, larger households can receive a total of 2.5 times their regular U-Save rebates this year. These households can receive up to $1,000 in U-Save rebates, depending on their flat type.I will also provide a $100 top-up to the PAssion Card to all Singaporeans aged 50 years and above this year, including the Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation seniors. This can be used to pay for groceries, activities and facilities at Community Clubs and more. Those who do not currently have a PAssion Card can get one for free to receive the top-up.Our Self-Help Groups have also been working closely with the community to help needy families and children. To enable them to do more, I will provide a $10 million grant to them over two years so that they can help more families.The Community Development Councils or CDCs have also played an important role in partnering the community to strengthen bonds and help vulnerable groups.Each CDC has its set of local assistance schemes to meet local needs and programmes that allow community members to help those with extra needs.I will provide $20 million for the CDCs to do more and better meet the needs of their residents through local initiatives.Together, the Care and Support Package will provide a young family with about $1,300. A 3-Generation family can receive more – about $1,800. More details are provided in the slide and in the Annex. [Please refer toAnnex C-1.]Let me now move on to the second area, which is to support and enable our seniors.Singaporeans are living longer. Our life expectancy at birth is close to 85 years, the longest in the world. This is a good thing!Singapore will not just be a great place to raise a family, but a great place for seniors to live a life of purpose, dignity and contribution.The Community Networks for Seniors is now a national programme, with 650 active ageing nodes to engage our seniors. We must see ageing as a positive force and turn this phase of life into a time of opportunity. Ageing with confidence includes having financial assurance in retirement. This can be achieved through a combination of individual effort, family, community and Government support.Over the years, we have strengthened the four pillars of our social security system – home ownership, CPF, healthcare assurance and income from Workfare and Silver Support. We have also been enhancing the ComCare schemes, which support Singaporeans who are unable to work and have little or no family support.The CPF is a major scheme to enable Singaporeans to save enough for their retirement years. We need to keep on updating and improving our CPF policies over time, so that they remain appropriate for each cohort.We have been adjusting the Basic Retirement Sum, or BRS, regularly, in line with rising income levels. Since 2017, household incomes per capita have risen by an average of 4.1% per year in nominal terms, while the BRS has increased by 3% per year. The BRS is currently $90,500 for the cohort turning 55 this year.We will continue to adjust the BRS by the same 3% per year for the next two cohorts. The BRS will be $93,000 for cohorts turning 55 in 2021 and $96,000 for those turning 55 in 2022. These modest continuing adjustments are necessary for the payouts to keep up with basic retirement expenses.With continuing wage growth, each successive cohort has been able to save more. We expect seven in 10 actively employed persons from these two cohorts to be able to set aside their BRS, significantly more than four in 10 about a decade ago. More details are in the Annex. [Please refer toAnnex C-2.]Even as more seniors are prepared for retirement, one group of current seniors may not be able to meet their retirement needs.When they were younger, they earned less than working Singaporeans do today, even after adjusting for inflation. Some may have earned lower wages for most of their working lives. Others may have stopped working early to take care of family members. We are in a fortunate position that most of our seniors have housing assets that they can use to support their retirement, if they wish.We will do more to help Singaporeans tap their housing assets for retirement by enhancing the Silver Housing Bonus and the Lease Buyback Scheme. The Minister for National Development will provide more details.The CPF is a good retirement scheme, based on personal savings. It provides Singaporeans with very favourable, risk-free interest rates on their savings. Many Singaporeans want to top up their own, their spouse’s, or parents’ CPF accounts. In 2019, such voluntary cash top-ups added up to about $1 billion. We would like to encourage more to do so, particularly those whose CPF balances are on the low side.To help those with less CPF savings to save more, I will introduce a Matched Retirement Savings Schemefrom 2021 to 2025.Lower to middle income Singaporeans aged 55 to 70 who have not been able to set aside the prevailing BRS will be eligible. Under this scheme, the Government will match every dollar of cash top‑up made to their CPF Retirement Account, up to an annual cap of $600. This is a way of encouraging and augmenting family support for our seniors with fewer means in retirement. About 435,000 Singaporeans will be eligible.While the CPF is a good scheme, for a small segment of the elderly population, it will not be enough. Some had low incomes during their working years and currently have little or no family support. We created the Silver Support Scheme to complement the CPF for this group and give them more financial security in retirement. The scheme is now almost five years old and a review is timely.Silver Support currently provides cash payouts to the bottom 20% of Singaporeans aged 65 and above, with some support for those slightly above the bottom 20%.I will raise the quarterly cash payouts by 20%. For individuals living in smaller flats, this means that the cash payouts will increase from $750 to $900 per quarter.I will also broaden the eligibility criteria of Silver Support. I will expand the threshold for lifetime wages and per capita household income to cover more seniors. There will also be anew payout tierto provide a smaller payout to seniors whose monthly household incomes per person are above $1,300 but not exceeding $1,800 – these seniors do not receive Silver Support today. There is no need to apply – eligible seniors will be notified by CPF Board and start receiving payouts under the enhanced scheme from December 2020.Overall, we expect about 100,000 more seniors to benefit from the enhanced Silver Support in 2021. Thecost of Silver Support will nearly double, from today’s $330 million, to around $620 million in 2021. More details are provided in the Annex. [Please refer toAnnex C-3.]Here is an illustration of how the matched savings, right-sizing and enhanced Silver Support can add up to help a retired 65-year-old couple to more than double their retirement income. I will pause here for Members to take a look at the example and details are in the Annex. [Please refer toAnnex C-4.]These enhancements underscore the Government’s commitment to provide seniors with greater assurance in retirement and reflect the values we hold dear, such as taking care of our parents and seniors. They will also complement the other schemes for our seniors, such asthe Pioneer Generation Package and Merdeka Generation Package.We will also help seniors stay active and contribute to the community. Many senior volunteers find that volunteering gives them purpose, keeps them socially connected and promotes active ageing. The community also benefits from their wealth of experience and skills.There is Mr Victor Lim, a 70-year-old retiree, who spent 40 years in the Medical Imaging and IT industry and now volunteers at IMDA's Digital Readiness programmes. There is also Mdm Leong Su Yin, one of the oldest members of RSVP, who has been volunteering for over 20 years.Our success in taking care of every Singaporean, from pre-school to retirement, is only possible with the support of our community partners. This brings me to the third strategy – Strengthening the Giving Culture.When we harness and rally greater participation and resources from the community, we can better support those in need. The Government will continue to support the community in building a stronger giving culture.Last year, I announced the Bicentennial Community Fund, which provides dollar-for-dollar matching for donations made to Institutions of a Public Character. This is on top of the 250% tax deduction provided for donations made to IPCs.One of the potential beneficiaries is the Daughters Of Tomorrow Limited, which helps disadvantaged women gain new skills and find employment. The organisation plans to use the Bicentennial Community Fund to develop staff and volunteers and build their in-house fundraising capabilities.This year, MSF and the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) will set up the Community Capability Trust to fundraise and support our social service sector partners in enhancing their capabilities and capacities to serve the community.For a start, together with Tote Board, we will provide $200 million to the trust in FY2020 and match up to $150 million in funds raised over the next 10 years. In total, we will commit up to $350 million for the Community Capability Trust.This will provide a pool of funds that our Social Service Agencies can tap on to transform themselves for the future. I hope they will make good use of this to strengthen their organisational capabilities, become more productive and enhance their service infrastructure, in partnership with MSF and NCSS.Just like how our efforts in the Industry Transformation Maps have positioned our enterprises and economy for the future, the Community Capability Trust will equip Social Service Agencies to bring the social sector forward. Details are in the Annex. [Please refer toAnnex C-5.]There is much value to be gained when a community comes together in support of a cause. I am happy to see the success of movements like The Purple Parade, The Purple Symphony and Runninghour. These are ground-up initiatives that support inclusion and celebrate the abilities of persons with special needs, through activities like music and sports. Everyone can play a part to build an inclusive society from their hearts, in ways big and small.Many enterprises have also built inclusive workspaces for persons with disabilities (PwDs). To support the employment of PwDs, the Special Employment Credit (SEC) and the Additional Special Employment Credit (ASEC) schemes provide wage offsets for employers hiring Singaporean PwDs earning below $4,000 a month. At the last Budget, we extended the SEC and ASEC until the end of 2020.We have received good feedback on the schemes in supporting PwD employment. In 2018, more than 5,700 employers hiring over 8,600 Singaporean PwDs benefited from SEC.This Budget, we will introduce the new Enabling Employment Credit, or EEC, to provide stronger support for employers of PwDs. The new EEC will replace the current SEC and ASEC schemes for PwD employment. It will be available for five years, from 2021 to 2025, at acost of about $31 million per year.To ensure that the EEC remains helpful for PwDs to find employment and remain in the workforce, the Government will review the EEC after two years and make adjustments if necessary.This Budget, I will also top up three funds that provide targeted help for the elderly and the lower income. I will provide top-ups of$750 million to the ElderCare Fund, $500 million to the ComCare Fund and $200 million to the MediFund. These funds provide a safety net for the low-income by helping them to meet their daily expenses and healthcare fees.The respective Ministers will provide more details of the schemes I have mentioned in this section later.Mr Speaker, Sir, Budget 2020 supports the Government’s long-term strategy of building a caring and inclusive society.We will continue to support our families through the enhancements to our education and housing schemes, and the Care and Support Package for households. We will enable our seniors by promoting active ageing and providing financial assurance in their retirement years. We will also partner the community to build a stronger giving culture so that we can better support those in need.This is our continued effort to improve the lives of our people and our future generations. We must continue to work together to build a society where opportunities are available to every Singaporean, at every stage of life.Let me move on to how we can sustain Singapore’s success for generations to come.Our Pioneers set out to build a high quality living environment, even when they had to attend to pressing economic and security challenges. They left us a legacy of a clean, green and liveable environment. As the Chinese saying goes, \"前人种树，后人乘凉\". The generation that planted the seeds does not fully benefit from their toil, but they care to do this, for future generations to reap the fruits. In the same spirit, we must plant the seeds to secure a better future for generations to come.By thinking long term, by confronting major challenges and by investing for our future, we have beaten the odds. Three major challenges we must continue to confront are: climate change, security and fiscal sustainability.To build a liveable and sustainable home, we must address climate change. As a low-lying island nation, rising sea levels threaten our very existence. So, what can we do as a small island nation?First, we must continue to support global efforts to combat global problems. Singapore must continue to do our part as a responsible member of the international community. Singapore plays an active role at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Besides representing our interests, Team Singapore is regarded as an honest broker, helping to build bridges and consensus.This year, we will update our commitment to the Paris Agreement and take a further step to chart our vision for a low-carbon, sustainable future Singapore. The Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office will elaborate on this later.Second, we must manage our transition to a low-carbon, low-emissions economy. We must turn our carbon constraints into a strength, just like how we have turned our water vulnerabilities into an area of strength with radical innovations in NEWater and desalination. Today, Singapore is a global hub of water research and innovation.The circular economy – turning waste into a resource that can be reused in the production cycle – is one way we can reduce our carbon footprint and open up new opportunities. NEA will soon begin a field trial to use NEWSand, made from incineration ash, in road construction along Tanah Merah Coast Road.We will do more to develop new ideas and solutions. We are committing close to $1 billion for research in Urban Solutions and Sustainability. The research will focus on renewable energy, cooling Singapore and carbon capture, among others.As climate change is global, innovative solutions created here can be commercialised, turning our constraints into a strength. More broadly, we have to manage our greenhouse gas emissions, by putting in place the right incentives, tax structures and regulations.We introduced a carbon tax in 2019 and supported enterprises in improving energy efficiency. We introduced and enhanced the Minimum Energy Performance Standards to raise the energy efficiency of energy-intensive household and industrial appliances.The domestic transport sector contributes a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICEs) also contribute to pollution, adversely affecting our health and quality of life.Many major cities have already set ambitious goals to phase out ICE vehicles and shift to cleaner technologies. Car manufacturers are actively developing cleaner engine technologies, such as hybrids and electric vehicles, or EVs, and are exploring new areas, such as hydrogen fuel cells.As a small city-state, we are able, and have strong reason, to stay abreast of these major technological changes. For both public health and climate change reasons, we should progressively phase out the use of ICE vehicles towards cleaner alternatives, such as hybrids and EVs. We will set a long-term strategic goal for Singapore to achieve this.Our vision is to phase out ICE vehicles and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040. To promote this, we will have three measures in this Budget.First, we will enhance incentives to encourage the adoption of cleaner and more environmentally friendly vehicles.In 2018, we introduced the Vehicular Emissions Scheme for cars and taxis. Under the scheme, car buyers and taxi operators who choose cleaner car models can receive an upfront rebate of up to $20,000 and $30,000 respectively. We have seen promising results from the scheme. More car buyers and taxi operators are choosing environmentally friendly engines, such as electric hybrids.Therefore, we will introduce a similar scheme called the Commercial Vehicle Emissions Scheme for light goods vehicles. The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources will announce the details at the Committee of Supply (COS).For cars and taxis, I will provide an additional EV Early Adoption Incentive. Those who purchase fully electric cars and taxis will receive a rebate of up to 45% on the Additional Registration Fee, capped at $20,000.We will also revise the road tax methodology for carsto better reflect the current trends in vehicle efficiency from January 2021. This will lead to an across-the-board reduction in road tax for EVs and some hybrids. [Please refer toAnnex D-1.]Second, we willexpand the public charging infrastructure for EVs. Today, there are about 1,600 charging points island-wide. We will work with the private sector to step up the deployment of chargers in public carparks. By 2030, we aim to deploy up to 28,000 chargers at our public carparks island-wide.Lastly, the Government will take the lead. We will progressively procure and use cleaner vehicles to do our part for the environment. Here, we are placing a significant bet on EVs and leaning policy in that direction because it is the most promising technology. It also requires a significant increase in demand to justify the infrastructure investment. This is a significant undertaking involving multiple agencies.The transition towards EVs will have a major impact on tax revenues. Fuel excise duties today yield around $1 billion per year and are significant contributors to Government revenues. They are also a form of mileage tax, which discourages excessive driving, especially in private cars, and thus helps to reduce road congestion.But EVs do not pay fuel excise duties. Therefore, we will need to update our vehicular tax structure to preserve these two considerations.Ideally, we would like to implement a usage-based tax on EVs as an alternative to fuel excise duties. But the technology to do this properly on EVs is the Next Generation ERP System, and distance‑based charging using ERP is still several years away. In the interim, we will impose a lump-sum tax that will be built into the road tax schedule for EVs to partly account for the loss in fuel excise duties.This lump-sum tax will be phased in over three years starting from January 2021, with the full quantum implemented by January 2023. [Please refer to Annex D-1.]Total road tax, after the revision in methodology and the new lump-sum tax, will be higher for some EV models.However, EV buyers can expect to enjoy substantialcost savings because of the significant EV Early Adoption Incentive.I spoke about policy measures that the Government will put in place to reduce emissions. But the Government alone cannot address the threat of climate change. Therefore, mobilising all of us in this effort is the third thrust of our climate change strategy.Robert Swan, the first person to have walked to the North and South Poles, once said, \"The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it.\"To deal with climate change, we have to foster a climate of change in our community – where everyone, whether as an individual, as a business leader or as a community leader, makes conscious decisions to lower our carbon footprint.One such decision by individuals is our choice of household appliances. To encourage households to purchase energy-efficient household appliances, we will introduceincentives to help lower income households with thecost of these appliances.Outside our homes, we earlier announced plans to add more greenery to our HDB estates. New housing developments will have around 45% to 60% green cover.Residents are contributing through the community garden movement. Today, more than 36,000 gardening enthusiasts are nurturing over 1,500 community gardens island-wide. These gardens keep our shared neighbourhood vibrant and bring people closer together.To make sustainable living a key feature of our HDB estates, we will have a new HDB Green Towns Programme. It will have three key focus areas: reducing energy consumption, recycling rainwater and cooling our HDB towns.I spoke about how we are committing to global efforts, managing our carbon constraints and building a sustainable Singapore, together. We must try hard and we will do our part. But the course of climate change depends on the commitment of all nations. The risk of rising sea levels remains significant. So, our fourth strategic thrust is to prepare our island for rising sea levels.The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources will elaborate on our immediate plans at theCOS.The Prime Minister mentioned at the National Day Rally last year that climate change adaptation mightcost $100 billion or more over 100 years. This is a major fiscal outlay in the coming years. So, it is right and prudent that we set aside resources for this.I will set up a new Coastal and Flood Protection Fund, with an initial injection of $5 billion. I will top it up subsequently whenever our fiscal situation allows.We must have the resolve to deal head-on with the existential threat of rising sea levels. Just as our pioneers planted the trees for us to enjoy today, we must protect our island for future generations to come.Our food security may also come under threat, as imported supplies come under strain from climate change or geopolitical tensions. To improve our food resilience, the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources will provide more details of our \"Grow Local\" strategy at theCOSto pursue our \"30/30\" aspirations.Sir, you see, MOE has a \"70/70\" goal and MEWR has a \"30/30\" goal. So, together we have 100/100! [Laughter.]In uncertain times, there are many calls on our Budget. However, we cannot take our peace, prosperity and stability for granted. As a small city-state, we are particularly vulnerable to volatilities in our external environment. Securing our home remains a high priority in our Budget and must be funded adequately. It is imperative that we continue to invest in our external, internal, cyber and data security, to keep Singapore and our families safe and secure.Diplomacy and deterrence are the twin pillars of maintaining Singapore's sovereignty. We strive to build good relations with our neighbours and international partners and to promote a rules-based world order. A strong Singapore Armed Forces supports our diplomatic efforts and ensures that other countries take Singapore seriously. We must be ever-ready to defend our interests should negotiations fail.We must continue to draw a credible deterrence, by maintaining our military and technological edge, in a prudent manner that stretches every defence dollar.Back home, we are committed to protecting our safety and our way of life. Our Home Team agencies will continue to enhance the operational readiness of their officers, leverage technology and build partnerships with the community. Singaporeans share a strong conviction to look out for each other and to partner the Home Team to prevent and deal with terror threats and crisis, through the SGSecure movement.We must also be prepared to deal with cyber threats, as digitalisation becomes more pervasive. Our cyber capabilities have been raised significantly, with the setting up of the Cyber Security Agency, or CSA, in 2015 and the passing of the Cybersecurity Act in 2018.CSA is preparing measures for the next level of cybersecurity, as we adopt more advanced technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, Cloud and the Internet of Things. All of us, in the Government, enterprises and as individuals, will need to stay vigilant and strengthen our cyber and data security capabilities.Data security is also a vital prerequisite and key enabler of Singapore's Digital Economy. It is key to preserving trust in a digitally-connected world.We enacted the Personal Data Protection Act in 2012 and the Public Service has adopted comprehensive measures to secure and protect citizens’ data. As we embark on initiatives to realise our Smart Nation ambitions, we must continue to enhance our cyber capabilities.I will set aside $1 billion over the next three years to build up the Government's cyber and data security capabilities to safeguard citizens’ data and our critical information infrastructure systems.The respective Ministers will provide more details of the schemes to confront the challenges of climate change and security.As we lay out our plans for our economy, people and environment, we must ensure these plans are fiscally sustainable, so that we have the resources to deal with future needs and challenges. We must continue to plan our finances based on long-term structural drivers.Revenue flows are difficult to project accurately – we can end up having more, or less. In this term of Government, we happen to have more, mainly due to exceptional Statutory Board contributions from MAS and increased stamp duty collections. We used some of the unexpected surpluses to save ahead for anticipated needs and shared some of the surpluses with Singaporeans.But we must not count on such revenue surprises to keep happening. We must anticipate long-term spending needs and be disciplined to raise revenues ahead of time, so that we can continue to provide quality public services to all Singaporeans. At the same time, we must be mindful of the uncertainties and downside risks to our revenue. There are on-going discussions to revise international tax rules under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project and we are actively participating in them.Our fiscal strategy must also be equitable. Major long-term infrastructure is lumpy and requires hefty upfront investments. But once built, they benefit many generations of Singaporeans. Borrowing for such developments allows us to distribute thecost equitably across current and future generations, without the need for sharp increases in taxes.However, we must remain disciplined about our use of borrowing. We should continue to pay for recurrent needs, like healthcare expenditure, through recurrent revenues such as taxes. Our fiscal discipline has helped us to be among a select group of countries with a triple-A credit rating. This in turn lowers the borrowingcosts of enterprises and households, and promotes a virtuous cycle of economic growth.We must also maintain our fiscal posture and leave enough to deal with unexpected shocks and longer term challenges.The Constitution requires us to run a balanced budget over each term of Government. We are being prudent to preserve fiscal buffers, to ensure that we have the wherewithal to stand our ground and bounce back quickly if the tide turns against us. This is how we have been able to respond decisively to fight the COVID-19 outbreak and support Singaporeans and our workers. And at the same time, to be able to set aside an Assurance Package for GST to help Singaporeans in the years ahead.The accumulated surpluses at the end of the term of Government becomes part of our past reserves, which are invested. Today, the Net Investment Returns Contribution from our reserves is the biggest component of our revenue. This is remarkable for a country with no natural resources of any kind.I am making further changes to our tax system to strengthen its resilience while maintaining competitiveness. The details are in the Annex. [Please refer to Annex D-1.]Let me summarise our overall Budget position.For FY2019, we expect an overall budget deficit of $1.7 billion, or 0.3% of GDP. This deficit is $1.8 billion lower than the $3.5 billion deficit forecasted a year ago. This is due mainly to lower-than-expected expenditures arising from unforeseen project delays.When we exclude the Government’s top-ups to funds and Net Investment Returns Contribution from our reserves, we expect a basic deficit of $5.1 billion, or 1% of GDP.In the coming year, the Singapore economy faces considerable uncertainty, because of heightened risks in the global economy, and the rapidly evolving COVID-19 outbreak. Hence, for FY2020, our budget position will be more expansionary, with a larger basic deficit of $12.3 billion. This, together with the Stabilisation and Support Package, will impart a considerable fiscal boost to the economy to address near-term concerns.On the whole, we expect an overall deficit of $10.9 billion or 2.1% of GDP. [Please refer toAnnex D-2.]With our fiscal prudence since the beginning of this term of Government, we have sufficient accumulated fiscal surplus to fund the overall deficit in FY2020. There is no draw on past reserves.Members have been very patient and this is my third file. It is almost two hours now, so, thank you very much. Before I start on the third file, some good news. My very dedicated Staff in MOF who worked day and night with me, over the weekends and Chinese New Year, managed to trim and trim the speech and grow and grow the substance. So, the substance has grown, but, the speech is more concise now. We have moved all the details to the Annexes. It is a pity because there were so many inspiring stories that I wanted to share with you, but I hope that they will find many opportunities to share these stories. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me thank my excellent Staff for contributing to a significant improvement in our productivity here.Mr Speaker, Sir, we will face more complex challenges ahead, but we are in this for the long haul. We can succeed only if we work together.Our on-going fight against the COVID-19 outbreak is a testament to how we can work together. Our healthcare workers and frontline officers are giving their all to keep us safe, and care for those who are unwell. And others – community groups, enterprises and many volunteers have stepped forward. Everyone has something to offer and every action makes a difference.This is the spirit of the Singapore Together movement, which I launched last June – to build a democracy of deeds, mobilise the creative energies and commitment of Singaporeans, find common cause and beat the odds together, to build our future Singapore.We made a concerted effort to involve Singaporeans and stakeholders in our strategic deliberations and budgeting process. Over the course of the Budget 2020 consultations, my colleagues and I met almost 1,000 leaders from different parts of society, including our unions, enterprises, social sector and youths. It was a very enriching experience for everyone and I thank every participant. Some of you will recognise your ideas in the Budget.For example, we enhanced the internationalisation support schemes after receiving feedback from TACs such as the Singapore Manufacturing Federation and the Association of Banks in Singapore. We provided more resources to support our people to take action to reduce carbon footprint, after several youth leaders I met suggested this. I also thank the talented students from Nanyang Polytechnic for the artistic illustrations in my slides today.Many Singaporeans are coming up with, and acting on, ideas to make Singapore a better place.The youth movement has been particularly strong. In the area of climate change, youths like Ms Cheryl Lee and her team in the Singapore Youth for Climate Action have been organising activities to encourage youth to take action through simple lifestyle choices.Ms Rohini d/o Ravindran is also contributing to the community, by conducting photography and videography sessions for lower income youth, to develop their problem-solving skills and build a good foundation for them to excel.In 2016, we set up the Our Singapore Fund, or OSF, to provide funding support for ground-up efforts in the social domain. Since then, the OSF has committed nearly $4.3 million to support over 240 ground-up projects in culture, heritage, arts and sports.One example is Progress NEST started by Mr Akram Hanif, to support children from low-income families.Through these partnerships, we have been able to do more and do better. And we are committed to making partnerships an integral part of how we will build our future Singapore.I will set aside $250 million to give greater momentum to our partnership efforts. I will top up the OSFand extend the Fund beyond 2020 to support more ground-up initiatives that Singaporeans are passionate about, across a wider range of domains. [Please refer to Annex C-5.]The Government is committed to expanding and scaling up successful ground-up projects, such as those supported by the OSF.MEWR will also be launching an SG Eco Fund to support partnerships with the community and enterprises in our sustainability efforts.Channelling the energies of our people to key causes requires us to identify the challenges of our time. These challenges are multi-faceted and multi-dimensional, but they are ultimately about how Singapore remains exceptional in an increasingly complex world. The solutions will also come in all shapes and forms, from all levels of society – from government policies to individual efforts on the ground. We must overcome these challenges and find solutions together.The Government will work with agencies and key stakeholders to identify major societal challenges. This will help us focus our collective efforts on the challenges that matter and allow us to galvanise good ideas and solutions from the public.We have issued several national innovation challenges to date, in the areas of energy, land and liveability, ageing, urban mobility and AI-enabled healthcare. For example, our AI Healthcare Grand Challenge is drawing strong interest here and with partners from France and Germany.Under the National Innovation Challenge in Ageing, we sought ideas to combine different technologies to enable ageing in place and deployed these solutions at a precinct level.While we are only in our initial phases, we have learnt useful lessons, and seen encouraging results. We will issue more specific challenges to encourage ground-up participation. These include challenges in the social sector, where we have built many community partnerships to better support children from low-income and vulnerable families, and promote youth mental well-being, amongst other things.The respective Ministers will provide more details of the schemes I have mentioned in this section later.I am excited about the prospect of stronger Government-citizen partnerships in overcoming these challenges and look forward to the results that these partnerships will yield. As this Budget has many measures, MOF has prepared a booklet summarising the measures, which I hope colleagues will find useful.With your permission, Mr Speaker, may I ask the Clerks to distribute these to all Members of this House?Mr Speaker: Yes, please. [Handouts were distributed to hon Members.]Mr Heng Swee Keat:Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say a few words in Mandarin before I conclude in English.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]The COVID-19 outbreak has brought about many uncertainties globally. The virus disregards nationalities and the effort to control the disease is a global one.Governments, international organisations, researchers and healthcare workers from many countries are now working closely together. China has taken a series of highly effective measures and an early success of China in fighting COVID-19 will help both China and the world.The current situation has brought about widespread impact to our economy. Some sectors have already been affected, and Singaporeans are worried about their employment prospects, I can understand their concerns.In order to reduce the pressure on businesses and our people, I will introduce a $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package. In order to help Singaporeans meet their daily expenditures, I will also introduce a $1.6 billion Care and Support Package.Singapore has enough resources to meet present challenges. This is because we have been well-prepared accumulating surpluses from this term of Government, in order to meet unexpected expenditures.Whether we can successfully overcome this challenge will depend on whether Singaporeans can look out for each other and maintain social cohesion. When facing the unknown, it is natural that people feel worried.However, we must not panic. We should pay attention to personal hygiene and be considerate towards people around us. At the same time, we must take concrete actions to help those who are in need.The Budget is a long-term strategic plan to ensure that Singapore develops sustainably, and Singaporeans can lead better lives. In overcoming our short-term challenges, we must also pay attention to the long-term structural changes and capture the opportunities brought about by these changes.First, we must continue to encourage enterprises to transform and create more opportunities for Singaporeans. As the saying goes – “there is no end to learning”. Through SkillsFuture, we encourage lifelong learning, which can bring about lifelong benefits. We will introduce the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package to help locals in their 40s and 50s learn new skills and take on new jobs.Second, we will build a caring and inclusive society together. I have just announced that the GST rate will remain at 7% in 2021. However, in order to meet increasing recurrent expenditures, such as in healthcare, the GST increase will still be needed by 2025. When we raise the GST rate, we will continue to help low-income families and provide more support for them. We will provide a $6 billion Assurance Package when the GST rate is raised and enhance the existing permanent GST Voucher scheme.Third, we must continue to develop Singapore, look after Singapore's security and stability, and ensure that we have a sustainable fiscal system. This is our commitment to our future generations. Especially in the area of climate change, I will provide $5 billion to set up a new Coastal and Flood Protection Fund.Fourth, we will work together with Singaporeans to build a nation and home we will always call our own.As the saying goes, \"the young will be educated, those in need will receive support, the old will be cared for\", we hope that Singapore will not only be a good place for raising children, but also a place where our seniors have dignified and meaningful lives.We will enhance our current Silver Support Scheme to help lower income seniors cope with daily expenses, providing them assurance in their retirement.In addition, we will introduce the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to help those who do not have very high CPF balances build up their CPF savings. We also encourage our senior citizens to lead active and fulfilling lives after retirement.At present, the global situation is uncertain and many countries face structural changes. Taking a long-term point of view, dealing with this sudden virus outbreak is only one of the challenges that we will encounter as we go forward. We cannot stagnate because of this. Together, we have to march towards our common objective. In the spirit of the Singapore Together movement, as long as we pool our efforts and work hand-in-hand, we will be able to solve all problems and create an even better Singapore.(In English): I will now conclude in English. Mr Speaker, Sir, there are deep structural shifts taking place in the world today, coupled with near‑term concerns over economic uncertainties and the COVID-19 outbreak. All nations, big or small, will have to devise strategies and mobilise their people to navigate these changes and turbulence.Singaporeans have enjoyed more than half a century of stability and prosperity because we have seized the opportunities from an increasingly open and interconnected world. Every decade or so, when a test comes, we have rallied and passed it together.In this Budget, I have outlined our plans not only to help our people deal with near‑term challenges, but also to better enable Singaporeans of all ages to thrive in the new decade.The Stabilisation and Support Package,costing $4 billion, will help viable enterprises and our workers during these uncertain times. Our Transformation and Growth effort,costing $8.3 billion over three years, will support our longer term plans to position Singapore as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise. The Care and Support Package,costing $1.6 billion, will support our households and alleviate concerns overcost of living. This is on top of the structural social subsidies given to Singaporeans in healthcare, education and housing.We will continue to take steps towards climate change mitigation and adaptation, to ensure that in the decades ahead, our children and children’s children will have a safe and liveable Singapore.I am confident that together, we can ensure that Singapore remains exceptional. As one Singapore, we will grow our economy and transform our enterprises, creating opportunities for Singaporeans. As one Singapore, we will care for and nurture Singaporeans at every stage of their lives, to build a caring and inclusive society. As one Singapore, we will build a liveable and sustainable Singapore in the face of climate change, secure our sovereignty as an independent nation and ensure our fiscal sustainability. And as one Singapore, we will work together with fellow Singaporeans, to build a nation and a home we will always call our own.Our nation has built up the capital – financial, human, and social – to go the distance. The Singapore spirit is strong and growing. Together, we will advance, as One Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. [Applause.]Mr Speaker:The Question is, \"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021.\"In accordance with paragraph (1) of Standing Order No 89, the debate now stands adjourned. Debate to be resumed on what day?Mr Heng Swee Keat: Wednesday, 26 February 2020, Sir.Mr Speaker: So be it."

        "MPs Speaking": "[The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M), Mr Seah Kian Peng, Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade), Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M]",
        "Content": "29Mr Seah Kian Pengasked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources how have the recent fires in Australia affected Singapore’s environment and food security.The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M): Mr Speaker, Singapore’s air quality was not affected by the recent fires in Australia as winds over Singapore were not blown from the Australian region. From November 2019 to January 2020, when the fires took place, air quality in Singapore was mostly in the \"Good\" and \"Moderate\" range. This level of air quality is comparable to the same period in previous years.Similarly, Singapore’s food security has not been affected by the fires in Australia. Australia is an important source of commonly consumed food items for Singapore, such as meat, milk and sugar. While many parts of Australia experienced the fires, our food supply from Australia remained steady between November 2019 and January 2020.Nevertheless, we are mindful that disruptions in food imports, including those linked to the climate, remain a possibility. Hence, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has been working with food importers to diversify sources across different countries and to adopt plans to mitigate against supply disruptions. Apart from this, we are encouraging Singapore companies to build food production linkages with other countries under our \"Grow Overseas\" strategy. We are also intensifying efforts to boost domestic food production under our \"30 by 30\" vision, to locally produce 30% of Singapore’s nutritional needs by 2030.Mr Speaker: Mr Seah.Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade): I thank the Minister for his answer. Just two short supplementary questions. First, we hope that it does not happen in Australia, the bushfires, but if it continues to occur in future, is it conceivable that this could come to Singapore\t– meaning that the winds change direction\t– and is it conceivable for fires in Australia to reach Singapore, and in such an instance, what preparations do we need to make?My second supplementary question concerns food security. Again, I hear our vision of \"30 by 30\". My question is: given what is happening around the world, how are we on track to achieve it, and is there a need for this \"30 by 30\" vision to be, in fact, accelerated?Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: We have never had a situation where the fires in Australia would actually affect Singapore. We know where the fires, when they burn, affect us almost annually. So, thankfully, I do not think we have to worry yet unless something in the weather patterns change or the intensity of the fire goes beyond this year and last year.On food security: indeed, this is going to be one of the main topics of our Ministry's Committee of Supply (COS). To get Singaporeans to understand that beyond diversifying our food supplies, we really have to be serious about looking at growing the food ourselves. Because when we have a situation 20, 30, 40 years down the line, when everywhere in the world, food growing will be a challenge, we probably have to be prepared to know how to grow food now, to grow in ways that we do not normally or conventionally do. Because in Singapore, we are very constrained by water, by land, even by energy. So, these are the constraints that Singapore has to overcome but I am very confident that with technology and perseverance, we will get to the target of \"30 by 30\" that we set ourselves to achieve."

        "MPs Speaking": "[Mr Arasu Duraisamy (Nominated Member), Mr Charles Chong, Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman, Mr Chong Kee Hiong, The Chairman, Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar), Mr Arasu Duraisamy, Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio), Mr Douglas Foo  (Nominated Member), Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade), Ms Joan Pereira, Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang), The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How), Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade), The Chairman, Ms Sylvia Lim, Dr Ng Eng Hen, Dr Ng Eng Hen, Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Vikram Nair, Dr Ng Eng Hen, Mr Seah Kian Peng, Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang), Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang), Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon), Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry, The Chairman, Mr Vikram Nair, Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied), Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines), The Chairman, Mr Charles Chong (Punggol East), Mr Charles Chong, The Chairman, Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh), Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Charles Chong, Mr Douglas Foo  (Nominated Member), Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Charles Chong, Mr Arasu Duraisamy (Nominated Member), Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar), Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar), Mr Seah Kian Peng, Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade), Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang), The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen), Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon), Dr Ng Eng Hen, Dr Ng Eng Hen, Mr Heng Chee How, The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman), Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)]",
        "Content": "The Chairman: Head J, Ministry of Defence, Mr Vikram Nair.Next Generation SAFMr Vikram Nair (Sembawang): Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head J of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".The last year has seen global tensions rise on multiple fronts. The rivalry between China and the US is playing out on many fronts, including the South China Sea, in the context of a trade war and even over the 5G network and the next generation of technologies. The tensions between Russia and the West are also continuing, with President Putin recently declaring he is ready for another Cuban missile crisis if the US wants one. These great power rivalries have always had repercussions for the rest of the world. While Singapore tries to maintain friendships with as many people as possible, this may not always be easy.Around the region, there is considerable uncertainty. Just up North, in Malaysia, the last two weeks have seen a tussle for the premiership, which has resulted in a change of Prime Minister and change of government. While Prime Minister Muhyiddin was sworn in yesterday, there seems to be further unrest on the streets and the new Prime Minister may well face a challenge, such as a vote of no confidence in the next Parliament sitting. Typically, when there is unrest in our neighbouring countries, governments may feel under pressure to become more nationalistic and this may adversely affect relationships with other countries.At the same time, unconventional threats are growing. Threats to cybersecurity and fake news threaten to subvert our systems from the inside. A classic example was during the early days of COVID-19 when panic was being triggered by messages that misstated the implications of DORSCON Orange and suggested people stockpile to avoid shortages; ironically, it was messages like these that triggered the panic which resulted in the temporary shortages.In the Middle East, tensions between the US and Iran are escalating and the disputes between Saudi Arabia and Iran as well as Saudi Arabia and Qatar continues. ISIS remains a threat and continues to hold territory and both carry out and inspire attacks in other countries.SAF has been the backbone of our national defence. It clearly faces a wide range of threats and contingencies it needs to prepare for. While Singapore does not look for trouble, trouble may well come to us and we have to be ready. However, while our threats are growing and evolving, SAF faces two key constraints – falling manpower arising from a fall in our birth rates and less available spaces for training as land gets put to other uses.The only way forward for SAF is to evolve, to invest in technology so that we can do more with less resources. There have been some exciting announcements of big ticket acquisitions in recent times. The Minister has announced the Air Force is going to acquire F-35 fighter jets to eventually replace its F-16s. In relation to the Navy, plans were announced to replace Republic of Singapore Navy's current submarines with four Invincible-class submarines. In relation to manpower, plans have been announced to develop a hybrid force, so that more and more unmanned technologies will be able to replace men in the fighting force.These are certainly exciting headlines. I will be grateful if the Minister for Defence could provide us more generally, with details on MINDEF's plans to ensure the Next-Generation SAF continues to be effective and capable of safeguarding Singapore's national security. I beg to move.Question proposed.Training AreasMr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon): Chairman, Sir, last year, I had the opportunity to visit SAF's training camp in Brunei. It was heartening to see the dedication of our servicemen who had to man our overseas detachment and to facilitate the training of our visiting SAF soldiers.Over the years, going on overseas training has become a part of what it means to be a member of the SAF, whether it is a regular, NSF or NSMan. We train overseas because we need to overcome our space constraints, to give our people better and more realistic training opportunities in diverse environments.MINDEF and the SAF have worked hard with our partners to provide the SAF access to overseas training facilities. MINDEF recently announced the signing of an Memorandum of Understanding between US and Singapore to establish a RSAF Fighter Training Detachment in Guam (FTD-Guam). Could the Minister for Defence please provide more information on RSAF's Guam Detachment and how it will improve on RSAF's training?Update on Acquisition of F-35My next cut. At last year's Committee of Supply debate, MINDEF announced the intention to purchase the F-35, a fifth generation multirole aircraft, which can provide air-to-air, air-to-ground and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. The F-35's stealth capabilities can help us maintain air dominance and overcome sophisticated air-defence. At the same time, the F-35s can fuse sensors and information from different sources, thereby networking our 4th Generation aircrafts and SAF assets altogether.MINDEF recently announced that Singapore has received the US's approval for the sale of F-35s to Singapore. Could the MINDEF please provide an update on Singapore's acquisition of the F-35s, including how the F-35s will improve the capabilities of the SAF?Maritime SecurityMr Vikram Nair: Chairman, for more than 200 years, sea trade has been vital to Singapore's economy. This remains the case today. Singapore is one of the busiest transshipment hubs in the world and it is important for us to maintain our sea lines of communication.Last year, we had two Malaysian vessels in Singapore waters, which appeared to be a provocative act. However, the Malaysian government did not escalate matters and the Malaysian Navy never got involved in this dispute. This is likely because the Singapore Navy is strong and it was clear it would have been able to defend Singapore if necessary.More recently, in December 2019, there was a report of increasing incidents of sea robbery taking place in the Malacca Straits and the number of such incidents has been higher since 2018. Threats like these may reduce confidence people using our sea lanes. What are MINDEF and the SAF doing to secure our waters?Security LandscapeMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied): Mr Chairman, East Asia is again becoming a site for more intense power contestation, particularly in the South China Sea. Worryingly, some of this competition is taking on more militarised characteristics region-wide. Such developments have the unfortunate consequence of prompting other regional actors to adopt more militarised stances. They include arms acquisitions and more muscular positions over disputes.These developments challenge stability and freedom of access, even if they do not directly involve Singapore.Could the Minister for Defence update the House on the Government's strategy for navigating this increasingly complicated security landscape? Deterrence alone cannot fully address these concerns, and defence spending needs to be within prudent limits. In particular, what role should be played by the SAF on a routine basis and during contingencies and how is the SAF working towards these objectives?Defence DiplomacyMr Desmond Choo (Tampines): Singapore's approach to defence is shaped by both the unique circumstances surrounding our country's independence and the enduring geostrategic limitations we face. Given our strategic circumstances, a strong defence is necessary to ensure that we enjoy peace and stability and that our sovereignty and territorial integrity are protected.In order to defend our sovereignty and promote our national interests, Singapore has worked closely with our international partners to build a stable regional architecture. Despite the challenges involved in navigating an increasingly complex security environment, Singapore has continued to forge strong relations with our key partners such as the US and China. How is MINDEF working with our key defence partners to enhance cooperation and address common security challenges?Singapore is a good friend of both the US and China. The US is our major security and economic partner. Our troops train extensively with US forces. We also cooperate closely on counter-terrorism. The size and scale of US investments in Singapore far out-strip any other country's.With China, Singapore has established an \"All-Round Cooperative Partnership Progressing with the Times\". We have extensive economic cooperation with China. China is also our largest export market.Both these countries are important to us. But we must be clear-eyed about our own national interests and understand the Government's considerations when we adopt principled positions on bilateral, regional or international issues. How do we continue to engage the US and China in our security collaborations?In October 2019, MINDEF chaired the 12th ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM). The ADMM adopted the ASEAN Guidelines for Air Military Encounters (GAME). It is perhaps the first such set of multilateral guidelines in the world. How do we continue to build upon this?The Chairman: Mr Charles Chong. Both your cuts, please.Regional Peace and StabilityMr Charles Chong (Punggol East): Mr Chairman, at last year's Committee of Supply Debate, the Minister spoke about MINDEF's successful chairmanship of the ASEAN Defence Ministers' meeting (ADMM) and the ADMM Plus in 2018. MINDEF has worked hard to ensure that should the need arise, our Armed Forces will be able to defend Singapore against both conventional and unconventional threats.However, the better way to deal with these threats is to do what we can to ensure that they do not arise in the first place. To that end, as ironic as it may appear, the SAF will be truly successful if we never actually need to call on our servicemen and servicewomen to defend Singapore in a time of conflict. Could the Minister provide an update on what MINDEF is doing to ensure that the region remains stable and peaceful?Comprehensive Strategic PartnershipMoving to my next cut. Singapore signed the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) with Australia in June 2015. Australia is a close and valued defence partner and the signing of the CSP was a clear demonstration of the relationship. We enjoy with our Australian friends. While we have had an excellent defence relationship with Australia for many years, the CSP provides a framework for the further deepening of defence engagements between our two countries.1.15 pmWe have already been having our troops trained in Australia for many years. Many of our troops have trained in the Shoalwater Bay training area. Last year's Exercise Wallaby, held from September to November involved some 3,000 SAF personnel in an area almost four times the size of Singapore. This year, I believe, will mark the 30th year that we have been able to use the Shoalwater Bay training area. I know that we are very appreciative of the support provided by the Australian government and the Australian defence force.However, with the recent bush fires in the east coast of Australia, could the Minister let us know if the Shoalwater Bay training area has been affected and whether this has had an impact on the SAF's ability to fully utilise the area as a training ground? In particular, I imagine that the dry conditions and the threat of fires could have had an impact on our use of ordinance and ammunition which would have been a significant reason for using the Shoalwater Bay training area in the first place, and for us committing to spend on developing military facilities there.Coming back to the CSP, this also provides for even greater access to training areas in Australia for our troops. And I would like to ask the Minister if he can provide an update on the enhancements to training facilities, including both in the Shoalwater Bay training area as the new Townsville field training area and how the CSP can improve the SAF's training effectiveness.TerrorismMs Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar): Unconventional security threats, such as terrorism, pose increasingly greater risks to our nation. The on-going turmoil in the Middle East provides opportunities for terrorist groups to step up attacks, not just there, but also close to home. Former fighters, who have acquired skills from their experiences in Iraq and Syria, are returning to Southeast Asia. Singapore is not insulated from the influences of returning foreign fighters.Given the threats from terrorism abroad, would the Ministry share with the House an update on its efforts to counter terrorism? What measures have been implemented to limit their ability to propagate their radical messages and minimise their influence on our communities? In addition, how does the Ministry identify, prevent and monitor potential fighters entering Singapore? For Singaporeans and foreign residents and workers here who may be radicalised, do we have adequate surveillance measures and resources to spot, monitor and contain them?CBRNE materials − chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives – are utilised by terrorists to attack people and infrastructure. How does MINDEF restrict access to such materials in order to minimise potential injuries, deaths and damage?In recent attacks overseas, we have also observed the use of common tools, such as knives, and even vehicles, by terrorists to launch attacks on innocent bystanders. Do we have in place an early alert-and-response system to detect behavioural anomalies which will trigger alerts and calls for urgent assistance?The Chairman: Mr Chong Kee Hiong. Take your both cuts together.Climate Change MitigationMr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Chairman, at last year's National Day Rally, Prime Minister Lee spoke about how climate change is one of the gravest challenges we are facing. I quote, \"Both the SAF and climate change defences are existential for Singapore. These are life and death matters.\"The greatest threat is from rising sea levels, which will erode the shorelines of our small island unless mitigating action is taken. Areas at risk and which require priority protection include our military installations, the airport, central business district, and the industrial estates of Jurong and Tuas. Our defence and economy are at stake.Global warming has also resulted in the weather becoming more extreme. Singapore has become hotter with prolonged dry spells even as we experience bursts of heavier rainfall. Even gusts of wind have become stronger. One concern is about mitigating the impact of these dry periods on our reservoirs. We also need to consider collaborative measures with Malaysia to protect the reservoirs there which supply us with water. We have to plan for ways to protect people and minimise the potential damage to our facilities from flooding and toppling trees, during heavy downpours and storms.In short, a well-coordinated national effort is needed to respond to economic, social and military defence challenges related to climate change. Would the Minister elaborate on what are some of the measures taken by MINDEF and SAF to address these concerns?Polder Pilot DevelopmentChairman, my second cut. Singapore is a low-lying island nation that is vulnerable to rising sea levels as a result of climate change. The Government has committed $5 billion to the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund to fend off the encroaching sea and pledged to top up this fund whenever our budget permits in the future.Mitigating actions being considered include major engineering works, such as empoldering and reclamation of offshore islands and coastal adaptation initiatives, such as planting mangroves. While Singapore has had experience with the traditional land reclamation method, empoldering is new to us. It involves building a dyke around the area to be reclaimed and draining water from within it. The reclaimed low-lying land, known as a polder, will be below sea level, kept dry by the sea wall.Empoldering is being used to add 810 hectares of military training space to the north-western tip of Pulau Tekong. This project was slated to be completed in 2022. May I ask the Ministry for an update on the progress of this construction? What lessons are we gaining from this building experience for the future use of this technique in other reclamation areas? How does this technique compare with the traditional land reclamation method in terms of construction and maintenancecosts, as well as benefits and risks?Defence SpendingMr Vikram Nair: Chairman, the SAF performs an important role in deterring potential aggressors and protecting Singapore. As a small country, we are at a natural disadvantage when it comes to our defence, while at the same time, defence is existential. We have traditionally compensated for our small size by spending more on defence and investing in the best and latest technologies, while at the same time, building good defence relations with a wide range of countries, including all our neighbours as well as some of the middle and great powers, including the US.However, in recent years, defence spending has been rising all around the region and in many other parts of the world. As larger countries also invest and strengthen their forces, our technological edge may diminish and I expect there will be pressure on us to spend more to keep up with them. What is MINDEF's and the SAF's plan? Do they envision a long-term increase in our defence budget to keep up with these rising demands?Financial PrudenceMr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, we are a small city-state with an open economy and we are therefore vulnerable to external factors. As the Minister for Defence Dr Ng has reiterated over the past years, Singapore cannot fail in its frontline defence to protect our sovereignty. Through the past efforts of our predecessors, our SAF is now one of the more modernised armed forces in the region with superior equipment and stronger fighting power.MINDEF previously announced its plans to building a modernised tri-service SAF which include acquiring F-35S Joint Strike Fighter jets to replace the current F-16 fighter jets, acquiring new Invincible-class submarines and multi-role combat vessels as well as new next-generation Armoured Fighting Vehicles for our defence forces. While such expenditure is necessary for modernisation, we have seen budget spending on defence rise steadily from S$14.8 billion in 2018 to S$15.47 billion in 2019. While there is a slight drop in this year's Budget to S$15.1 billion, it is still the highest expenditure among all the Ministries.The importance of maintaining a strong SAF and the need to be accountable to taxpayers requires a balance. In light of the current economic slowdown where we are seeing enterprises struggle to stay in business, the debate on whether we should be spending so much of our taxpayers' money on Singapore's defence or if the money is more well spent aiding our local enterprises will no doubt resurface in the minds of many.Can the Minister share how sustainable it is to spend to modernise and can the Minister explain what is MINDEF doing to ensure that every dollar of the defence budget is spent wisely and prudently?Value for MoneyMs Sylvia Lim: Chairman, MINDEF previously informed Parliament how it attempts to maximise Singapore's defence dollars, through the purchase of only items it needs, retrofitting existing assets and so on. Could the Minister for Defence elaborate also on its acquisition decisions – how MINDEF assesses the reasonableness of the prices quoted by vendors and ensures that it receives fair value for money on its purchases? At stake in these decisions is hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. More importantly, they involve the lives and safety of our men and women in uniform and, ultimately, Singapore's security.A key issue is that unlike other products and services involved in Government procurement, defence articles may not be freely market-tested due to the confidentiality of specifications or dependence on specialist contractors. Systems sold at a certain price point may be subject to expensive after-sales maintenance and upgrade packages with proprietary and protected information. After all, contemporary defence platforms can be highly tailored and involve the integration of multiple systems overseen by large numbers of vendors and sub-contractors.An example is the US F-35 programme. As of January, Singapore's purchase of up to 12 aircraft for an estimated US$2.75 billion is undergoing the US Congressional approval process. However, the programme has been dogged bycost overruns and questions about reliability. There were also issues regarding the leak of confidential data that requiredcostly redesigns and retrofits from various vendors and subcontractors. This is just one well-known example about a single programme.My question is broader. Can MINDEF elaborate on how it injects rigour into its procurement decisions to ensure value for money?Training SafetyMr Charles Chong: Mr Chairman, all of us have either served in the SAF or have a child, parent, relative or close friend who have been in the SAF. The SAF is an intrinsic part of Singapore and is part of our identity as Singaporeans. Part of why the SAF has been successful has been the trust which exists between Singaporeans and the SAF. The SAF enjoys broad support among citizens and we all understand why we need to have mandatory National Service, even if it comes at acost to personal pursuits in academia, sports and other areas.However, when parents send out their sons of to enlist in the SAF or when children bid goodbye to a parent who is going for in-camp training, there is an expectation, a very legitimate expectation, if I may say, that the SAF has done everything possible to ensure that they return home safely. Unfortunately, as is well-known to Members, there have been several training incidents over the last few years, some of which have led to deaths of our servicemen.Just before last year's Committee of Supply debate, the SAF announced the setting up of an Inspector-General's Office (IGO) to scrutinise safety practises at all levels across all services in units of the SAF. Could the Minister provide an update on the work of the IGO, including how many instances of unsafe practises the IGO has identified in the past year and what real steps have been taken to address this? Has training safety in the SAF improved since the IGO was set up, and have additional safety measures been introduced?Finally, could the Minister provide details on the number of calls which have been made to the Army, Navy and Air Force safety hotlines, and whether this has increased since we have enhanced our emphasis on training safety and whether concrete action has been taken following the making of these reports?Safety ConsciousnessMr Arasu Duraisamy (Nominated Member): Chairman, the Committee of Inquiry into the training accidents had found that training-related accidents happened due to lapses by the servicemen involved. These findings demonstrate that training safety cannot just be a matter of safety guidelines and regulations, but must be part of the SAF's organisational culture and practised by every soldier at every level. Can the Minister share, how is the SAF instilling safety consciousness and personal responsibility for one's safety amongst National Servicemen on the ground?1.30 pmMedical SupportMr Charles Chong: Mr Chairman, even as we aim for zero training fatalities, it inherent in the nature of the SAF that accidents will probably happen and the challenge for us then is to ensure that when they do happen, that our service personnel have the very best medical care which we can provide for them.The SAF Medical Corp has been around for over 50 years now and has developed into a professionally run and managed medical service for our servicemen and women. It is, however, important that the medical capabilities of the SAF are continually updated and upgraded to ensure that medical support for our troops is up-to-date, both in terms of practice and procedure as well as in equipment and technology. Now, could the Minister provide some insights as to how the SAF is improving its capabilities to respond to medical emergencies and what steps are being taken by the SAF to ensure that the SAF Medical Corp continues to provide the medical support which our servicemen and servicewomen require?The Chairman: Mr Chong Kee Hiong, take your three cuts together.Diversity of NS CohortMr Chong Kee Hiong: Chairman, the profile of Singapore’s population has evolved over time. Our demography is made up of people from increasingly varied backgrounds.Today, we have a larger proportion of children born to inter-racial and transnational marriages. We also have many Singaporeans who have been born and lived overseas for a number of years, Permanent Residents and new citizens from many different nationalities. This means that our NS resource has become increasingly diverse.I would like to ask the Minister, on an annual basis for our recent cohorts, what is the average proportion of young Singaporeans who have to return from overseas to serve, the proportion of new citizens and the ratio of those who hold foreign passports?National Service is particularly a challenge for young men who have spent extended periods of time overseas. Are there specific orientation programmes to help them adjust to the cultural differences? How is MINDEF and SAF helping National Servicemen from such diverse backgrounds understand the need for National Service and adjust to NS? Most importantly, how does SAF build a sense of unity and solidarity among these cohorts?Enhancing NS ExperienceChairman, my second cut. Our servicemen make much sacrifice towards NS. In order to train and remain fit and ready for their duties, they have to make sacrifices in the areas of their personal and work life. It is important that MINDEF and SAF does its best to help ease the burdens on our servicemen as much as possible.Would the Ministry consider tapping on technology and closer collaboration with employers and even other Government agencies, to enable systematic collation of feedback and harness suggestions on areas of key concern such as childcare and eldercare? The purpose of this suggestion is to enable 360-degree support for our servicemen so that they can better focus on their military duties when in camps, knowing that the other areas of their lives are well supported and taken care of.While much emphasis is placed on the two years as an NSF, it is also important to keep in mind that the entire NS experience also includes the time that the men of Singapore spend as pre-enlistees and Operationally-Ready National Servicemen. Their experience will also influence and have an impact on the next generation of our young who are watching and getting ready to serve the nation.How is MINDEF and SAF working to enhance the NS experience for our National Servicemen at different stages of their NS journey? How can the Ministry tap upon their interests, aptitudes and experiences over the years to serve our nation better?SkillsFutureChairman, my third cut. All young male Singaporeans have to commit two years in the prime of their lives for service to our nation. It is important that we recognise their commitments and contributions, and do our utmost to support them as they prepare for further studies or entry to the workforce as they near their Operationally Ready Date (ORD).MINDEF took some steps in this direction at last year'sCOSwith the introduction of a suite of SkillsFuture@NS initiatives to support our NSF's life-long learning journey. Would the Ministry provide an update of what MINDEF is doing to help our NSFs refresh or acquire new skills as part of their post-ORD transition?I am curious about what support measures MINDEF offer in terms of time allocation and financial support for these NSF to commit to these courses. Is there any way that MINDEF can assist to coordinate areas of synergy so that the courses are both relevant to the NSF's role in SAF and their areas of interest?In addition, will the effectiveness of these programmes be monitored and reviewed? Does the Ministry also take into account feedback and suggestions from the NSFs, education institutions and employers about the usefulness of these initiatives and how improvements can be incorporated over time?TechnologyMs Joan Pereira: Chairman, many Singaporeans go online for all their needs. Our digital connectivity provides opportunities for MINDEF to reach out and engage both the military and civilian forces in joint initiatives. What plans does the Ministry have to further exploit technology to enhance cooperation between both stakeholders for our security? Would the Minister also share how we are leveraging on technology to enhance our soldiers' NS experience and well-being?Technological advances have changed defence strategies and training methods around the world. Would the Ministry share how these technological developments have impacted SAF? Are we adequately prepared to handle increasingly sophisticated and complex equipment? What are the main challenges in securing access to such technologies? How are we progressing in our proprietary defence research and development?NS HubMr Arasu Duraisamy: Sir, in a small country with limited manpower, our National Servicemen play a crucial role in ensuring we have a credible and robust defence force. Every male Singaporean has to commit two years of his youth to serve the country. We must provide a seamless and convenient means for young male Singaporeans to prepare for enlistment. At theCOSdebate last year, MINDEF announced that it would be unveiling the NS Hub in 2023, a single facility that centralises pre-enlistment processes. Could the Minister please provide an update on the status of the NS Hub?Support for National ServiceMr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio): Chairman, in 2017, we celebrated 50 years of National Service in Singapore. Amidst rising threats of terrorism, cyber-attacks and other challenges, we will need to evolve our approach towards NS. To this end, the NS experience must be constantly shaped and re-shaped to address the pressures, demands and desires of our future economy and future generations.Everyone, meaning all Singaporeans, our institutions and community has a role to play in ensuring we have a robust NS system. Thus, our families, employers, schools and community groups are key pillars of support so that our Servicemen can focus on their training.Many of us have seen and participated in the regular Singapore Armed Forces community engagement projects. The Army, the Navy and the Air Force have open house carnivals to engage the public as well as school partnership programmes to engage the students. Besides that, National Education and Total Defence Day are also part of the school’s curriculum.I would like to ask if there are other plans to engage the community such as new citizens and grassroots, to help them understand and appreciate the importance of NS? How about new employers, including those who are newly posted to run operations located here in Singapore? This will ensure that our reservists will similarly be well supported and their role well understood.NS RecognitionMr Douglas Foo: Mr Chairman, National Service is now seen as a rite of passage in every Singaporean man’s life, but the journey does not stop after the NSF’s ORD. Instead, he becomes an Operationally Ready National Serviceman, to begin his 10-year ORNS training cycle. As a Singaporean son, I myself have been through the whole cycle and can testify that it is indeed a unique experience for all. In fact, I am still serving now. My son Donavan has just joined me on this journey of ORNS. I have three more boys who will be joining on this journey soon.However, serving two years of National Service means pushing back one’s plan for education or career. The people living in Singapore, regardless of whether they are citizens or foreigners working here are indirectly benefiting from the sacrifices of our Singaporean Sons, and we hope that all will recognise and appreciate the sacrifices made by them that allow for the enjoyment of peace and sovereignty in our nation.As President of the Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF), I am pleased to share that the SMF is an active partner of MINDEF and fully supports National Service. The SMF has been supporting the SAF Re-dedication Ceremony each year, since its involvement in 2013. Through this annual event, we encourage employers to show their support for National Service and the NSmen working in their organisations as well as to remind them of the important role National Service plays in protecting the nation.Our National Servicemen sacrifice their time and energies to protect Singapore. Besides our young men who set aside two years to serve full-time, our NSmen have to spend two to three weeks away from their families when they return to do their annual In-Camp Training. It is important that we continue to show our appreciation to our Servicemen for their commitment and contribution to defence. How does MINDEF continue to ensure that recognition of our National Servicemen remains both updated and adequate?Precautionary Measures for COVID-19Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade): Mr Chairman, the SAF responded quickly to the COVID-19 situation in Singapore, mobilising our Servicemen to pack masks for distribution to many households. As they contribute to Singapore’s fight against the virus, our Servicemen’s health must be protected as well.Training for SAF often involves close contact, requires high physical exertion, which may lead to transmission of droplets. There may also be many soldiers training within a small space.I know that we cannot compromise our country’s security and safety, by stopping the training exercises and reducing the operational readiness of our forces. At the same time, I am sure that we can modify some of our training procedures and processes to make sure that our men stay strong, safe and healthy. In light of the COVID-19 outbreak, what are some of the precautionary measures that MINDEF has put in place to protect our Servicemen?Digital DefenceMs Joan Pereira: Chairman, over the last few years, we have observed the trend of misinformation and falsehoods being propagated via social media networks and applications escalating. In some countries, the proliferation of \"fake news\" has even influenced the outcome of elections. Here in Singapore, amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, we have seen several pieces of \"fake news\" being circulated, some of which had caused needless panic and fear among certain segments of Singaporeans.How is MINDEF supporting whole-of-Government efforts to prepare Singaporeans to combat the spread of online falsehoods and misinformation? Does the Ministry have an assessment framework to determine when the spread of such online misinformation is threatening our security and at which point will the countermeasures be activated?CybersecurityDr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang): Chairman, over the past year, we have witnessed an increase in the number of cybersecurity breaches. As a response to these incidents, many countries are stepping up efforts to strengthen their cybersecurity capabilities. At a Committee of Supply debate last year, the Minister for Defence announced that a Defence Cybersecurity Centre would be set up. Could I ask the Minister to provide an update on MINDEF's efforts in strengthening our cybersecurity capabilities to deter and act against potential threats?Data ProtectionMr Seah Kian Peng: Data security is core to Singapore’s strong defence and our continued economic success. As malicious threats emerge from various sources, including attempts at data exfiltration, it is essential to strengthen our capabilities and defences against these. Two instances last year have been instructive and both involved data leak of SAF personnel from vendors contracted to the SAF through malicious malware and ransomware.Clearly, we see that there are unfriendly elements watching to see what weaknesses our systems may contain so that they can exploit them. Digital defence is the new addition to our Total Defence. Each and every citizen has a part to play in defending our nation and our way of life – including being vigilant online.Today, there are enemies unseen – scams, fake news, and cyberattacks. Given continual reports of security breaches worldwide, what is MINDEF doing to protect our security systems and ensure that our data and information are not compromised?1.45 pmDigital Defence for BusinessesMr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry: Many of our businesses and companies rely on secure and reliable networks to trade, transact and communicate. They also store vast amount of personal and commercial data in Singapore.As the digital sector expands, it is important that business networks and systems are well protected. We have seen the devastating impact of cyber attacks on individual businesses. More importantly, such attacks also could hurt Singapore's reputation as a trusted hub.Given the pervasiveness of digital threats, MINDEF and MCI introduced Digital Defence as a pillar of Total Defence in 2019. How is MINDEF working with our partners to equip businesses to deal with threats from the digital domain?Psychological DefenceMr Seah Kian Peng: In times of increased stress on society, psychological defence is particularly salient in ensuring Singaporeans remain united in the face of external threats. We have seen how panic and fear can quickly disrupt our way of life.In my main Budget speech, I spoke about the great, the wise and the good, as well as those who mock them. These are taken from the poem by Yeats, \"Come let us mock at the Great\". He urged us to mock at these mockers, people who would not lift a hand to help others out of a great storm.In light of the recent COVID-19 outbreak, it is easy to stand back, stay safe and mock others who are doing the work, taking the risks and deciding on the new rules which would keep our communities going. How important is our state of mind, our psychological defence? What can Singaporeans do to help overcome this crisis?Building Resilience in the CommunityDr Teo Ho Pin: Mr Chairman, Sir, when Total Defence was first introduced in 1984, it was recognised that threats will not simply affect our military but potentially Singaporeans, combatants and non-combatants alike. Thus, we must continue to build resilience in our people and community.In order for Singapore to prevail over a threat, it is important that we fortify the resilience of the entire community. This concept has become more salient today, in the face of threats such as terrorism, cyber attacks, and especially so in face of the recent COVID-19 outbreak.Sir, I wish to ask the Minister for an update on MINDEF's efforts to engage the community and to equip them with the relevant psychological states, knowledge and skills to deal with a myriad of threats that Singapore may encounter.EducationMs Joan Pereira: Over the years, in addition to the core pillar of Military Defence, Singapore has built up the five non-military pillars of Civil, Economic, Social, Digital and Psychological Defences to fortify the comprehensive security structure of Total Defence. All Singaporeans, individually and collectively, have important roles to play in our security, contributing our different expertise and abilities to build a strong and resilient nation.Total Defence had enabled us to overcome past challenges such as SARS, terrorism and economic downturns. It is important that we continue to educate the next generation of Singaporeans to stay united and work together to overcome new threats. How is MINDEF or SAF educating our young about Total Defence?Total DefenceDr Teo Ho Pin: Mr Chairman, the success of Total Defence is contingent upon active participation and contribution by all parts of society, including the Government, businesses, communities and individuals. Unfortunately, the Total Defence initiatives you see today are for the most part initiated by the Government. We should aim to have more civic participation in Total Defence.Civic participation manifested in the form of an app called North West 911, developed by volunteers from the North West Community Development Council (CDC). This app can help Singaporeans to better cope and respond to 14 crisis scenarios and administer basis first aid, among other functions. We are in the process of encouraging more people to download this app so that they can have a crisis guide and a resource directory, all from the convenience of one's pocket.Sir, I wish to call on the Minister to support the North West 911 initiative and urge all Singaporeans, especially members of the uniformed services, to download the app and be operationally ready to respond effectively to any future emergencies. Sir, I wish to ask the Minister for an update on the Government-led and community-led efforts to strengthen Total Defence and their effectiveness.The Chairman: Mr Seah Kian Peng, you can take your two cuts together.New Total Defence LogoMr Seah Kian Peng: Mr Chairman, it has been 36 years since Total Defence was launched. Like many Singaporeans, we are all pleased to learn that MINDEF has recently launched the new Total Defence logo competition to create a new logo that represents all six pillar, including a prize money of $5,000.There were 10 designs that have been shortlisted and I would like to ask the Minister how did Singaporeans respond to the call for the design of the new logo? Could the Minister also explain the significance of the new logo? Make no mistake, I think it is a nice design but I think it is useful and important for all to also know what goes behind the logo.Climate Defence in Total DefenceMy second cut. Singapore adopts a whole-of-society approach to national security. Total Defence was conceptualised in 1984 as a comprehensive model for the defence of Singapore. From 1984 to last year, we have always had five pillars. In 2019, we added Digital Defence as cyber threats were as grave as physical ones.Today, in 2020, I am asking this House to consider one more – Climate Defence. Some may say we are moving too fast in adding one more. I would argue that we have moved too slow. Climate change is an existential threat to Singapore and one we need to recognise. Not only are more of us talking about it now, we are all seeing and feeling the effects of climate change.In my cut at the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), I had argued that we needed a whole-of-Government approach to climate change, given its complex nature, and which straddles many Ministries.With changes in global trends and threats, the securitisation of technology and climate has become an existential threat to our nation. The Young People's Action Party (YPAP) and environmentalists have already proposed that we adopt Climate Defence as the seventh pillar of Total Defence. I support this call.This declaration is not just a matter of policy efficiency. It is a matter of raising the political importance of this issue so that it will no longer be put on the back-burner. Neither will environmental concerns be considered the poor cousin of economic growth in bureaucratic decision-making.In this Budget, we have made room for long-term planning, including for environmental issues. This is the right approach. In line with this approach, would MINDEF consider adopting Climate Defence as a pillar of Total Defence?The Chairman: Minister Ng.The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen): Mr Chairman, first, let me thank Members for their continued support to build a strong defence for Singapore – not only for previous Budgets, which Members have given assent but I hope for this Budget as well – and for many of the Members, for their personal commitment.Many of the Members have done their National Service (NS) and for many here, their children are doing National Service. As Mr Douglas Foo recounted, his sons. As he was speaking, I wished he had more sons and daughters to produce the next generation of NS men.The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, in his round-up speech, reminded us of what Mr Lee Kuan Yew said our obligation was. Our greatest obligation is to the future, and sitting there, listening to Members speak, I think it is virtuous. There were well-informed views about how difficult our external environment is – how fluid, how fast-changing, how it impacts us, how as a small country we have very little wherewithal in which to control our external events and even less to effect changes that come upon us – whether it is climate change, whether it is terrorism, whether it is factious politics in neighbouring countries.But equally, there was strong consensus and pre-occupation about how to build a strong national defence. There were good questions asked and rightly so about prudence, administration, about how we spend our defence dollars, how we make sure that our processes give us the maximum value and that we ensure that where we put our money is, is well chosen and sustainable for our defence budget.There are many issues and what our colleagues and I will aim to do is try to answer to the best of our abilities. First, I think, and foremost, to give a better understanding of how MINDEF and SAF approach these questions which Members have raised. Let me start with how we think about our defence for Singapore.There is a familiar dictum in military annals – that a cardinal mistake which has led to failures has been to prepare for the next battle based on the last war. Analysts cite this specifically for the Vietnam War, where tactics that gave the US victory in Europe during World War II proved ineffective and could not overcome the guerrilla insurgency employed by the Viet Cong. Many of you would have seen the series on Netflix – a gripping documentary that underscores this cardinal mistake.Singapore, as a small nation with little reserves, if caught off guard, should heed this dictum. Mr Vikram Nair put it rightly when he says that, \"We have to be ready.\" But, ready for what?We do not have the resources to plan for all eventualities. Instead, as Members intimated, Singapore must be keenly aware of the changing circumstances around us and how they impact us. Our region, indeed, the world, is at an inflexion point, which many Members pointed out, and it is for this new environment that Singapore must prepare itself.Internally, new military capabilities have been built and are operated by a new generation of SAF soldiers, and operated capably, I must say. And it is because of the steadfast commitment by successive Governments and the overwhelming support from Members of this House, across party lines – Members of Parliament, Non-Constituency Members of Parliament, Nominated Members of Parliament – that we have collectively succeeded in building a strong SAF that is recognised today as a modern and professional military force, capable of defending our national interest. Mr Douglas Foo alluded to that and Mr Charles Chong rightly put it. The very success of the SAF is that we are not tested, and indeed, that is what is said in our mission statement in the financial Budget Book – \"Deterrence\".Even so, to respond to a new environment of security challenges, the SAF must again restructure decisively to meet new challenges, to remain relevant, responsive and effective for our national defence. I think Miss Sylvia Lim talked about it – how the changing landscape will throw forth new threats and the SAF must be ready. I will go into the details of the restructuring required later.But first, the new environment. Members have talked about it. Mr Charles Chong, Mr Desmond Choo, Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Vikram Nair. I agree completely with Members that along with the rest of the world, Singapore has entered a different phase in geopolitics. It is messier, less predictable and therefore, with more unseen events. The post-World War II era of 70 years, championed and spearheaded by a hyper-dominant US together with its Western liberal allies is no longer the only and main narrative. A new chapter has begun with elements of the old but also new principal actors. China is a rising global power but regional powers too are gaining strength, including Japan, India and Australia.And it is not just Asia that is fast-changing. In Europe, the trans-Atlantic alliance is evolving. When the UK government decided to allow Huawei a limited role for its 5G network, the UK dailies concluded that the US-UK relationship had become \"less special\". This year's Munich Security Conference theme was meant to be provocative to prompt soul-searching, but nonetheless carried more than a modicum of insecurities – the theme was \"Westlessness\".2.00 pmAt its plenary, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier sharply criticised the US' \"America First\" policy and that \"Great Again\" was at the expense of neighbours and partners. The US wants the EU to liberalise its trade policies to buy more American goods and spend more to defend themselves. In response, some EU leaders do indeed want to reduce their dependence on the US. Just last year, French President Emmanuel Macron put it starkly, \"American decisions over the last several years... have led us to rethink fundamental diplomatic and military strategy and on occasion elements of solidarity which we thought were forever inalienable\". Europe is far away from Singapore, but the changes there will invariably impact our part of the world.In the Middle East, the biggest game changer is a US that is now a net exporter of energy for the first time in nearly 70 years, and less dependent on crude oil and natural gas from the Middle East than ever before in its history. For the first time too, Russia has direct access to the Mediterranean Sea, and this is a warm water port in Syria, and where it can begin to build and exert military presence there. China, Japan and other Asian countries on the other hand, are still dependent on oil from the Middle East, through the Strait of Hormuz. This is why President Trump remarked wryly, but not inaccurately, that the US was still \"protecting the shipping lanes for other countries for zero compensation\". The US' reaction to the next Middle East crisis will be shaped by these new calculations.The US Department of Defense (DoD) as the action arm of foreign and state policy has made it clear that our region – the Indo Pacific – is now their \"priority theatre\". Why? Pointedly, because of China, which they characterise as a \"strategic competitor\" and \"rival power\". The US DoD is putting that policy in practice, and moving more ships, planes, other equipment and troops to its bases in Japan and Korea, on top of the 78,000 troops already stationed there. For Australia, a record number of US Marines deployed there last year, and the US has plans to build additional military infrastructure in Australia once Congress gives its approval. With President Trump’s support for a bigger defence budget, such efforts will get a boost.What would China do? For China, the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) expansion in blue water capability, air projection, missile and space programmes have gained momentum. Its Navy is now the world’s largest naval force, at least in numbers of ships. Last year, China’s first indigenous aircraft carrier, the Shandong, was commissioned. The US’ recent statements and moves are likely to accelerate, not slow down, the pace of PLA modernisation.European powers too, some in heeding the US’ call and others independently, want to position themselves in Asia. My counterpart, French Minister Florence Parly has said that France, “is not going anywhere, because [it is] part of the region”. True to these words, France sent its warships through the South China Sea and in 2018, its Air Force conducted its largest-ever deployment in Southeast Asia since 2004, from Australia to India, to mark France’s presence in the region. The UK too has actively positioned itself in Asia. In 2018 alone, the British Royal Navy deployed three ships to the region. Last year, the Royal Navy increased its joint military exercises with the US Navy in the South China Sea.Asian countries too have beefed up their militaries. Military spending in Asia has grown more than 50% in the last decade, with both China and India in the list of top five global spenders. ASEAN member states have doubled their spending on defence over the last 15 years.Willy-nilly, these events, conflated, have resulted in the Asia arena becoming more militarised and contested, as Members of this House have noticed. The South China Sea dispute adds grist to the mill but the motivations go much deeper, that of time-old dominance in an evolving world order.For Singapore, a small city state, 700 sq km, five-odd million people, we watch these developments ever so closely, carefully trying to preserve space for ourselves, to maintain our sovereignty and pursue our own interest, something which Member Desmond Choo talked about. We have no desire to take sides or be caught in the crossfire. We stand for our national interest. And so far, we have maintained independence and space for ourselves. But as contestation increases in this region, it will be increasingly difficult to do so.So, I appreciate Members' questions, \"What will you do? What will the Singapore Government do to maintain this wonderful brand of diplomacy?\"Despite the challenges, Singapore was able to forge even stronger defence relations with the US, China and key partners. With the US, as Members observed, we renewed a key document – the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding for the US’ use of facilities in Singapore. And this document had underpinned defence relations between both sides for the last 30 years. The renewal, signed between Prime Minister Lee and President Trump, allows the US forces’ continued access to our air and naval bases for another 15 years.With China, we enhanced the 2008 Agreement on Defence Exchanges and Security Cooperation. This year will be the first time the SAF is planning to conduct two bilateral exercises with the PLA in the same year. At our recent Airshow, for the first time, the Ba Yi aerobatics team performed as did the US’ F-22 and F-35B.With India, our militaries held bilateral exercises across all three Services under the ambit of our Bilateral Agreements and we continue to welcome India’s engagement of the region. With Australia, as Mr Charles Chong said, our 30th year of our training in Shoalwater Bay this year, our strategic partner, we are building our joint training facilities and it is on schedule. I will give some details later. And we were very glad that we could contribute two Chinooks and RSAF personnel to assist the Australian Defence Force during the recent bushfires.Against the changing geopolitics, we have to watch it, we have to respond nimbly to it if we can, and we have to prepare for it. Even so, we would need to respond to clear and present security threats – namely three, and Members have talked about them: terrorism, cyber threats and maritime threats.Against terrorism, which Ms Joan Pereira highlighted, we are not immune to the returned fighters. In fact, not only not immune, but quite vulnerable. Because there are choice targets in this region. Against them, we have stepped up efforts and formalised intelligence sharing through the ASEAN \"Our Eyes\" initiative. The SAF will assist in this effort and work closely with other like-minded countries.The SAF is restructuring its own military intelligence outfits, so that counter-terrorism intelligence to detect, forewarn – what Ms Pereira warned about. We need an outfit that tells us, at least alerts us, that there are plots being undertaken. And also responding to these plots are now part and parcel of the core mission to protect Singapore. It will be a key deliverable and accountability for SAF intelligence units even as they work together with other Singapore agencies dealing with this space.Some Members asked about cyber – Ms Joan Pereira, Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mr Seah Kian Peng. To guide the restructuring efforts required to meet security challenges, the SAF and MINDEF have convened two high level committees. One of the committees is against cyber threats, headed by Permanent Secretary (Defence Development) and CDF to spearhead this effort. In the SAF’s history, this is as important as raising another service, just like Army, Navy and Air Force, namely to build an integrated cyber command and force to defend our digital borders, especially against foreign cyber actors, both state and non-state who seek to undermine our stability and/or pose a threat to national security. Dr Teo Ho Pin asked for updates from last year when we talked about building up a cyber force.We have thought about it, gone deeper. And basically, the challenge is to build, just like Army, Navy and Air Force, an integrated cyber command and cyber force that can operate, defend and protect our interests in the cyber domain.None here, I suspect, will question the need for such a cyber force. But in many aspects, the cyber domain is more difficult to plan and execute than in air, land and sea, and may require different types of units and force configuration. The simplest question: who is the enemy? For air, land and sea, you have a limited number who are potential aggressors. But in cyber, it could be potentially many more.So, the committee intends to be bold in examining ways that we can address this challenge but also as important, is to recruit soldiers of the right aptitude, their training and deployments. Because what you recruit for air, land and sea, may be different from what you need in the cyber arena.Nevertheless, for command integrity and accountability, after the restructuring, CDF will continue to be in charge of mission outcomes – never mind the challenges; there has to be a command structure, there has to be a Commander who is in charge, who is looking at the problem, making decisions, raising training, sustaining forces to be able to meet these challenges. And the Chief C4I will be the pinnacle position that holds accountability and reports directly to the CDF, similar to the other services.The SAF cyber command will have to provide threat assessments and early warning in cyber attacks, and also respond accordingly. The universe of cyber threats and activists is large and the cyber command will have to prioritise its efforts and focus on key threats so as to not dissipate resources. This restructuring effort will take some years to accomplish.Let me turn to maritime security, which a number of Members has brought up, including Mr Vikram Nair. The SAF and indeed the whole-of-Government had made changes to better tackle maritime threats, which have expanded in recent years. The recent spike in sea robbery incidents in the Singapore Strait is but one example, as well as intrusions into Singapore Territorial Waters.RSN’s Maritime Security Task Force (MSTF) will be acquiring new purpose built platforms that can enhance our capabilities to deal with such threats. For a start, four refurbished patrol vessels will be dedicated and deployed for greater persistence to protect our territorial waters. But all of us know that maritime threats are transnational in nature and cannot be solved without co-operation and collaboration of our neighbours. We have reached out to our counterparts in Malaysia and Indonesia to propose that the Malacca Straits Patrol initiative, which has worked so well through coordinated patrols to reduce piracy in the Malacca Strait, be extended to other areas in our surrounding waters. Discussions are on-going.These significant restructuring efforts against terrorism, cyber and maritime threats reflect the rapidly evolving spectrum of threats that today’s Singapore faces. But whatever the threats, for each SAF unit, effective training makes the decisive difference. In an uncertain landscape, we must raise, train and sustain units within the SAF to deal with both conventional and unconventional threats. I think this was a point that Mr Henry Kwek was alluding to.With your permission, Mr Chairman, may I display some slides on the screens.The Chairman: Yes, please. [Slides were shown to hon Members.]Dr Ng Eng Hen: So, let me deal with conventional operations. For conventional operations, the SAF aims to have the best training facilities globally. So, we talked about conventional; we talked about unconventional. For conventional training, our simple goal is that we want to have the best training facilities in the world. It is a high mark but we are confident we will achieve this.Some Members have asked about developments in Shoalwater Bay, Mr Charles Chong, in particular. And let me give some updates under our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Australia, which will be a key node for best of class training facilities. It will provide the SAF with modern instrumented training ranges such as the Combined Arms Air-Land Ranges and the Urban Operations Live Firing facilitiesin an area approximately 10 times the size of Singapore.2.15 pmSignificant progress has been made, with completion of an ammunition storage building last year. The Combined Arms Air-Land Ranges is now being developed for the Army and Air Force to train together with tanks, infantry vehicles, drones, artillery and other combined arms platforms. This will be complemented by the Urban Operations Live Firing facilities for air and combined arms live-firing in a realistic environment. And these facilities will be equipped with advanced targetry and instrumentation. In essence, when completed, we can conduct complex training on a much larger scale, that only few militaries are able to, elsewhere. We expect construction at Shoalwater Bay to be completed by 2024 and Greenvale – that is another site – to be completed by 2028. When these facilities are completed, the SAF will be able to conduct integrated training across all three Services, involving up to 14,000 personnel annually and over a span of up to 18 weeks. This is a significant asset for our defence capabilities.Mr Charles Chong asked what will be the effect of climate change on these plans. The short answer is probably nobody knows and we have to watch it very carefully. There were the incidents of the bush fires this year. And it not only will affect us but also more impactfully, the Australian Defence Force (ADF). For the Shoalwater training area, there was some halt in some activities not because there were bush fires there but because of the fear that it may accentuate it. So, we are watching it very carefully, and if we have to make adjustments, we will have to.For the Navy, our ships have ample opportunities to train overseas. During Exercise Pacific Griffin, the US and our ships successfully fired the full suite of missiles, destroyed surface and air targets and hunted submarines. We also conducted the inaugural trilateral maritime exercise in the Andaman Sea with India and Thailand. This year, the RSN will take on a key leadership role in the world's largest multilateral maritime exercise, Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC), alongside established navies in the Pacific Ocean. The RSN does well in these overseas deployments that validate its systems and benchmark competencies.The Navy is also making good progress to strengthen our conventional capabilities. The last three of the fleet of eight Littoral Mission Vessels entered into service last month. In Germany, our new Invincible-class submarine has commenced trials in the water and her pioneer crew is undergoing work-up training.What about the Air Force, as Mr Henry Kwek asked. For the Air Force, the skies have opened up. In December last year, I signed an MOU with US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper to establish a fighter training detachment in Guam. The RSAF plans to deploy our F-15s, F-16s and supporting assets, such as the Gulfstream 550 – Airborne Early Warning to Guam for training. The airspace around Guam, together with training facilities, will allow the RSAF to conduct larger scale, more complex and realistic air-to-air and air-to-ground training. At the same time, this detachment in Guam, alongside other deployments in Australia, India and Thailand will allow quick re-deployment back to Singapore when required. So, it is a significant asset. You can train nearer; we can bring you back if we need you.Some have asked for an update on our acquisitions of the F-35s. We have decided on the F-35B variant of the aircraft, which can take off from a shorter runway and land vertically, and it is an important feature in land scarce Singapore. I do not know whether it can land in one of your HDB carparks but we will consider this scenario. The F-35B performed in the recent Singapore Airshow and its ability to swivel 360 degrees was simply, as some people said, \"Awesome\". We did not buy the F-35B or we did not order F-35Bs just because it can do that. As Mr Kwek rightly pointed out, it has a full suite of sensors and fighting capabilities. We have obtained the US government and Congress' assent. MINDEF is in the final stages of acquiring our four F-35s, with an option to purchase eight more. And when delivered, which we hope will be around 2026, the F-35Bs will be deployed in US for training and in-depth evaluation.Ms Svlvia Lim raised good questions about the question marks over the F-35 and we watch it very closely. We said we will buy four, evaluate it fully before deciding to commit on a further eight. And our timelines are, if you like, useful to us. We are in no hurry – the F-15s and F-16s are adequate for our air defence and air capabilities. And we will evaluate them fully, including all the questions that were attributed to the F-35s, includingcost and maintenance before we decide fully on a full fleet of the F-35s.I have talked about conventional and traditional operations. Let me move on to non-traditional operations, for which we must prepare not only the SAF, but indeed, I think, our entire population, for a more uncertain and expanded array of threats – we call these \"grey zone\" threats, as opposed to black and white.Low-level terrorist attacks are a good example of \"grey zone\" threats that can turn deep black when the whole country is destabilised. What happened to Ukraine in the early stages is a salutary lesson on \"grey zone\" threats – incipient, then it cascades, extrapolates and blows up. And when you try to mount the defence, you are finished.So, the SAF has compiled the range of such \"grey zone\" threats – of course, you will pardon me if I do not give you a list of \"grey zone\" threats – and the options available to respond for each. Each, by themselves, if limited, do not threaten our sovereignty but nevertheless can lead to instability or, cumulatively, whittle away our ability to defend national interests.Another example of a non-traditional threat occurred, as some Members pointed here, when COVID-19 hit Singapore, that tested our Total Defence. At a very short notice, the Army packed 5.2 million masks, delivered them to 89 Community Centres and Clubs to distribute to 1.37 million households within two days. The SAF also helped MOH with contacting personnel as well as manning thermal imagery machines at the airport. And these efforts by the SAF were to enhance our psychological, social and economic resilience. My colleague, Senior Minister of State Maliki will speak more on Total Defence.There is another threat for which the SAF may not be primarily responsible, but must join in the efforts for Singapore's security and safety. Mr Chong Kee Hiong alluded to it. Mr Seah Sian Peng talked about it. And yes, I agree with Mr Seah that we must adopt climate defence.The Government has laid out key directions – Senior Minister Teo's Inter-ministerial Committee of Climate Change has done very deep second, even third order work in terms of how we can step wise deal with this issue. And I appreciate the efforts because it focuses our attention. It also gives, to the extent available, quantitative or if not, semi-quantitative projections of what each does. And I think that is the right approach.The SAF is also making significant change as part of the whole-of-Government (WOG) plan.Against the effects of rising sea levels, MINDEF and SAF is working with relevant agencies closely on coastal adaptation. Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked about the progress in Singapore's first polder development at Pulau Tekong that is led by HDB. As he described it, the polder comprises a dike which protects the reclaimed land from the sea and a network of drains and pumps to keep the land dry. The tracts of land created, which are below sea level, will be used for Army training.It is early days yet so I do not have anything concrete to report. But obviously, this is an important project which we are learning from as we create new land for countering rising sea levels. And if this succeeds, that model and that template can be used for other areas in Singapore. So, it is an important project. And MINDEF and SAF understand this.MINDEF and the SAF are on track to meet our national targets to reduce energy and water consumption. Some Members have raised the NS Hub. It will be completed in 2023. Mr Duriasamy talked about it. It was designed to maximise natural ventilation and daylight. I would have thought all SAF buildings were designed for natural ventilation and daylight nowadays. But take this as what is meant, it is to maximise natural ventilation and to reduce solar heat gain. So, that is a plus now – solar heat gain and energy demand. We have set an aim for the NS Hub to be the top 10% of energy-efficient buildings in Singapore. I expect that aim to be achieved.The SAF is also taking discrete steps to reduce carbon emissions, even changing modes of operation without loss of any effectiveness. First, we intend to replace our 400 administrative vehicles to reduce CO2emissions. To hybrid models first, reducing emissions by up to two-thirds per vehicle and later when our island's infrastructure is built, with electric vehicles.We also established a waste management system under a joint collaboration with NEA and DSTA that turns recycled food waste into energy. Here, a caveat, we have cut down waste. I noted that I have replied to a particular question on it. It is not much waste but that is a first important thing to do. But where there is waste, we turn it into recycled energy. Currently, food waste collected from eight cookhouses is processed by microbes and enzymes at recycling plants to generate biogas. And we are looking to expand this to 10 more cookhouses. If successful, this will be expanded to all cookhouses.MINDEF has commissioned net zero energy buildings at Kranji and Seletar Camps, and by the end of this financial year, the buildings in 12 of our camps will be equipped with solar panels. In March, we will deliver, which we already are, we will deliver the first net positive energy aircraft hangar at Changi Air Base, which can generate more electricity than that consumed due to certain features that were incorporated into the design of the hangar. When fully realised, these efforts combined will reduce 11,400 tonnes of CO2emissions by the end of this financial year and support our national efforts to combat climate change.These measures extend to our training areas overseas as well. We have mentioned Shoalwater Bay training facilities. We are working with the Australian Department of Defence to incorporate environmentally sustainable design measures, such as solar-powered lighting and using building materials that have a higher proportion of recycled content. We are taking proactive efforts to mitigate flood and fire risks, through the use of flood modelling, and the construction of fire breaks and the use of non-combustible fire-rated materials. And this is in answer to Mr Charles Chong's question.Adapting to use \"green\" technologies could also reap operational advantages. The Navy is exploring the use of hybrid propulsion systems in designing its incoming vessels. Such technologies enable our new ships to not only reduce carbon emissions, but become more energy efficient.In the grand global scheme of changes necessary to mitigate climate change, one could say that our total reduction of CO2emissions that I just talked about might be considered insignificant, and I would agree. But all agencies and countries must start on this road to recovery.Let me focus on the NSmen who make up the bulk of our SAF. Senior Minister of State Heng will touch on some initiatives to recognise their contributions, but I mentioned earlier a second high level committee.This committee has been formed to look at two areas – the In-Camp Training (ICT) and the deployment of manpower, chaired by Deputy Secretary (Administration) and the Chief of Army. This committee must address the reduction in manpower and changes necessary to fulfil the aims of the SAF, as well as to meet the needs of a new generation of NS men, which many of you eloquently spoke for. The number of ICTs for each NSman will remain the same. Let me say that again – the number of ICTs for each NSman will remain the same. But we want to improve the outcome and efficiency of each ICT.2.30 pmFor manpower, while we have already restructured the SAF to match the reduction in overall manpower, we do need to better match skills and aptitude of National Servicemen to their vocations, as well as to make training more focused on their operational roles. We will announce these specific changes in due course.Last year, I informed the House about the Inspector-General’s Office (IGO) which was stood up to strengthen safety and Senior Minister of State Heng Chee How will share and reply to some of the questions that Members have raised.Mr Chairman, as I have indicated previously, we can continue to maintain and grow the SAF with a defence spending that avoids sharp ups and downs but which at least keeps pace with inflation, about 3% to 4% nominal increase each year. A number of Members have asked – Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Douglas Foo and Ms Sylvia Lim – whether we are able to meet our challenges with the defence spending and I would say our assessment for now is yes. The commitment holds, with a projected increase for this year's Budget over last year's of 3.2%.A number of questions have been asked, how do we make sure that not only are we prudent, but that our processes give us the maximum returns for each defence dollar – Mr Douglas Foo, Ms Sylvia Lim.When we procure platforms or services, a thorough study is made on life-cyclecosts. Ms Lim is quite right, I can sell you something with the low price but really dock off your dollars with high maintenancecost. We are a little better at the game. We put everything as life-cyclecosts, so that I know the exactcost of a platform over its life-time; a thorough study is made.Even though we have sensitive needs for the majority of projects, it is really by open tenders to ensure competitive building. So, if you take all our contracts that the SAF and MINDEF put out, majority are still by competitive bidding and open tenders. That is how we ensure we can get fair value. But even for classified needs, we ensure that a few companies pass security requirements. We pre-qualify them, in other words, we ensure that we have more than one company that satisfies our security requirements so that they can bid competitively. That is the second prong.But in specific circumstances, which Ms Lim asked about, where requirements can only be fulfilled by a single vendor, DSTA does its own stringentcosting and we will compare the bid price versus our internalcosting, if it is too far from our evaluation, whether too high or too low, we re-evaluate it. Too high because this is not fair value. But too low, we are worried that you cannot deliver the product that I want.These processes have strengthened our procurement and indeed if you ask the industry and the industry is well-informed, DSTA is widely acknowledged as a \"tough customer\" and \"reference buyer\"; people have said that to me. Because when DSTA signs off on this, it tells to the whole universe of procurers that this product is value-for-money. That is why sometimes they go the extra mile – the suppliers and the vendors make the extra efforts to try to sell things to us – because DSTA does a thorough evaluation not only in terms of ability, but value for money.The other significant aspect to stretch the defence dollar is through design from inception. So, for example, the Army's Hunter Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) that were commissioned last year were chosen not only for their new capabilities but because they were maintenance-friendly by design. We saved up to 40% in maintenancecosts as compared to other armoured vehicles. And there are many such examples wherecost has been saved through maintenance or reduction in crew.Mr Chairman, let me conclude. Let me thank the Members of this House for their strong and continued support both as Members of Parliament and in their individual capacity outside this House. It is the collective resolve and commitment of all Singaporeans, including Members of Parliament here, to build a strong SAF that protects our home and provides us assurance and space in this unpredictable world. [Applause.]The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How): Mr Chairman, Minister for Defence just spoke about how our geopolitical environment is becoming increasingly complex. The SAF must evolve with these challenges in order to be able to mount a strong national defence. Our greatest asset remains our people, with National Service or NS, as the cornerstone of our defence. MINDEF and the SAF must therefore continue to invest in capable national servicemen, enrich their NS experience and strengthen Singaporean's support for NS.The SAF is are committed to training our national servicemen effectively and safely. Families entrust their sons to us. We must and we will uphold the trust in us.Mr Charles Chong asked about improvements to training safety. Last February, the SAF Inspector-General's Office, or IGO, was formed to scrutinise and enforce the safety measures in SAF units. IGO inspectors go to each unit to assess the robustness of their safety systems as well as their practices. They interview servicemen at every level – from commanders, to safety appointment holders, to soldiers – in order to understand how safety measures are practised on the ground and whether the soldiers themselves feel confident and comfortable to provide feedback on safety. The IGO has already audited 70% of all formations and their sub-units across the SAF and they will complete this first round of audits by September this year.Safety audits aside, there must also be concrete, consistent action at all levels and at all times. The Army has introduced 100% inspections of all high-risk activities and field training. Existing equipment are regularly reviewed, while new equipment are designed with inbuilt safety features. For instance, the newly commissioned Hunter Armoured Fighting Vehicle comes with emergency stop features, as well as audio and visual alerts to prompt the crew about surrounding hazards.As Mr Arasu Duraisamy pointed out, we want every soldier to consciously keep safe while they train. It is not a compromise, it is both at the same time. To achieve this, unit commanders conduct before- and after-action reviews and risk assessments with the units as part of their daily work. The 6th Army Maintenance Base is an example. During morning roll calls, their commanders and soldiers discuss openly about possible lapses or near-misses; for example, if you use the wrong tools or soldiers not wearing their helmets and so on. Using a simple Think-Check-Do approach, the soldiers systematically plan their steps, check their equipment and pre-empt risks before each maintenance task. Over time, every soldier will internalise these safety practices.We are also harnessing technology. Last year, I spoke about SafeGuardian, which is a one-stop mobile app for on-the-go access to safety checklists, instant sharing of hazards among servicemen and notification amongst them of danger zones. By placing safety information within the easy and instant reach of our servicemen, we foster a culture of safety – \"By All, For All\". The app was trialed in our Naval Bases and feedback has been positive. We will be progressively rolling this out throughout the SAF.I have spoken so far about preventive measures to keep our soldiers safe as they train. Mr Charles Chong asked how the SAF is improving its response to medical emergencies when accidents happen. SAF Medics undergo an 11-week training on life-saving skills. To enhance their competencies, the SAF has partnered the SCDF, under an initiative known as Project Serve, to create a six-month attachment within the SCDF's national emergency ambulances. In other words, the SAF medics go with the SCDF paramedics in the ambulances attending to real cases. By doing so, they put their knowledge into practice under real-life, time-pressured situations.Recently, we also piloted the attachment of our medics to the NUH Emergency Medicine Department. Such hands-on trainings are extremely valuable to our medics – they have emerged from such trainings, more confident and competent in casualty management. Discussions are currently underway with both the SCDF and the other hospitals to extend and expand such programmes.Through these various initiatives, we will build a capable fighting force that will always train effectively and safely.Moving from safety to health, Mr Seah Kian Peng asked about the precautionary measures that the SAF has put in place to protect our servicemen in light of the COVID-19 threat. MINDEF and SAF take reference from the Government's advisories, guidelines and requirements. We gave pre-enlistees who have travelled to China and are due for enlistment a mandatory Leave of Absence (LOA) and deferred In-Camp Training for NSmen who have travelled to China.Last week, we extended these measures to pre-enlistees and NSmen who have travelled to Daegu City or to Cheongdo County in South Korea, in line with MOH's revised advisory. In other words, we keep a very very close eye on the situation and we adjust accordingly.All SAF Medical Centres have a Pandemic Readiness Response Plan and we hold sufficient supplies of Personal Protective Equipment and we also have medical personnel ready to manage suspected cases in line with MOH's requirements. With the change to DORSCON Orange, the SAF has also stepped up preventive measures within camps, requiring our personnel to take their temperature twice daily, conducting more frequent disinfection of workplaces as well as staggering meal times. We will continue to do our utmost to protect our servicemen.Let me now talk about enhancing the NS experience. While our robust training and safety measures and medical support give our soldiers the confidence to train well and to train hard, the enduring strength of the SAF ultimately rests on the commitment on the part of our soldiers. This is why we constantly look for ways to improve the NS experience for every serviceman, at every stage of his NS journey. This point was raised by Mr Chong Kee Hiong.For pre-enlistees, we are preparing them better for NS, both physically and mentally. As Mr Chong Kee Hiong pointed out, our pre-enlistees come from diverse backgrounds. For the vast majority, obviously are still citizens born and bred in Singapore and who, as Members have pointed out, most likely have family members who had undergone NS. Yet there are also new citizens and PRs who may not have family or friends who have undergone NS before. In other words, they may know less compared to Singaporeans who were born and bred here.To better equip this group, we partnered ACCORD to appoint dedicated NS Coordinators in Foreign System Schools and Privately Funded Institutions in order to assist with their questions and clarifications about NS. We are also facilitating mutual learning and exchange among NS coordinators. In one such exchange, which was hosted by United World College (South East Asia) last year; I was there and the discussions were very enriching, frank and open. Everybody found it very useful. There will be another round upcoming and I look forward to attending it as well.We are also aware that many pre-enlistees want to be more physically prepared before they enter NS. Hence, MINDEF is collaborating with SAFRA to make gym facilities more accessible through the Pre-Enlistees Exercise Programme for National Service, or PREP4NS. Under PREP4NS, pre-enlistees can sign up for a one-year complimentary membership to six SAFRA gyms conveniently located in different parts of Singapore. This trial is on-going, we have so far about 6,000 pre-enlistees signed up for the membership since its launch last November. We are also looking at increasing more venues and for this, we are now working with SportSG in order to see how best to give membership access its 24 gyms. More details on this will be provided later when we are clearer.Let me move on now to our full-time National Servicemen, or NSFs. NSFs devote two full years to serving the nation. It is therefore incumbent upon us as stewards of their time and talents to make sure that we support their aspirations.2.45 pmSo, take, for instance, the Vocational Interest initiative. This was started in 2016 and under this initiative, NSFs may indicate their interest in 33 NS vocations. What MINDEF, SAF does is, we do our best to match them as far as possible to the vocation of their choice, subject to, obviously, our operational requirements. This has been well-received amongst the NSFs. We are encouraged to see that more than 60% indicate interest in demanding vocations such as in Infantry, Guards, Armour and strong interest by our NSFs to also become commanders.To help our NSFs acquire new skills as they transit to studies or work after their Operationally Ready Date (ORD), MINDEF introduced the \"SkillsFuture@NS\" initiative last year where NSFs can use their E-PREP credits, which is $350 worth of E-PREP credits, and they may access training and choose from a pool of about 3,000 courses. These courses range from SkillsFuture Series courses, to those offered by Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) that will aid the NSFs in their admission or to gain them credit exemptions. Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked for an update on this.So, for this year, we will be introducing further enhancements. First, NSFs can look forward to full subsidy of the E-PREP courses as opposed to currently allowing the E-PREP credits to fund up to 90%. You can fund it all.Second, we will raise the number of E-PREP courses that are available, expand the pool of E-PREP courses. I am excited to share that two new institutions are coming on-board to offer E-PREP courses, namely, NUS and ITE, bringing the number of E-PREP partners to nine. For our existing E-PREP partners, we have also worked closely with them to expand their course offerings. With these additions, NSFs across the SAF and the Home Team will be able to enjoy a pool of some 4,000 courses, up 1,000 from last year, from 1 April this year. Out of these, close to 100 will be credit-bearing as they undertake further studies. This compares with 26, the year before.In order to recognise the contributions of our NS personnel, we have also increased the monthly NS allowance quantums from their current levels, which varies according to your rank, vocation, deployment. They will go up by between an additional $70 to an additional $120. So, depending on what is your current rank, level, vocation and your deployment; it will go up by between $70 and $120. This will be applicable to NSFs and NSmen in both the SAF and the Home Team, covering all ranks and vocations from 1 March 2020. Mr Douglas Foo brought this up, I thank him for that.As we continue to place our national servicemen at the heart of what we do, we also constantly ask ourselves – how can we serve ever more efficiently and effectively? This is why we are applying digital technologies to various facets of NS, from administration and training to healthcare. Ms Joan Pereira asked about this, so allow me to share some information.For our servicemen, their NS journey begins at the Central Manpower Base, or CMPB. Over the years, we have enhanced the experience at CMPB for pre-enlistees. Infrared scanners were introduced in 2015 to measure body dimensions quickly and accurately. A real-time queue management system and facial recognition technology are also on trial for a more seamless experience.Come June this year, we will complement these on-site enhancements with improved e-services to provide our pre-enlistees an even more hassle-free experience of completing most transactions online. For instance, pre-enlistees will be able to complete their bond and exit permit application in one single online application and transaction instead of the separate applications and transactions that they currently have to do. Pre-enlistees will also be able to monitor the progress of their applications online.As for the new NS Hub to be completed in 2023, which Mr Arasu asked about, that will integrate smart technologies, such as biometric identification and other initiatives on trial at CMPB today. These, we expect, will cut waiting time by about a third.Another initiative is \"Virtual Care\". Under Virtual Care, medical officers in the SAF use technologies such as digital stethoscopes and video conferencing tools to diagnose effectively and prescribe medicine for common ailments remotely. Last year, this service was piloted at two SAF medical centres. It has proven to be convenient, it actually also allows the diagnosis to be done faster because you do not have to wait for the doctor and the patient to physically meet as applied to common ailments. So, this has made medical services more accessible, more convenient and has reduced wait times.I have just spoken about MINDEF and the SAF's efforts to provide the best possible experience for every national serviceman. As Mr Ang Hin Kee highlighted, our families, businesses, schools and community groups are also key pillars of support. Through ACCORD, we will continue to appreciate and rally strong societal support for NS. My deepest appreciation to ACCORD members especially, for contributing their ideas and for so proactively putting their initiatives into action within their respective communities.The business community, for example, has stepped up to show appreciation for our soldiers. Earlier, Mr Douglas Foo has also elaborated on what the SMF as a business federation has done.Under the \"We Support NS\" campaign, over 540 merchants, businesses and hawkers last year offered a wide selection of discounts to past and present national servicemen. Amongst them is Mr Anthony Low, hawker-owner and Chairman of Boon Lay Hawker’s Association. So, what Mr Low did was he rallied more than 60 hawker stalls within his Association's membership to provide privileges to national servicemen, after seeing how his son had toughened up through NS.In so many different ways and individual ways, we can make a difference. So, every effort and every gesture counts and it is appreciated. To thank the businesses for their support, we held the inaugural \"We Support NS\" Appreciation Function last year and we thanked more than 200 merchants who came to meet us. We hope that the momentum can be kept up.Likewise, ACCORD has engaged the communities – different communities – in multiple ways to continue fostering wide and deep support for NS. So, this journey never ends, and in the context of what was discussed, the need for Total Defence in all its dimensions is something that we have to keep doing and press on.Mr Chairman, through continued whole-of-society commitment to our defence, we will demonstrate our will and resolve to protect Singapore's freedom and sovereignty, come what may.The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman): Mr Chairman, the strength of a nation depends largely on the readiness of her people to resist and respond to the threats, and there are various manifestations. These demands and all-round defence and a deterrent strategy best provided by Total Defence, with its six pillars and emphasis on everyone playing their part.Total Defence has rallied Singaporeans together in responding to challenges that have threatened our independence and well-being. Despite these challenges, be it threats from terrorism, economic downturns and SARS, we overcame them all. The outbreak of COVID-19 is the latest test of our collective strength as a nation. Mr Seah Kian Peng asked how Singaporeans can play a part to overcome this crisis.In the past month, we have seen how fear of the virus had led to panic buying of household essentials, hoarding and profiteering from the sale of masks and shunning of our healthcare workers. Yet at the same time, we came across countless heartwarming examples of how Singaporeans have displayed quiet strength and resolve to fight this crisis together – residents leaving hand sanitisers and spare masks in common areas for others, and University students bringing food for their classmates who were on leave of absence.Religious leaders have also come together to provide religious guidance during this period. The Islamic Religious Council for Singapore, for example, has said in an advisory to Muslims that Islam excuses those who are unwell from attending congregational prayers, including Friday prayers. Muslims are also advised to set aside the practice of salam or shaking hands to ensure that they do not transmit the virus. Some temples and churches are scaling back or cancelling regular services and urging followers to watch their services online instead. I really appreciate the guidance provided by the religious leaders to rally the community together in the current situation.The Government is mindful that Singaporeans and businesses are facing pressures as Singapore is affected by economic downturn, slow-down and uncertainties from this COVID-19 outbreak. In Budget 2020, the Government has announced measures to help businesses directly affected by the outbreak. We must build resilience in our economy.It is heartening to know that the businesses are exemplifying economic defence by implementing business continuity plans, sending workers for retraining and following calls to disinfect working areas regularly. Companies like Singapore Airlines, Singtel and SMRT, are finding ways to avoid retrenching their workers by cutting capital spending, operatingcosts and wages for managerial staff. Hopefully, these measures will provide workers with greater job assurance and help them cope and emerge stronger from the difficult period. Some like CapitaLand and Changi Airport have also offered rental relief to help retailers cope with the COVID-19 crisis.As businesses do their part, fellow Singaporeans should also show solidarity – take the necessary precautions and carry on with our own life; eat and shop as you normally do and support these businesses. Please do not panic when you see shops disinfecting their premises or medical workers in Personal Protection Equipment or PPE providing assistance – these practices are routine precautionary procedures at a time like this.As we fight the virus, concurrently, we are also fighting an even greater threat – the spread of fake news. According to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Study, fake news can travel six times faster than true stories.In the past month, false information on the closure of schools and the closure of an MRT station due to the spread of COVID-19 was propagated.When you receive messages or unsubstantiated information over WhatsApp or other online platforms, do not forward or circulate them. Always check the information against official sources like the Government websites or the official news releases. If you are unsure, do not spread the information. Such discipline will go a long way in our fight against fake news.All in all, Singaporean can and will overcome this COVID-19 situation if Singaporeans are psychologically resilient and support the Government and businesses to deal with this outbreak. We should not be easily rattled and instead show confidence as a people. As my soldiers often say in Hokkien \"ai zai\" or be steady. Mr Chairman, may I say a few words in Malay, please?(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Religious leaders in Singapore have come together to provide religious guidance and to prepare measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. For instance, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) had advised Muslims in Singapore that, in Islam, those who are unwell are excused from attending congregational prayers, including Friday prayers. Muslims were also advised to set aside the practice of \"salam\" to avoid the transmission of the virus. Some temples and churches in Singapore are scaling back or suspending mass and regular services, and urging followers to watch their services online instead. I really appreciate the guidance provided by the religious leaders to rally the community together in this current situation.As we try to prevent the transmission of this virus, there is an even greater threat that we must fight, that is, the spread of fake news. According to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study, fake news can travel six times faster than true stories. In the past month, false information on the closure of schools and an MRT station due to the spread of COVID-19 was propagated. It is important to remember that, whenever you receive messages or unsubstantiated information over WhatsApp or other social media platforms, please do not forward or circulate them.Please ensure that you check the information you receive against official sources, like the government websites and official news releases. If you are unsure, do not spread the information. We have to be disciplined in the fight against fake news. All in all, Singapore can and will overcome this COVID-19 situation if Singaporeans are ready, psychologically resilient and support the efforts by the government and businesses to deal with this outbreak. We should not be easily rattled and instead, be confident as a people. As my soldiers often say \"Relax, Don't Be Stressed Out!\"3.00 pm(In English): Mr Chairman, the spread of falsehoods during this COVID-19 crisis is just one example of how fake news can damage our society, erode communal trust and social cohesion. Ms Joan Pereira asked how MINDEF is supporting the whole-of-Government efforts to prepare Singaporeans to combat the spread of online falsehoods and fake news.As part of a broader effort to raise information literacy and increase Singaporeans’ understanding of digital threats, MINDEF, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), National Library Board (NLB) and Cyber Security Agency of Singapore had worked together to add a Digital Defence component to the SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace programme. The enhancement to the programme will equip participants with the skills to detect and deal with fake news and digital threats. At the same time, MINDEF/SAF has partnered NLB to enrich our existing BMT curriculum with content on cyberattacks and information threats. Now, BMT recruits will have to complete an e-module on Digital Security in the SAF and visit the Digital Defence exhibition at the Singapore Discovery Centre. Students who joined the 2019 N.E.mation! competition had the chance to visit the SAF Cyber Defence School, which equips the MINDEF/SAF's cyber workforce with skillsets and knowledge for deployment in cyber defence entities, to learn about the SAF's cyber capabilities and contributions to keep Singapore's network systems and infrastructure safe and secure. They also visited The Straits Times’ newly revamped newsroom to learn how ST detects and deals with fake news.Online falsehoods can also affect the reputation and credibility of businesses and even cause serious financial losses. A case in point is Tesla. Last January, Tesla's shares and consumers' confidence in their products were affected when fake videos claiming that Tesla's cars were unsafe were circulated online. Mr Henry Kwek asked about the initiatives targeted at business owners to equip them to deal with digital threats. One of the many efforts to achieve this is a collaboration between MINDEF, SSG, the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) and NLB to introduce a Digital Defence component into the SUSS SME Resilience, Entrepreneurship and Nurturing programme to teach small- and medium-sized enterprise business owners how to use the S.U.R.E. (Source, Understand, Research and Evaluate) framework to better assess the reliability of information. We conducted one session last year and the feedback on this has been very positive so far.While we do our utmost to defend Singapore against digital threats, we have to acknowledge that it is impossible to prevent all cyber and data incidents, especially by determined and capable adversaries. Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Seah Kian Peng asked about MINDEF's efforts to strengthen cyber security against potential threats and attacks on our security systems. MINDEF/SAF is doubling down on efforts to raise the cybersecurity standards and readiness within the entire defence sector, including our vendors and among MINDEF-related organisations like SAFRA and NSRCC. We will limit the amount of data they hold and ensure implementation of technical and procedural measures to protect the data during transmission and storage. In addition, I am happy to announce that the first batch of Specialists from the Cyber NSF scheme has been deployed into our cyber defence operations across MINDEF/SAF. The Defence Cyber Security Centre (DCSC) which was announced in 2019, has also reached 24/7 operating capability to monitor, detect and respond to threats. The DCSC will coordinate operations across the defence sector and integrate cyber threat intelligence capabilities.While we step up efforts in digital defence, the multi-faceted threats of today mean that to keep Singapore strong, we need the collective effort of all aspects of society – Government, businesses, communities and individuals like you and me, across every Total Defence pillar.Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about MINDEF's efforts to engage the community to strengthen resilience against potential threats. MINDEF is working with PA to introduce the Total Defence Achiever Badge programme this year for the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), which currently includes 2,000 active volunteers. To achieve the highest tier of this programme, CERT volunteers will have to attend lessons to learn how to identify fake news, community mediation and psychological first aid, among other training components. In this way, CERT volunteers will be better equipped with the knowledge and skills to respond to the evolving nature of emergencies, thereby putting Total Defence into action.Dr Teo also asked for an update about the Government-led and community-led efforts to strengthen Total Defence. I am happy to share with the House that the community has, in various ways, taken ownership of Total Defence. One example is the collaboration between four NTU students, Coding Lab and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to develop a Total Defence board game within the Tiny Thinkers Starter Kit, which were given to pre-schoolers and parents of low-income families, with the aim of exposing young children to Total Defence.As noted by Ms Joan Pereira, in many countries, education on the importance of resilience and emergency preparedness starts at a young age. In Singapore, to anchor Total Defence for our next generation, MINDEF collaborated with MediaCorp artiste Edmund Chen and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) to create \"My Little Red Dot – Making Our Home A Better Place\" book. Through this book, young children can learn about Total Defence in an interactive manner and parents are encouraged to share values, such as unity and resilience, with their children.Mr Chairman, key to Total Defence is a strong SAF – our military defence pillar. For a small country like Singapore, the only way to have a credible military of sufficient size is to have a conscript force, where every able-bodied male Singaporean defends Singapore, thereby contributing to military defence. Earlier, Senior Minister of State Heng Chee How had talked about this extensively. I believe that strong family and societal support for our National Servicemen will motivate them to give of their best when performing their duties. To recognise and strengthen family support for all our servicemen, I am happy to announce that MINDEF and MHA will launch the SAFRA Family Scheme and HomeTeamNS Family Scheme this year. Under these schemes, Operationally Ready National Servicemen can sign up for a family package for himself and his dependants, regardless of the size of his family. This allows significantcost savings because servicemen no longer need to pay individual membership fees for each dependant. We hope that this will encourage more families to visit SAFRA and HomeTeamNS clubhouses, enjoy the facilities and spend more quality time together. SAFRA and HomeTeamNS will announce more details on this in mid-2020.Last month, we launched the new Total Defence logo – the winning design, by Ms Samantha Teng, an Allied Educator. Mr Seah Kian Peng asked about the significance of the new logo and how Singaporeans responded to the call for the design of this new logo. In Ms Teng’s design, the arrows pointing upwards represent Singapore’s continuous journey to stay resilient against current and future threats. When we launched the logo competition, we wanted to create a new logo that represents all six pillars and, more importantly, to hear from Singaporeans what Total Defence meant to them. We were heartened to receive more than 600 designs by participants from all walks of life – from students, teachers, professional designers and retirees.Global trends and threats are evolving and, as Mr Seah Kian Peng noted, one of the issues our youths and many young people around the world are increasingly concerned with is climate change. Given that Total Defence has kept Singapore strong for more than 35 years, it is timely for us, as a nation, to revitalise this all-round defence and deterrence strategy to address these threats confronting Singapore now and in the future. We will continue partnering fellow Singaporeans to seek ideas on how to strengthen our Total Defence because this should be a whole-of-nation effort. As part of the SG Together movement, MINDEF will conduct a series of engagement sessions in the second half of 2020, to hear from Singaporeans on how all of us can do better to put Total Defence into action and how Total Defence can be strengthened for our future.This will also allow younger Singaporeans to reflect on what Total Defence is to them and operationalise this as we respond to future threats and challenges.In conclusion, Mr Chairman, although the COVID-19 outbreak has not ended, I believe that the collective effort from the Government, communities and individuals will see us through this crisis. We must continue to encourage the community spirit shown during this period and support those at the frontline. It is with this collective strength that we are able to stay resilient and united as one people. We must make Total Defence in every Singaporean's DNA. With a strong Total Defence, we have every reason to have confidence and a sense of hope for Singapore's future.The Chairman: Clarifications? Ms Sylvia Lim.Ms Sylvia Lim: Thank you, Chairman. Two clarifications for the Minister for Defence regarding our purchase of the F-35s. Earlier, the Minister mentioned that US Congressional approval has been obtained for the purchases. Do I understand that this is the in-principle approval that is needed and that the formal terms of the sale and purchase are still being negotiated and finalised? That is the first clarification.The second clarification concerns his acknowledgement that there had been some technical issues with the plane and he mentioned that, to ensure that our defence dollars are well-spent, the timelines that are available to us will be useful. Could he elaborate a bit more about this aspect?Dr Ng Eng Hen: First, on the process which is specific to the US requirements, the US DoD has to support, which they have. The administration has to support, which they did when we submitted our letter of request. On the Congressional side, it is not so much approval, but they can raise objections, which they have not.So, basically, those processes have been done and the Member is quite right, we are at a stage where we are doing the terms of the sale and purchase agreement which will include aspects beyond the purchase of the F-35s for us – where we would like to base them when we are training together with the DoD and so on and so forth. I have said that we are in the final stages and we are. If all things proceed as we planned, then we will acquire it in 2026, we think.For the second part of Ms Sylvia Lim's question, by the time we acquire it in 2026 or beyond – we have evaluated the first four F-35Bs that we have acquired and then made a decision – I think, in production, you would probably have, for F-35s and F35Bs, across the world a few thousand platforms used by many, many militaries.3.15 pmThat is a good position. In other words, there are many vested interests for many countries who plan their air defence systems based on that acquisition.With new platforms, not only with the F-35s but also F-16s and F-15s, you will always have design issues, operational issues. So, the assessments, of course, will be done technically as well as with our pilots. Basically, for us, in the Ministry, we have to ask questions and satisfy ourselves that there is a rigorous technical assessment. But if you speak to the pilots and the technical side of the house, they are quite confident that the main problems have been ironed out and that the platform will reach a steady state in which it is operational.There are some issues related to maintenance and parts and so on, but that is logistics. What I meant was that it is good that we are in no hurry and we have to allow the systems to mature. I think most of the issues that were raised initially when the F-35 procurement was in its infancy would have been ironed out.Mr Vikram Nair: I think the Minister mentioned there were three imminent threats: terrorism, cyber security and maritime threats, of which the most difficult to plan and deal with would be cyber. But the current plan is for the cyber security to be dealt with under the SAF and reporting to the Chief of Defence Force (CDF). Would the Minister also consider having a force outside the SAF to deal with this, particularly, so that it can tap talent which may not want to be in the military, such as the white hats or people with talent in this area?Dr Ng Eng Hen: That is a good question, Mr Chairman. The cyber arena is enormous and there is a whole-of-Government approach where there is a committee which Senior Minister Teo chairs, looking at the overall picture, not only for cyber but business continuity under various aspects, logistics, so on and so forth. So, that is the whole umbrella. There are various agencies dealing, for example, with cyber threats. The SAF is one component of it. So, let us situate what the SAF does.And, of course, we have the Cyber Security Agency, which is primarily responsible for protecting our networks and they were very involved when there was a – some Members here talked about data ex-filtration, rightly so – they were the ones. There are other Government agencies.For the SAF, it would be similar to identifying threats as we do in the kinetic world, in the real world – air, land and sea. In other words, if there are state and non-state actors who are using the cyber realm to first infiltrate, then to decimate, to diminish our will, as a precursor, for example, to a kinetic move, as we talked about, a hybrid. A few years ago, I mentioned to this House this concept of hybrid warfare, which was surfaced by some military experts. We see it as the SAF's responsibility to identify these external threats.For example, if there is a terrorist plot, first, to capture our population. Not necessarily jihadists. It could be any religion. To capture acolytes for their movements, as a long-term plan or even a medium term plan. We ought to be able to identify that. And together with that, information warfare, then to gather arms or to have plots or to commit sabotage. So, I think there has to be a central role for the SAF, which is similar to what we have defined as our role in protecting Singapore's sovereignty and stability. So, that will be the context.Now, having defined our missions, then, who do you need? There are pros and cons, for example, even within the SAF and MINDEF context. We have talked about this. Is this better uniformed or non-uniformed? The comfort for any Minister or indeed, anybody who oversees the security for MINDEF and SAF is that the SAF is the quickest to mobilise. All of us know that. When you push a button, you know that the SAF can move. Whereas other units, there is a little bit more discussion, I think. But we also want it to be effective and efficacious, as well as efficient.So, I think that we have settled that it should be the CDF to see C4I. As to how you raise them and what type of people you need, you are quite right, and that is why this committee will look at the recruitment processes. We take that for some, it would be similar to what we raised, for example, technicians in the technical force, but not quite similar; and there will also be certain, I suppose, they sit on the right side of the curve, they are very brilliant, but you do not know whether they can sit nicely in uniform and whether they can adapt to it. I think you know what we are talking about. So, there are these considerations which, over time, I think, we will be able to address.Mr Chairman: Mr Vikram Nair, would you like to withdraw the amendment?Mr Vikram Nair: I thank Minister Ng, Senior Minister of State Heng Chee How and Senior Minister of State Mohamad Maliki bin Osman for your comprehensive review of our defence. It has been quite an interesting development in our SAF with all the threats evolving, and I think we would also wish to thank our men and women in uniform who serve and protect us. Thank you all, and I seek leave to withdraw my cut.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $14,561,155,500 for Head J ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $889,200,000 for Head J ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates."

        "Content": "Resumption of Debate on Question [2 March 2020],\"That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". – [Mr Liang Eng Hwa].Question again proposed.The Chairman: Minister Chan Chun Sing.The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing): Mr Chairman, Singapore has faced challenging economic situations triggered by disease outbreaks before – SARS in 2003; H1N1. Through each episode, we internalised important lessons, strengthened our collective resilience and emerged stronger.Today, COVID-19 is badly hurting our tourism and aviation sectors. International visitor arrivals may fall by more than 25% this year. Retail and food services have also been severely affected. The disruption of supply chains has also slowed the recovery of the manufacturing sector, especially electronics.The eventual economic impact of COVID-19 could be worse than SARS as China now accounts for more than 19% of global GDP and 27% of global manufacturing value added. The quantitative and qualitative impact of China’s slowdown and the potential of a global pandemic cannot be under-estimated.Many of us are concerned how the COVID-19 situation will affect our livelihoods. I want to reassure Singaporeans that the Government’s immediate priorities are to help our businesses stay afloat and to help our workers stay employed. To this end, we have introduced a comprehensive set of relief measures in the Stabilisation and Support Package.Measures like the Enhancement of the Enterprise Financing Scheme – SME Working Capital Loan will support businesses with cash flow issues that may arise in the short term. The $1.3 billion Jobs Support Scheme and the $1.1 billion enhancement of the Wage Credit Scheme will safeguard employment and wage growth.Mr Chairman, beyond the measures to address the immediate challenges ahead, we must also aspire to emerge stronger, be one of the first to recover and seize the new opportunities. This Government is committed to not just the present, but also our future.Our most immediate task is to rejuvenate the tourism and related sectors. The Singapore Tourism Board or STB has formed a Tourism Recovery Action Task Force (TRAC), comprising leaders from both the private and public sectors. We will also commit resources to support the upgrade of hotels and attractions during this period of lower activity; we will anchor a strong pipeline of leisure and business events in the recovery; and we will step up marketing efforts to reach new sources of tourists.International investors remain committed to Singapore as we forge ahead with plans to enhance our attractiveness as a tourism destination. Large-scale tourism projects such as the Integrated Resorts expansion, Sentosa-Brani Masterplan and rejuvenation of the Mandai precinct all continue to make good progress. They will contribute to the growth of our tourism sector in the medium term.Beyond tourism, we must also press on with our efforts to transform our economy for tomorrow. Mr Teo Ser Luck and Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about MTI’s plans for the longer term. We must prepare for two sets of long-term driving forces.First, we must prepare for the reordering of global supply chains. Technology, especially digital technologies; rising trade tensions and protectionism and now domestic resilience to disease outbreaks have all added impetus to the reordering of the global supply chains.All companies, big and small, local and multinational, have to fundamentally re-examine the resilience of our supply chains. Diversification of supplies, manpower sources and markets are not options – but imperatives.The ensuing contest to attract top investments and talent will be intense. Developing countries with plentiful land and labour are cuttingcosts aggressively. More developed countries are poaching top executives and building their very own Smart Cities to rival Singapore. The OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative, or BEPS 2.0, will also impact how countries compete for investments.To differentiate ourselves, we can no longer rely on tax incentives alone. Instead, Singapore must continually build real and new capabilities, augment our Singapore Core with global talent and find new ways to anchor key economic activities here.The second driving force, technology. We are undergoing technological advancements in multiple fields – medical, robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. These are not just incremental shifts, but disruptive and discontinuous change.The emergence of new technology provides us with new economic opportunities and challenges. Sectors in which we did not have a comparative advantage before, like agri-tech and new urban mobility solutions, are now emerging opportunities.On the flipside, technology is now challenging sectors which are well established in Singapore. Banking is being disrupted by the rise of FinTech. Retail is increasingly displaced by e-commerce. Some legal, consultancy and IT services can now be delivered electronically across borders.Whether we can win depends on two things. Externally, whether we can extend and enhance our connections; internally, whether we can adapt our environment and businesses to the two forces of global supply chains being reordered and emerging technology.To emerge stronger globally, Singapore must continually enhance our value as a connectivity hub.We need to adapt to changing supply chains by expanding and upgrading our network of FTAs. In November last year, we concluded text-based negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). If all goes well, we hope to sign this agreement by the end of this year to deepen connections between ASEAN and other RCEP Participating Countries, which together account for almost 30% of global GDP. We are also making progress in FTA negotiations with the Eurasian Economic Union, MERCOSUR and Pacific Alliance.Our FTAs have provided our businesses access to billions of consumers beyond Singapore’s shores by reducing tariffs and lowering non-tariff barriers. In response to Mr Teo Ser Luck's question, our 25 FTAs are with economies that represent more than 85% of global GDP. Having FTAs in different regions facilitates diversification and enables our businesses to capitalise on opportunities around the world.The benefit of each FTA goes far beyond our economic relations with the other party. Our FTAs enhance our ability to compete for investments as a network of 25. Companies which operate in Singapore can use our FTAs to build up supply and value chains which are resilient to single-market disruptions. At the same time, many companies also find it advantageous to access the Southeast Asia region and the world through Singapore. This creates many opportunities for businesses in Singapore and allow them to create good job opportunities for Singaporeans.Mr Leon Perera asked about the FTA negotiation process. In order to achieve the best outcomes for Singapore, we consult and involve many different stakeholders – including trade associations, unions and business chambers in the lead-up to the negotiations. Post FTA implementation, we continue to engage industry and regularly enhance our trade agreements, where possible. For example, we upgraded our FTA with China to provide our businesses with new benefits like enhanced investment protection and greater access to China's legal, maritime and construction services sectors. We also upgraded our FTA with New Zealand last year, and now businesses can clear their goods through New Zealand Customs much faster.We also adapt our trade agreements to the emergence of new technologies. For example, we have started work on Digital Economy Agreements, or DEAs as we call them. By guarding against digital barriers and by addressing issues that arise from emerging technology such as Artificial Intelligence, DEA provides a trusted environment for trade in the digital era. I am pleased to note that we have substantially concluded DEA negotiations with Chile and New Zealand. Negotiations with other like-minded partners, including Australia, are also progressing well.10.15 amAs we enhance our trade agreements, we must also help our companies to take advantage of them. Mr Douglas Foo , Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Teo Ser Luck  asked how we can do more to support businesses in seizing opportunities in the region and beyond. In 2019, Enterprise Singapore supported 2,600 enterprises. Moving ahead, we will significantly strengthen our support to companies that want to go international, in five ways.First, we will extend the enhanced 70% support under the Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) for another three years, till 31 March 2023. To better support companies who are new to internationalisation or are expanding into new markets, the grant cap will be raised to $100,000 per new market, per company over the enhancement period. We have also expanded the scope of eligible activities to include in-depth FTA consultancy services and support for additional overseas business development activities such as thecost of deploying a staff overseas.Second, we will extend the Double Tax Deduction Scheme for Internationalisation (DTDi) for another five years, till 31 December 2025. This will encourage more Singapore companies to increase their market development and investment activities overseas. The enhancements will now cover new categories of expenses incurred for third party consultancy and overseas business missions.Third, we will launch the Grow Digital initiative under the SMEs Go Digital programme to help SMEs grow their business overseas via both B2B and B2C digital channels to access new customers and markets. For a start, the programme will focus on China, India and Southeast Asia. Minister S Iswaran will share more details at MCI'sCOSdebate.Fourth, we will work with the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) to launch the GlobalConnect@SBF in April. GlobalConnect will be an international advisory centre to provide dedicated market access support for companies new to internationalisation, with a focus on Southeast Asia and the emerging markets.Fifth, we will increase the support levels for young Singaporeans under the Global Ready Talent (GRT) Programme so that more graduates can take on work opportunities abroad and gain exposure to Southeast Asia, China and India. This will strengthen the pipeline of local talent to support businesses in expanding overseas in the medium to long term.Mr Teo Ser Luck will also be pleased to note that our suite of internationalisaton support goes beyond providing financial support. We also focus on the facilitation of knowledge transfers to companies, as suggested by Mr Teo.Through a network of overseas centres, Enterprise Singapore works closely with companies to provide advisory support and in-market assistance. They also run frequent seminars to equip SMEs with essential knowledge to embark on their internationalisation journey.To better understand the industry, we have been seconding Public Service officers to Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) through the Local Enterprise and Association Development or LEAD Programme. These officers have been actively involved in helping the TACs spearhead new internationalisation projects for the industries and we will do more where we can to second more officers to the TACs.These measures will help Singapore compete internationally. But they must be complemented by measures to strengthen ourselves internally, so that we can harness the two global trends to emerge stronger. Specifically, we must emerge stronger through innovation, transformation and doing it together as an entire eco-system.Let me start with innovation. Public investment in research and innovation has grown over the last 25 years. This puts us in a good position to harness the technological revolution and turn old constraints into new opportunities.We have a small population, less than 1% of ASEAN. So, we leverage on advanced manufacturing sector to propel ourselves from a labour-intensive industry to one empowered by Industry 4.0 technologies. This has also allowed us to establish our niche in producing \"high mix, low volume, high quality and knowledge intensive\" products, entrenching our position in the global value chains.We have limited land. So, we leverage agri-food technologies to transcend both size and geography, producing high-value crops like strawberry and kale on this sunny island.We have a finite carbon budget. So, we explore innovative solutions to transform waste into value-add products. This has allowed us to couple environmental sustainability with economic prosperity.Going forward, we must do more to translate Singapore’s research edge into an economic advantage. We have earmarked $300 million to support startups in key emerging technology areas like pharmbio and advanced manufacturing. We will also continue to drive the adoption of technologies through the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) and to seize new opportunities in emerging sectors especially in the Deep Tech sector. My colleague, Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon, will elaborate.The use of technology must be complemented by the transformation of business processes. We recognise that not all enterprises are at the same stage of development. But regardless of your stage of growth, you will have a fair chance to succeed. We will customise our assistance to our enterprises' needs and level of ambition.For local enterprises with high growth potential, we will provide dedicated support to deepen their capabilities, enabling them to become leaders in their respective fields. An example of such dedicated support is the new Enterprise Leadership for Transformation (ELT) Programme.For smaller enterprises, we will enhance access to the wide array of enterprise-centric enablers, through channels like the SME Centres, the TACs and the GoBusiness platform.For Heartland Enterprises, we will provide additional assistance, through schemes like Heartland Enterprise Upgrading Programme (HEUP), so that they too can have a good shot at growth and expansion. Our assurance to all Singaporean business is this: so long as you have the drive and you have the ambition, we will partner you, as necessary. My colleague, Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat, will elaborate on these schemes.Finally, to emerge stronger, we must do so together, as One Team Singapore.Over the years, we have established a strong tripartite partnership amongst the Government, the TACs and the unions. This partnership is critical. As key touchpoints to businesses and workers, TACs and the unions help provide the Government with crucial ground sensing and feedback on key economic policies.Moving forward, we will do more to strengthen our partnership with TACs to drive industry transformation efforts. My colleague, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Tan Wu Meng, will elaborate.Mr Chairman, we are committed to sharing the benefits of economic growth with all Singaporeans and improve their lives.Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Desmond Choo asked about how efforts to grow the economy have translated into positive workers' outcome.When we grow the economic pie, we create good jobs. More than half of our local workforce is made up of PMETs. This is one of the highest proportion in the whole world, and the number of PMET jobs continues to rise – from about 1.2 million in 2016 to 1.3 million in 2019.We also share the fruits of economic growth. Real median income for Singaporeans grew at 3.7% per annum from 2016 to 2019, which is higher than the 3.2% per annum in the preceding three years.Economic growth is necessary to create good jobs for Singaporeans, but I must say this does not happen naturally. The critical link between growth and jobs is skills. Singaporeans must have the right skills to take on the jobs that growth creates. The Government has put in significant investment in our education and training system over many years.We now have strong pre-employment training (PET) and continuing education and training (CET) systems, and our SkillsFuture movement, which are all well-regarded globally. There are capability building programmes to transfer overseas capabilities and expertise to our local workforce, such as the Capability Transfer Programme.We have also placed strong emphasis on grooming local leaders within key sectors. Mr Leon Perera would be pleased to know that the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative or LDI, has supported over 1,000 Singaporeans in acquiring corporate leadership competencies and experiences. In particular, the ASEAN Leadership Programme (ALP) will equip our business leaders with the knowledge and network to ride on the growth of Southeast Asia.However, as Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, employers must have the right mindset for these programmes to succeed. They need to start investing in our local workers and to prevent an over-reliance on foreign employees. Only then will we be able to improve the localisation over time.Indeed, we must not and we must never be complacent. Today, many have jobs that did not exist a mere decade ago. We are preparing for future jobs that do not yet exist now. The rate of technological change will only quicken. If we do not support our workers in refreshing and advancing their skills, not only will they lose employability over time, businesses will suffer, and our economy will lose its competitiveness.We are particularly aware of the concerns amongst our mid-career workers, those in their 40s and 50s. Job security is of utmost importance to them. They have significant financial commitments as they provide for their families, often with school-going children and retired parents. Many of them have completed their formal education more than 20 years ago and they have moved on in their careers in one company or various, and may not have the opportunity to reskill and upskill.Those who are employed now are worried if they will still have a job in the near future because of keen job competition and also the technological disruption. Those who have been retrenched are worried if they can re-enter the workforce and find a job that matches their skillsets and pay expectations. In 2018, only 58.6% of resident workers aged 40 and above managed to re-enter the workforce within six months after retrenchment – lower than the 70% for those in their 30s.Mr Desmond Choo , Mr Henry Kwek and Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked what more can be done to support mid-career workers in their 40s and 50s. This needs to be done at the tripartite level – businesses offering more employment and upgrading opportunities; workers making an effort to re-skill and the Government supporting businesses and workers in their endeavours. So, all three parties must pull our weight together in order to get this done.I will talk about the support for businesses in general. Minister Iswaran will share more details of mid-career training programmes for the Info-Communications and Technology (ICT) sector at MCI'sCOSdebate later. Minister Josephine Teo and Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat will also elaborate on plans to increase reskilling capacity and to help workers make career transitions at the MOM and MOE'sCOSdebates respectively later today and tomorrow.Through the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package, we have set ourselves the target to double the annual job placements for locals in their 40s and 50s to 5,500 by 2025. I will now share three key ways in which companies can play an important role in supporting this national effort – redesign, re-skill, and recruit.First, redesign. Businesses should seek to actively redesign their jobs to create new opportunities for existing and new workers, including those in their 40s and 50s, even as they pursue enterprise transformation. As part of the Next Bound of SkillsFuture, businesses can now tap on the enhanced Productivity Solutions Grant or PSG, which now includes consultancy services for job redesign. We want to make job redesign a key component for enterprise transformation.Second, re-skill. As Mr Desmond Choo noted, when businesses grow and transform, they have an important role to play in actively re-skilling their workers rather than poaching from others.The Next Bound of SkillsFuture will also see an enhanced focus on businesses driving enterprise and workforce transformation in tandem. Under the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit or SFEC, eligible employers will receive a one-off $10,000 credit to cover up to 90% of out-of-pocket expenses for supportable enterprise development and workforce transformation programmes, including re-skilling and job redesign. Three thousand dollars of the SFEC will be reserved for the latter. My colleague, Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat, will elaborate.This is also why, from 1 April this year, worker outcomes will be included as a mandatory condition for companies that apply for Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) funding. These outcomes may include wage increases, creation of skilled jobs for Singaporeans, job redesign and workers' training.Third, recruit. Businesses need to offer suitable placement opportunities for our mature workers. The Government will support by giving a Hiring Incentive to employers who hire local jobseekers aged 40 and above through eligible reskilling programmes. Such programmes include Professional Conversion Programmes or PCPs, Place-and-Train (PnT) programmes and career transition programmes by SSG's CET Centres. For each eligible worker, the Government will provide 20% salary support for six months, capped at $6,000 in total.10.30 amI urge all employers to come forward, transform their business, and at the same time create new opportunities for all workers including our older workers. This has always been a critical part of our growth strategy and an important chapter of the Singapore Story.Mr Chairman, if there is anything we have learnt from past challenges and the current COVID-19 situation, it is that we should never under-estimate the strength and resilience of our people. As we battle COVID-19, we must also strive to emerge stronger.The journey ahead is full of both opportunities and challenges. But if we stand together – Government, businesses, unions and citizens – I am certain we can overcome any challenge and emerge stronger to chart a better future for all in Singapore. And this year's MTI tagline is: \"to emerge stronger\".The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon): Mr Chairman, as a small and open economy, Singapore must be nimble and responsive to developments in the global economy, in order to maintain our competitive advantage. Innovation is key to doing this.We will foster innovation in Singapore by strengthening our innovation eco-system and leveraging innovation to transform our industries and seize new growth opportunities. We will strengthen the innovation eco-system to help companies harness technological change and bring new ideas to market. Ms Foo Mee Har asked about the research landscape in Singapore. As part of the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 Plan (RIE2020), we provide strong support to our companies in their innovation activities, including translating research into commercially viable products.We have established technology consortia, which bring together companies and public sector researchers to collaborate on research projects. Companies can join these consortia to keep up with research trends and tap on the expertise of our many researchers.Our Centres of Innovation (COIs) that Ms Foo asked about, provide specialised expertise to help companies translate problem statements into technology requirements. This accelerates their product development process. The COIs have supported over 4,200 such projects in areas such as technical consultancy, product development and intellectual property commercialisation.Mr Lee Yi Shyan asked about our digital eco-system. In addition to our strong research and development capabilities, we are also constantly building up other aspects of our pro-innovation eco-system, including access to skilled global talent and a vibrant startup eco-system. We have also set up the Digital Industry Singapore (DISG) last year to better coordinate Singapore's efforts for the digital industry. Our suite of value propositions has helped us to grow our tech sector, where we have successfully attracted digital giants such as Google, Facebook and Alibaba.These strong inter-linkages between research, innovation and enterprise do not just serve a pure commercial purpose. In fact, they have been essential to tackling the COVID-19 scourge that we are facing right now too. Take Kronikare, an AI start-up that is based locally. Kronikare has an AI wound monitoring software to help patients take care of their wounds. When COVID-19 struck, Integrated Health System Information (IHiS), the IT arm for our public healthcare sector, partnered Kronikare to quickly re-engineered this core technology to develop an automatic fever detection solution to aid other businesses in the fight against COVID-19.Start-ups like Kronikare play an important role in the innovation eco-system. They bring new ideas to the table and spur industry to do things differently. Over the past four years, through schemes like Startup SG Equity, the Government has catalysed over $560 million in private sector funding into Singapore-based start-ups, helping them with product development and bringing these products into market.Mr Teo Ser Luck asked about how we identify which start-ups to invest in. Investing in start-ups is inherently risky and the Government does not possess enough information to make these assessments alone. This is why Enterprise Singapore (ESG) co-invests with private sector investors who have the expertise in assessing the commercial value and viability of start-ups.For deep-tech start-ups, it is especially important to have access to such funding that is backed by deep industry knowledge. As Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Ms Foo Mee Har noted, such start-ups typically require larger investments and have longer gestation periods, because of the multiple iterations of prototyping and pilot production that are needed. In fact, for medtech and pharmbio products, they would usually require quite a period of time for clinical trials and validation for safety and efficacy, before they can be introduced into the market. Clearly, not all moonshot projects will succeed. But when they do, when these moonshot projects succeed, they break new ground and give fertile foundation for future incremental innovations to succeed thereafter.We will therefore enhance the Startup SG Equity Scheme to help our deep-tech startups in the areas of pharmaceuticals, biotech and medtech, advanced manufacturing and agri-food tech. To ensure they have the necessary resources to bring their products to market, Deputy Prime Minister Heng shared during Budget that we will be topping up S$300 million to the scheme. We will also enhance the scheme to double the maximum amount each start-up can receive, from S$4 million to S$8 million.A portion of the S$300 million will be allocated towards investing in a global Venture Capital or VC fund, through a new \"fund-of-funds\" approach. This not only increases the availability of investment funds, but also attracts experienced VCs into the Singapore eco-system. Our deep-tech start-ups can then tap on their expertise, knowledge and networks to accelerate their growth, such as seeking guidance on commercialisation and business operations, and importantly, meeting new business partners.To encourage funds and fund managers to invest a larger proportion of their funds into Singapore-based start-ups, we will also extend the relevant tax incentives by five years. This also includes enhancements such as expanding the types of investments and incomes incentivised and streamlining of the requirements to invest in Singapore-based enterprises.Mr Chairman, innovation is not only about investing in R&D but also about transforming our industries to be relevant for the future. Mr Lee Yi Shyan and Mr Leon Perera have spoken on Industry 4.0 or I4.0. I4.0 will have a deep impact on our industries, particularly in Manufacturing.Over the years, manufacturing in Singapore has evolved to compete based on the deep skills and capabilities of our companies and our people, and the use of technologies such as robotics and automation. Our initial efforts have allowed us to anchor I4.0 activities from some of the best manufacturers in the world. Two of Singapore's factories, Micron and Infineon, joined the World Economic Forum's Global Lighthouse network as trail blazers earlier this year. This accolade is only offered to advanced manufacturers who show leadership in applying I4.0 technologies to drive change.We will continue to support companies in their efforts to adopt innovative solutions through a multi-pronged approach. As a start, we launched the Smart Industry Readiness Index (SIRI) and the SIRI Prioritisation Matrix in 2017. Since then, more than 250 companies have undergone the SIRI Assessments and among them, about 30% of them were SMEs. The SIRI Assessments help our companies understand where they are at in their manufacturing transformation journey and to prioritise the improvements they need to make.Another prong of our strategy is to build platforms that foster interaction and collaboration within the manufacturing ecosystem, to adopt I4.0 technologies. Mr Leon Perera and Ms Foo Mee Har asked about networking platforms and industry collaboration.To build a regional community, Singapore has been hosting Industry Transformation Asia Pacific (ITAP), the Asian Edition of Hannover Messe, the world's largest industrial trade fair. ITAP has provided a very useful platform to help companies to connect, discover the latest trends in technology and exchange best practices. We introduced a learning element into the 2019 edition, to ensure that our enterprises, workers and even our students were able to learn about I4.0 through guided tours and on-site learning labs.Beyond single touchpoints and events, we are also developing the Jurong Innovation District (JID) as a dedicated advanced manufacturing campus for different players along the value chain, such as researchers, technology providers and businesses, to work together on new ideas. It will also serve as an area for SMEs to collaborate with our MNCs and larger enterprises. Over the next 20 years, companies in the JID are estimated to create 95,000 new jobs in research and advanced manufacturing activities.For our next phase of transformation, we will leverage on what we have learnt from our Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) and explore synergies across the different sectors. This will allow us to identify more opportunities within the clusters to promote innovation, to deepen capabilities and importantly, to encourage partnerships.To build on these efforts and give more local companies a boost in innovation, I am happy to share that we will launch a new SIMTECH Innovation Factory in the JID. This will be a co-working space to help companies ideate and design their own unique products. For a start, there will be a focus on equipment design, medtech devices and electromechanical modules. It will be equipped with the necessary tools for companies to prototype their designs and will have resident design and technology experts to help companies through their innovation journey.This is very useful for SMEs when they do not have the scale or the necessary technical expertise to do this on their own. So, we hope this will be a real boost to our SMEs to up their innovation capabilities. After successfully designing their own products, companies can then go on to one of two of A*STAR model factory facilities for pilot production of these new products.To fully seize opportunities in I4.0, companies must also train and upskill their workers. I4.0 is not just about equipment, is not just about technology. Our experience implementing the ITMs has shown that industry transformation is much more effective and pervasive when there is participation and ownership by the workers. The Labour Movement has been advocating that for I4.0 to succeed, there must be Worker 4.0. We will do more to enable this.We recently launched the SkillsFuture Work-Learn Bootcamp for Engineer 4.0. This is a three-year pilot programme that will train and place up to 200 engineers in areas such as lean manufacturing and the Internet of Things.We have also introduced the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit, with a portion reserved for training and job redesign, to encourage companies to invest in their workers.Sir, innovation is also about turning challenges into economic opportunities. Just as we had turned our vulnerability with water into a strength, we can do likewise with climate change as Miss Cheryl Chan and Ms Anthea Ong have discussed. We can do so in two ways.First, by reducing our carbon footprint. Last week, Senior Minister Teo announced the Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) which details Singapore's approach towards a low carbon future, and how our industries and Singaporeans can contribute to this global effort.The Energy and Chemicals sector is a valued pillar of Singapore's economy, contributing 2.3% of our GDP and employing around 26,000 workers in 2019. We have been working closely with companies in the industry to ensure that new or upgraded facilities meet higher levels and higher standards of efficiency.Companies, such as ExxonMobil, are also taking active steps to improve their energy efficiency. From 2002 to 2018, ExxonMobil's efforts to reduce their energy consumption in Singapore have led to energy efficiency gains of over 25%. This is equivalent to the removal of more than 550,000 cars from Singapore's roads.Miss Cheryl Chan would also be pleased to know that there are existing platforms to facilitate exchange of best practices, such as those organised by industry associations like the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS). We also organise the annual Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW), which brings together global policy makers, think tanks, industry experts and leaders to discuss trends and challenges in the energy landscape. We will continue to encourage such exchanges.10.45 amSecond, by developing new sustainable solutions. Given the increasing demand globally for sustainable products and services, there are economic spin-offs to be captured here. Today, we ensure resilience in our energy supply by encouraging our natural gas importers to diversify and import from multiple sources. This addresses the energy security concerns that Mr Leon Perera has raised. Our LNG terminal has the capacity to cover all our gas demand even if our piped natural gas supply were to cease today.On nuclear energy, countries that deploy nuclear energy have to be accountable to their populations and their regions and ensure that high safety and security standards are adhered to. We are working with ASEAN countries to strengthen cooperation on nuclear safety and emergency preparedness as well as response systems.But security is not just about ensuring the robustness of our current energy supply. It is also about looking at our energy future. Hence, we welcome Ms Anthea Ong's suggestions on studying the potential of renewable and alternative energy options. Such reviews are important because they provide useful insights on how we can work with companies to overcome the growth risks and capture economic opportunities arising from global climate change developments.One area of growing interest is the idea of a circular economy. A \"circular economy\" seeks to improve resource efficiency and recycle resources in a loop to maximise their value. JTC is thus partnering with companies on Jurong Island and other Government agencies, such as NEA and PUB, to conduct a Jurong Island Circular Economy Study. The study will map out flows of water, energy and waste on the island and identify system-level gaps. This will allow companies to come together to develop solutions to address these gaps, testbed solutions on Jurong Island and then export these solutions globally.Individual companies across diverse industries can also benefit from adopting a circular economy concept. In the food manufacturing sector, for example, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) has helped to connect food businesses with tech solution providers to convert food waste into higher value products.Last week, I visited SinFooTech, a food technology company co-founded by two young entrepreneurs, Jonathan and Jian Yong. When I spoke to Jonathan, he shared how their patented fermentation technology upcycles soy whey, a food waste by-product of tofu manufacturers, into a much higher value-added alcoholic beverage named Sachi.This is the first alcoholic beverage in the world to be made from soy whey and it was fascinating to understand the science behind how soy whey, a waste product from tofu manufacturing, can be converted into an alcoholic drink with a slight fruity, sweet and floral taste. And if you have a chance to, you should try it when they finally start their commercial production. I am glad to hear that SinFooTech is looking to sell their technology licence overseas and will be setting up a factory to scale up their production of Sachi.Companies like SinFooTech contribute to Singapore's broader agri-food tech industry. This is a sector of growing importance as the world looks for innovative solutions to feed our growing population amidst climate change and resource constraints.Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Ms Foo Mee Har asked how the Government will support the development of emerging sectors. Last year, I announced that we will establish an Agri-Food Innovation Park (AFIP) in Sungei Kadut to allow leading high-tech farming operators to testbed and commercialise their technologies. Infrastructure and land preparation works for Phase One of AFIP have started and we will be ready to welcome companies by the first half of next year.The Government must be prepared to relook at our rules and regulations as we grow new sectors. As with any new sector, there will be a learning curve for both businesses and the regulator. But we must not be afraid to try.Even before the setting up of AFIP, agencies such as the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and ESG, have already been engaging the Singapore Agro-Food Enterprises Federation and other farm operators to address the issues that they have faced with existing regulations. This includes areas that are important for agri-food tech operations, like building infrastructure, fire safety and other regulatory issues.So, we will expand these efforts into a new regulatory sandbox for High Tech farms at AFIP. This will allow us to review more regulations for AFIP tenants even more quickly in a more streamlined manner. The lessons learnt from the sandbox will then be extended to benefit the wider farming industry.As we help our agri-food tech companies to increase their food production capacity through the use of high-tech farming equipment, we must also help them to access new markets and expand their customer base overseas. This is why we have started an inter-agency workgroup, the Food Regulatory Connectivity Initiative, to develop Singapore as a trusted food trading hub.We will work with trading partners to boost recognition of Singapore’s food regulatory system and improve market access for food produced in or exported through Singapore. We are also partnering accredited private bodies based in Singapore to provide the necessary checks that fulfil foreign import requirements. For example, we are engaging China's regulators on the recognition of meat and seafood products. This will help Singapore companies to export their food products to new markets which previously did not permit this.As we continue to anchor and seek out new growth areas, new exciting jobs will be created. And I hope to see Singaporeans seizing opportunities to work in these exciting sectors.To conclude, Mr Chairman, innovation is key to our continued success. Our resilient and agile economy was not built overnight. It is the product of strong and consistent investment over many decades. Not every individual project or enterprise will succeed but, collectively, we will move forward. We must not be afraid to venture into new frontiers to reap undiscovered rewards, for present and future generations.In the years to come, we will continue to strengthen our innovation ecosystem and transform our industries through innovation so that Singapore and Singaporeans can continue to thrive.The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat): Mr Chairman, last year, I spoke about the three Ups: Level Up – to strengthen enterprise and workforce capabilities; Scale Up – to help enterprises grow locally and abroad; and Team Up – to enable enterprises to achieve better outcomes together. Let me update Members on our progress, beginning with Level Up.Our enterprise development schemes provide holistic support to firms of different sizes and at different stages of growth. They improve businesses’ and workers’ productivity, and help them to harness technology, innovate, upgrade their skills and internationalise.Members have highlighted that successful enterprise transformation must go hand-in-hand with skills upgrading and workforce training. I fully agree. The Deputy Prime Minister mentioned in the Budget Statement that we are introducing the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. Each eligible employer will be given $10,000 in credits, valid for three years from 1 April 2020, to cover up to 90% of out-of-pocket expenses for enterprise and workforce transformation programmes. This will benefit over 35,000 enterprises, which hire more than 1.5 million local workers.How can firms benefit from the credit? They can offset out-of-pocketcosts for transformation projects. This is over and above the 70% co-funding support under the Enterprise Development Grant and Productivity Solutions Grant. They can also use the credit to help them redesign jobs under the enhanced Productivity Solutions Grant and redeploy workers to more productive and meaningful roles. Third, firms can use the credit to send their workers for approved training courses, including design-related courses.Sir, good design matters to all businesses and industries. I agree with Mr Henry Kwek that our workers can benefit from these skills. The value of design goes beyond aesthetics. Like technology, design is a critical enabler for innovation and value creation. Design-led approaches can help to solve complex issues and drive business transformation. Companies like Apple and Dyson have pioneered superior technology. But what makes them stand out is their ability to integrate technology with innovative human-centric design.The DesignSingapore Council (Dsg) is now part of EDB and the MTI family. Dsg launched the Skills Framework for Design last year, together with SSG and WSG. We will form the Design Education Advisory Committee on 1 April to enhance design skills training for our workforce. It will be chaired by Mr Low Cheaw Hwei, Head of Design at Philips. This will complement existing Design courses offered by our IHLs and training providers.These add to our existing initiatives to help companies. For example, a traditional logistics SME can benefit from free subscription under the Start Digital pack for six months to access more customers through digital marketing and e-commerce; receive up to $30,000 in support from the Productivity Solutions Grant to implement inventory and fleet management solutions; enjoy up to $100,000 from the enhanced Market Readiness Assistance programme for each new market the business is expanding into; and also receive SkillsFuture support for up to 90% of course fees to upskill their employees.Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked about the impact of such schemes on productivity. We believe enterprise transformation must start with what the business wants to achieve, what problems it wants to solve and what capabilities it wants to build to reach its goals. The assistance to companies must be enterprise-centric and transformation-focused, based on their needs.Our approach has achieved good outcomes so far. Enterprise Singapore supported more than 13,000 projects from over 11,000 enterprises last year. These will generate $17.3 billion in value-add and create 21,700 new PMET jobs and also positive outcomes for existing workers. Productivity improvement, innovation and internationalisation remain important pillars of our economy; and we must press on with these efforts. In doing so, we will regularly review our policies and schemes and we will continue to engage economists in the private sector and academia.Sir, I shall move on to the second \"Up\" – Scale Up. We will help businesses to expand locally and overseas. Mr Charles Chong asked how SMEs can improve their awareness of the support available and interact easily and efficiently with the Government.Minister Vivian spoke about the GoBusiness Licensing portal, a collaboration between the Pro-Enterprise Panel, GovTech and SNDGO. It provides a simpler, faster and better way for food services companies to apply for all relevant licences. It is not just about using IT, but as Minister Vivian explained, to re-engineer our rules and procedures, make them more efficient and more pro-business and save businesses time and money.We are further developing GoBusiness to be the platform for enterprises to transact with the Government. We will include other sectors like retail. For example, applying for change-of-use licence is one challenge faced by many retail businesses. They may not know which agency to approach and the type of business activities already permitted in their existing premises. Through GoBusiness, a company will be able to check such information by entering its postal code. The company need not apply for a licence if the activity is already permitted. This will save time and money. If a licence is required, the company can then proceed to do so through the portal.The platform will also integrate other transactions beyond licensing, such as helping entrepreneurs to start new businesses and seek Government assistance. We will introduce an e-adviser. This is a joint project by MTI, GovTech and SNDGO, in collaboration with SME Centres and businesses. Instead of going through multiple sources to gather information on different Government schemes, a company can visit the portal and answer a set of questions. The e-adviser will then recommend suitable schemes based on what the company needs.Those who require further assistance can meet with a Business Advisor at an SME Centre. In 2019, the SME Centres assisted over 28,000 companies. We will enhance our SME Centres as partners for business growth, to provide more in-depth support for promising SMEs. Business Advisors will work with these enterprises to develop long-term business plans and chart the next steps together.Mr Teo Ser Luck asked about the selection criteria for Scale-up SG. Scale-up SG is for companies of different sizes and industries – we have companies from F&B, cleaning and retail. Besides a high level of commitment from the management team to embark on an ambitious growth plan, ESG will look at the company’s track record, its commitment to grow its presence in Singapore and the potential to create economic spin-offs for Singapore and generate good jobs for Singaporeans.Learning from the early success of Scale-up SG, ESG will launch a new Enterprise Leadership for Transformation (ELT) programme later this year. The Deputy Prime Minister touched on this as part of Budget 2020. ELT is a three-year pilot programme that supports business leaders of promising SMEs to achieve their next bound of growth. Mr Douglas Foo asked how the participants will be chosen. Companies may apply to the programme. Applicants will be selected based on their demonstration of ambition and commitment and also their growth potential.ELT will be designed and delivered together with partners such as the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), professional firms and banks. The programme lasts about a year and it will include business coaching and practical learning components. Participating local enterprises will receive up to 90% funding support for their programme fees.11.00 amMr Foo, who is also President of Singapore Manufacturing Federation, has suggested involving TACs as ELT partners. I welcome his suggestion. Indeed, the business networks of TACs will be very valuable and can support peer learning and collaboration. We look forward to working with our TACs.This brings me to the third prong of our strategy – Team Up. We want companies to Team Up to build deeper capabilities and accelerate their growth. One area is the review of Government rules and regulations. Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about our approach in doing so.Over the years, the PEP has partnered industry, businesses and Government agencies to make close to 1,200 improvements in rules and regulations. These have reduced time, effort andcosts for businesses, and improved our overall economic competitiveness. The PEP also partners TACs to organise Pro-Enterprise Clinics to identify regulatory pain points and support innovative ideas from businesses.Earlier, Senior Minister of State Koh mentioned SinFooTech. It is a food technology company which converts soy whey into alcoholic beverages. The company wanted to set up a research facility to experiment with new products. However, it faced highcosts – distillery licence fees and excise duties. PEP and Singapore Customs worked together with the company, and after reviewing its proposal, Customs agreed that SinFooTech need not pay excise duties on its research products, as long as these are not sold commercially. Thiscost saving will be about $90,000 over six months for the company.Customs also extended its pro-rated licence fee framework for microbreweries to distilleries like SinFooTech. Instead of paying the annual licence fee of $28,000, it can now pay a pro-rated fee of $7,000 per quarter; quarter by quarter. If it wants to stop after one or two months because the experiment is not going well, it can get a refund for the remaining licence period. These features help to lower the entrycost for companies to try new ideas, and also reduce the exitcost if they decide to end their pilot early.When we work together with businesses to review our rules and regulations, the improvements will benefit many other enterprises. They can launch innovative ideas more quickly and lower their operatingcosts. Government agencies also benefit from having more efficient and business-friendly rules.We see our role as a gate-keeper and not as a goal-keeper. What is the difference? A gate-keeper assesses the risk and decides who to let through and who to turn away. Whereas a goal-keeper's mission is to prevent all balls from getting through. If we block all new ideas that push against our existing regulatory boundaries or have a risk of failing, there will be no innovation.Listening to feedback and being open to new ideas, feeling comfortable to take calculated risks, and experimenting together with industry partners to turn ideas into reality – these are important aspects of Public Service Transformation; in line with the SG Together Movement.Sir, Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Teo Ser Luck askedabout heartland enterprises, which serve important social and economic roles in our society. In my maiden speech in Parliament, I spoke about how we should work together to rejuvenate our heartland precincts and shops. Sir, please allow me to continue in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Over the years, MTI and ESG have teamed up with industry partners to drive heartland precinct rejuvenation and enterprise transformation. Last June, we set up the Heartland Enterprise Centre Singapore (HECS) and set it three main objectives – to uplift precincts, transform enterprises and upskill workers.Since then, the HECS has done good work, and helped many heartland enterprises and Merchants' Associations (MAs). For example, it helped:a) The Ang Mo Kio MA to promote and broadcast its Chinese New Year festivities on social media, increasing footfall to the precinct;b) The Bedok MA to add vibrancy to the town centre through lighting installations and displays; andc) The Chong Pang MA to develop a dedicated online marketplace for shops in the precinct, to increase their sales.For 2020, I have challenged the HECS to achieve a \"triple five\" stretched target:a) To partner at least five new precincts, in addition to the three they are supporting currently;b) Secondly, to help 200 enterprises with their transformation and digitalisation, which is five times more than the 40 last year; andc) Thirdly, to train 1,000 workers and shop owners, which is five times more than the 200 last year.We will introduce the Heartland Enterprise Upgrading Programme (HEUP), as a single integrated support package for MAs. Under this programme, MAs can receive dedicated support from ESG, HDB, and HECS to develop and implement 4-year action plans. These plans will cover upgrading of common area infrastructure, organising placemaking activities, and the upgrading of enterprises and workers.We will also provide enhanced support to MAs through the programme. Firstly, we will increase the support for placemaking activities from 50% to 70% and cover a wider range of activities andcosts. We will also increase funding support for the upgrading of common areas from 80% to 90%, reducing thecosts for shop owners.In addition, currently under HDB's Revitalisation of Shops (ROS) scheme, the support of all shop owners is required for upgrading works to commence. We are considering amending the legislation to lower the threshold from 100% to 75%, to allow works to proceed if at least three quarters of the shop owners are supportive. This will allow more precincts to benefit.(In English): Mr Chairman, the Government will help businesses and workers tide over the immediate challenges due to COVID-19. We are also committed to support businesses at different stages of growth to transform and prepare for the future, so that our companies and our workers will emerge stronger.Through economic growth, we have achieved employment growth and wage growth for our workers, and improved the lives of Singaporeans. Real wages have grown by 3% per year in the last 10 years and young people are able to secure good jobs. In the 2019 graduate employment survey results for University and Polytechnic students, more than 90% found employment within six months of graduation, with higher median salaries than previous batches.The outcomes we have achieved are the result of effective policies, hard work and good governance, underpinned by a stable political system and strong tripartite partnerships; as well as a forward-looking Government that plans long term and does not shy away from telling the truth, even if it is unpopular. A Government which places Singaporeans at the heart of everything we do.This is an important component of our Singapore Story: how we grow as a nation, how every generation builds on the foundations laid by previous generations and takes the country further to benefit future generations.This is how we must continue to forge ahead – always striving for improvement – Keeping Singapore domestically united and globally connected; and never giving up in the face of adversity. As we say in Hokkien, \"pah buay si\", and if I may add, \"pah si pun boh zao\" or to have a never-say-die attitude in Hokkien.The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng): Mr Chairman, Sir, if I may beg your indulgence, in case we overrun by a little bit.The Chairman: All right.Dr Tan Wu Meng: Sir, we all play a part in keeping Singapore's economy going. We appreciate the good works of our Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs). They are a store of social capital with their institutional memory, shared experience and industry networks.I agree with Mr Douglas Foo that our TACs help the Government to better understand the needs of our business community, and partner us to develop industry. Mr Foo, Mr Teo Ser Luck, Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about the Government's plans to help TACs and companies expand into new markets.Last year, Enterprise Singapore started developing strategic roadmaps with our TACs, to help them adopt longer-term plans to transform industry. The first roadmap is with the Singapore Business Federation (SBF). As Minister Chan shared earlier, GlobalConnect@SBF will be launched this April. It will scale up SBF's capabilities and resources to help our Singapore-based companies access new markets overseas. To start, SBF will organise seminars, trade fairs and business missions to help businesses grow in Southeast Asia and they will do this for emerging markets as well across the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa.SBF's international advisory centre will also answer companies' enquiries about internationalisation and the use of Free Trade Agreements. Because when our businesses take flight, it grows our economy's international wing of the economy. It creates more opportunities for fellow Singaporeans at home and abroad and furthermore, COVID-19 has also been a stark reminder of the need to diversify across multiple markets.The Government will equip TACs with more resources to support companies in their transformation journey. Enterprise Singapore will pilot the two-year Executive-in-Residence programme. This is to help TACs engage experienced executives to guide companies in business transformation and growth. Participating TACs will help to identify, engage and match the executives with companies based on their needs. Our TACs will also need to upgrade their workforce and capabilities, which Mr Douglas Foo asked about. TACs can tap on the Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) programme to strengthen their leadership and secretariats, and improve organisational processes.Several have done so, such as the Federation of Merchants' Associations Singapore and the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and there will be many more to come. Sir, let me now speak on consumer protection. Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about errant retailers that attempted to profiteer from the COVID-19 situation.Let me say this categorically. Profiteering is wrong. We recently exercised our powers under the Price Control Act to ask two retailers, which had received public complaints about profiteering. We asked the two retailers to show us the basis of their prices. The retailers subsequently apologised and reduced their prices. We will continue to monitor the situation.Mr Lim also suggested ways for the Government to deter unfair practices. We will study his suggestions, but there is also a need to balance between consumers' interests and a pro-business environment, because our fellow Singaporeans include entrepreneurs and business owners as well.Sir, we will continue to strengthen consumer protection in three ways. First, review our laws on competition and consumer protection, to ensure they continue to be effective in deterring unfair practices. This will help consumers make better decisions and help companies to continue competing on a level playing field. Second, raise industry standards. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore has developed a set of guidelines on the Dos and Don'ts in price transparency for all consumer-facing industries. This will reduce the risk of consumers being misled. These guidelines will apply to both online and offline transactions and will be published in due course.Third, promote consumer awareness and empowerment. Mr Lim Biow Chuan had raised the question of charge-back issues. I assure Mr Lim that consumers can seek assistance on charge-back issues through their credit card issuers' hotline. And there are also ongoing efforts to raise awareness on the charge-back process.The websites of credit card issuers, the Association of Banks in Singapore, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) and MoneySENSE – all these have Frequently Asked Questions on the process of resolving common credit card disputes including charge-backs. Sir, we also believe in empowering consumers with information to make well-informed purchasing decisions, because better information means better choices.CASE piloted the Price Kaki app featuring crowdsourcing insights on prices at supermarkets and hawker centres across Tampines, Toa Payoh and Jurong West starting from September 2019. What does crowdsourcing mean? It means that people at supermarkets, people looking for cooked food, can share information about prices and bargains, so that other users can share the information from it as well. We could say, \"by users\", \"for users\". Since its launch, we have seen 15,000 registered users, more than half a million crowdsourced entries from users. And all this, across just three towns in Singapore. Imagine if we had it across the island. I am pleased to announce that the Price Kaki app will be rolled out across Singapore in the coming months. With this crowdsourcing network, everyone can have a buddy, everyone can be a buddy. You might say, \"Long zhong wu kaki, long zhong si kaki\" or we all have buddies in Hokkien.Furthermore, Price Kaki helps people who has less time, who are less aware of market prices, who are less experienced shoppers. It is an app for everyone across all walks of life, but especially people who may be starting with less. It is a progressive move to build a more fair, more equitable society. We hope you can benefit from the app, whether contributing as a kaki or benefiting as a price kaki. Mr Chairman, in Mandarin, please.11.15 am(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]We understand and care for your concerns with regard tocost of living issues. CASE will be launching the Consumer Empowerment Panel (CEP) in April to look into matters oncost of living. The panel will work together with associations, unions and grassroots leaders, to engage and help consumers like you stretch your hard-earned dollar.(In English): Mr Chairman, in English, please. Sir, we are a small island, a little red dot in a changing world. And sometimes, the world outisde throws challenges at us. And to face these challenges, it takes all of us, because when we pull together, we are stronger. In Mandarin, \"众人同心，其利断金\"。In Malay, \"berat sama dipikul, ringan sama dijinjing\".We have seen this in the fight against COVID-19. Nurses and doctors on the frontlines, working day and night, round the clock, to protect us from the outbreak. Volunteers, at mask distribution centres in the community, delivering masks to the homes of neighbours who are less mobile.Our Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) and companies are doing their part too. Last month, when demand surged for essential commodities, the Singapore Food Manufacturers' Association teamed up with six other associations to increase domestic food supply. E-commerce companies, with the help of Enterprise Singapore, shared delivery vans to cope with increased demand for delivery throughout Singapore.And, Sir, we will continue supporting our TACs and other industry groups to help companies get through today's economic uncertainties and prepare for tomorrow's recovery. We will introduce the SG-Together Enhancing Enterprise Resilience programme, otherwise known as STEER, which will match $1 for every $4 raised by industry-led funds, up to $1 million per fund.The Singapore Furniture Industries Council will be launching its members' assistance scheme this week as part of this, supported by Enterprise Singapore through STEER, and more than 250 of their members will benefit from the scheme to strengthen business capabilities and market diversification.Mr Chairman, in conclusion, we are all in this together – you and me, the people around us, our TACs, our fellow Singaporean businesses, Government. All of us in this together. And this is how, as a nation, we can survive and thrive, no matter what odds the world throws at us. This is how we keep on creating new possibilities for a better, brighter Singapore. This is how, together, we can make a difference, because together, we can, and together, we will overcome.The Chairman: Clarifications. Mr Liang Eng Hwa.Mr Liang Eng Hwa: Sir, two clarifications. Yesterday, the Restaurant Association Singapore issued a statement reminding landlords to pass on the property tax rebates that they will be enjoying to the retailers. There are other retailers who are not happy that the landlords are not making it clear on passing on these rebates. So, can I ask the Minister if he is concerned that the good intention of the Government – which is to help the retailers impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak – is not being followed through by the landlords? And whether any measures can be taken to urge the landlords to pass on the rebates?Secondly, I appreciate Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat's reassurance that the Government will continue to strengthen our pro-enterprise environment. While stifling regulations can work against the enterprise eco-system and addcosts, but we also know that adequate regulations do protect consumers, set high standards, build trust. In our context, regulations can be both a competitive advantage and a competitive disadvantage. Can I ask the Senior Minister of State to share a bit more where we should lean to and where is that sweet spot?Mr Chan Chun Sing: Mr Chairman, let me take the first question and Senior Minister of State Chee will answer the second one.Yes, we are aware that there are some issues between the retailers and the landlord. Let me just say this. We are all in this together – the whole Singapore economy depends on businesses – the landlords, the retailers, everyone working together.Since the Government announced the rebates and the help to the businesses, it has come to our attention that there is an entire spectrum of responses.On the positive side, we have seen landlords who have proactively gone out of their way to share the rebates with their tenants. And, in fact, a few of them have gone out of their way to take into account the tenants' reduced turnover to help them more, and I applaud these landlords. But on the other hand, it has also come to our attention that there are some landlords that are still taking a bit of time to roll out their packages. To this end, the Enterprise Singapore is in close consultation with both the Restaurant Association of Singapore and also the Singapore Retailers Association (SRA) to help them work with the major landlords. I would like to urge all the major landlords to do our part together to help each other to get through this difficult moment.And I would say this to the landlord. The relationship between the landlord and the tenant is a long-term relationship. When the tenants do well, the landlords do well; when the landlords do well, they need to share it with the tenants. Only so can we continue to do well as One Team Singapore. It will be very short-sighted for landlords to try to stinge and save a bit here and there, instead of passing on some of the benefits to the tenants. This is a long-term relationship and Singapore is not that a big an economy. I think every one of us will have long memories of who are those who have come forward to do their part for their business partner in this difficult moment and who are those that have taken a very short-term perspective to this.Enterprise Singapore will continue to work closely to arbitrate between the landlords and also the tenants. In fact, I must thank Enterprise Singapore officers who have been working very hard over the last one week, day and night, trying to urge both sides to come to terms with each other.At the same time, I must say that, for the tenants who are affected, they are not all affected equally and we should try to give a bit more help to those that are more affected by the downturn caused by the COVID-19. And if we can do this all together, we will go past this stronger together.Mr Chee Hong Tat: Mr Chairman, I thank Mr Liang Eng Hwa for his supplementary question. Indeed, I think there is a need to strike a balance and that is why I use the analogy of a gatekeeper. Someone needs to watch the risks – what are the downsides. And every proposal that comes needs to be assessed carefully. What are the benefits? What are the downsides? What are the risks involved? What is the impact on stakeholders, consumers and other businesses?So, this is a process which we do on a case-by-case basis. Whenever we get a proposal from businesses, we will work together with the regulatory agencies to understand what is the rationale for the current rules, can it be improved and enhanced, can the process be better?The example, I would give Mr Liang is this: you build a ship and the safest place for the ship maybe to park it in the harbour. But we know that is not why we built ships. We built ships because we want the ship to be able to bring us to different places around the world, but the ships need to be safe. So, how do you do it in such a way that will allow us to look for new opportunities and new areas, but still remains safe, the quality must still be maintained. Because that is a very important part of our economic competitiveness.Our trusted brand name, quality assurance, people think that when they walk into Singapore, they have the confidence that things work well here. And what we want to avoid are the two extremes – free for all; nothing at all. There is a sweet spot, as Mr Liang mentioned, somewhere in the middle. But where that sweet spot is, that one we have to evaluate on a case-by-case basis. We have to look at it.That is why it is so important for us to do this in partnership because when we understand what the pain points are, based on the feedback from our businesses, and we understand also the rationale for the rules and regulations from our regulatory agencies, then I think there is scope was to see how can we innovate together, how can we improve the rules and processes together.So, that is where I think we are aiming for. Mr Liang asked me about where is the balance we want to strike. I think that balance is what we want to aim for and the process will be as part of Public Service transformation, as part of engaging our businesses, our Trade Associations and Chambers, to do it together.The Chairman: Assoc Prof Walter Theseira.Assoc Prof Walter Theseira: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I thank Senior Minister of State Chee for the reply to the cut. I have two clarifications for him.First, I would like to understand the Ministry's findings on the effect of grant schemes a bit better. Is the claim that the outcomes, such as the $17.3 billion in value-add, is that attributable solely to Enterprise Singapore (ESG) support? In other words, what is the marginal contribution of public funding? Because the concern here is that it could just be a substitute for private funding. In that case, not a good use of taxpayer money.The second clarification is, what is the extent to which public grant schemes have contributed to recent improvements in total factor productivity (TFP) growth? This was in the cut but not directly addressed just now.Mr Chee Hong Tat: Sir, first, I think the contributions to our productivity, to our economic growth, I think I will be overstating it if I say it is all due to the grants from ESG. It cannot be. A large part of it, actually, the main part of it is due to the hard work and the entrepreneurial drive of our businesses. The business owners must be, first, at the forefront of this. If they do not have good ideas, they do not know how to transform their business, they do not know what to do with the various resources that they have, I do not think any amount of Government grants will help them.So, that is why I think we pay a lot of attention to helping businesses with good growth potential, with the commitment and ambition, to see how we can help them to go further. But it has to start with the business owner having that drive, the ideas, the resilience and the resourcefulness to be able to pool these ideas together and produce a service or a product that will meet the needs of its customers.The issue of TFP, Sir, I must first qualify that even though I did some economics in school, my level of economics is nowhere near Assoc Prof Theseira. But based on my understanding, TFP is a residual indicator, in a sense that you look at what is the change in GDP that is not attributed to changes in capital and labour inputs. So, because it is a residual indicator, the changes in TFP, first, it could be due to a range of different reasons; and second, it is more meaningful to look at it over a longer period of time because of the ups and downs. Because of that, we do not just look at TFP; we also look at other indicators to guide us, in terms of whether our schemes are working, to provide the feedback on whether our schemes are working. These are indicators, such as value added, jobs created – especially jobs for Singaporeans – investments that we could attract and also what is the value added per worker. We use a mixture of indicators to provide a more complete picture.The Chairman: Ms Anthea Ong.Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would like to thank Senior Minister of State Koh for addressing my cut, particularly in terms of the economic transition to decarbonisation. I have three clarifications.Do we know when the risk to economy from high carbon sectors will become pertinent? That is number one.What are our plans to invest in deep industrial efficiency, CCUS, which is carbon capture storage and utilisation, or low carbon hydrogen to not only just mitigate the risk to our economy, but also to create new jobs? That is number two.11.30 amI think Senior Minister of State Koh mentioned that there are 26,000 workers currently employed in the petrochemical industry. I assume a large number of them are actually locals. I am wondering how are we re-skilling this high carbon industry jobs to prepare for the kind of jobs that we can expect which we do not know now, in the next decade, as Minister Chan mentioned.Dr Koh Poh Koon: Sir, can I get Ms Anthea Ong to repeat her first question because I did not quite catch that.Ms Anthea Ong: The risk – when were the risks to our economy from this high carbon sector become pertinent?Dr Koh Poh Koon: At this moment these situations are still evolving because the technology for many of the low carbon alternatives are still quite nascent. They are still not exactly mainstream. Things like carbon capture, utilisation, carbon storage, hydrogen fuel cell technology, for example. All these things are still technologically undergoing development and they have not gone to mainstream yet. So, I do not think we have reached the inflection point where we need to actually transit aggressively into alternative energy sources.For new jobs, one of the key things is to make sure that we continue to work on our ITM together with the industry. The ITM for the energy and chemical sector is a tripartite effort between the oil majors or the people owning the refineries in the energy sector, together with the union as well as the workers. The idea is to make sure that we involve these tripartite partners into looking at what their transition plans would be over the longer term. And then working out step-by-step what kind of new jobs would be created in the interim, what kinds of skills are needed and then very, very targetedly training the workers today to continue to take on new skill sets so that as the new jobs come about, whether it is through efficiency measures, putting in new technology that changes the way they work, then the skills of the workers are relevant for these news that come about. So, I hope that gives you a kind of sense of where we are implementing some of this technological change to our workforce. I hope that answers the bulk of the Member's questions.The Chairman: Mr Liang, would you like to withdraw your amendment?Mr Liang Eng Hwa: Sir, I would like to thank Minister Chan Chun Sing, Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat, Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Tan Wu Meng for the comprehensive response to our cuts. Indeed, our economy is facing, among the most daunting challenges and circumstances in recent years, with serious implications on jobs and business survivability. So, it is reassuring that MTI as well as the Budget 2020 measures are there to help the businesses to tide through this period. We wish the MTI team every success in steering our economy forward and to emerge stronger. With that, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment, Sir.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $1,316,531,400 for Head V ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $6,541,521,000 for Head V ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates."

        "Content": "Fiscal Management and TransformationMr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah): Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".Sir, I sit in Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC). Every year, the Committee would scrutinise the findings listed in the Auditor-General's report. While we do not expect zero gaps and weaknesses for a government machinery of this scale and complexity, what concerns the PAC Members is that many of the audit issues brought up in the Auditor-General's report were recurring items that happen year after year. For example, lapses in procurement and contract managements, weaknesses in IT controls and gaps in management of grant programmes.Some of the lapses this year concerned the PAC Members so much that Permanent Secretaries from four Ministries were also asked to meet the Committee to explain the reasons for the lapses and what are the detailed follow-up measures taken to address the lapses.The PAC was concerned that given the increasing size and complexity of the work in the public sector, such lapses, if not addressed fundamentally, may compound over time and weaken the governance and accountability over the judicious use of public funds and resources.Can I ask the Minister on the role that MOF plays in ensuring good governance and accountability within the Public Service? How does MOF ensure that value-for-money practices and culture are strongly embedded in the public service? Also, does the Public Service track and measure the effectiveness of Government spending for better decision-making?Sir, Budget 2020 clearly demonstrated that prudence and disciplined financial management will always pay off for Singapore. The accumulated surpluses in the last four years for this term of Government gave the Finance Minister the fiscal firepower and the critical resources to decisively respond to the virus outbreak and help businesses and Singaporeans that are impacted by the crisis in a timely way.We have very ambitious spending programmes and plans ahead in the decade ahead, including big-ticket infrastructural items like the Cross Island MRT line, Terminal 5, the ramp-up in healthcare infrastructure, climate change adaptation projects and so on.How do we ensure that the Government will spend carefully and prudently on these mega items? Given its complexity where the projects may cut across Ministries and agency lines, how would the Government ensure that there will be no overlapping of efforts andcosts? Are there clear working protocols established to streamline and harmonise the whole-of-Government efforts here?Finally, I would like to ask the Minister to update on efforts to transform the public service processes, in particular, how MOF intends to leverage on digital capabilities as well as the community partners to deliver more thoughtful and joyful services to businesses and to citizens.Question proposed.Fiscal Sustainability and AccountabilityMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Mr Chairman, fiscal sustainability and accountability and the use of public funds are important, so good financial stewardship is essential for Singapore for years ahead, given the more challenging environment we have for many years down the road.In the Budget, the Deputy Prime Minister highlighted plans to set aside funds for an initial injection of $5 billion for the new Coastal and Flood Protection Fund, $1 billion for building up the Government’s cyber and data security capabilities and there are also further plans to build new housing estates, increase the green cover in the residential estates and so on. These are all major projects that will be implemented over a number of years. How are we ensuring that the Government spends prudently and appropriately on big-ticket infrastructure and IT projects such that our financial stewardship would be put in good stead, going forward?4.45 pmMs Foo Mee Har (West Coast): Mr Chairman, with the anticipated rise in expenditure, it is important that the Government ensure fiscal sustainability and accountability. Singapore's strong financials have been instrumental in enabling the country to carry out audacious development projects, as Deputy Prime Minister Heng said just now. So, what is the scope, within our budgetary mechanisms, to ensure this trajectory and to ensure inter-generational equity, balancing the needs of current and future generations, especially for big-ticket items like infrastructure and climate change?Most fundamentally, a healthy and growing economy will be crucial to ensuring a healthy revenue stream. The Government has invested substantial funds to support firms to transform and grow under the Industry Transformation Programme. The Government has also allocated a significant share of the Budget to R&D and RIE investments.I would like to ask the Minister what measures are used to determine if these investments are indeed bearing fruit: what KPIs are used to track progress and success? What has the impact of investment in R&D been, in elevating and positioning Singapore for the future and in supporting industry transformation?Sir, Government Ministries can also contribute to the sustainability of Government finances. They should be expected to practice prudence in their spending and seek the best value for the money they put into their projects. I would like to ask the Minister what budget mechanisms and controls are deployed to manage expenditure growth in Government, ensuring efficient and effective spending of public monies and the sharing of best practices. How does MOF ensure value-for-money is the responsibility of every Ministry and every public officer?I would like to ask the Minister what incentives there are for Government officers to under-spend their budgets and continuously achieve savings in projects and initiatives for which they are responsible? What mechanisms are in place to ensure budgets are efficiently and effectively allocated, and to what extent can the whole-of-Government approach be used to explorecost synergies and cross-agency collaboration, in order to avoid duplication of effort andcost?Sovereign Wealth FundsMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member): Mr Chairman, Sir, in 2017, I asked a Parliamentary Question (PQ) about succession planning in Temasek Holdings. The reply was that these matters are to be dealt with by Temasek's Board and the Government does not interfere because Temasek operates as a commercial entity. In 2019, my Parliamentary colleague, Mr Png Eng Huat asked about whether remuneration bands can be disclosed for senior officers in sovereign wealth funds or SWFs. And again, the reply was similar.The reason this is problematic is that the two entities are not privately-held commercial entities in which case the stance would be understandable, but public ones managing public funds. The public has a legitimate interest in understanding for instance, why CEO succession was deemed to be enough of a priority in 2009 to appoint a CEO designate, and yet, there has not been any concrete movement or succession on the 11 years since then, in spite of what one must assume would be no lack of suitable candidates internally or externally; or whether remuneration given to top executives is consistent with market norms and represents good value.In contrast, the Singapore code of corporate governance calls on listed companies to disclose total remuneration paid to the top five key management personnel. A 2018 study found that close to 70% of Singapore listed companies did so. The SGX and most of the exchanges do not take the view that the disclosure of such information is unnecessary in the public, and shareholders only need to know past financial performance and nothing else, because such disclosure has a bearing on likely future performance and risks among other reasons.Singapore Exchange Regulation Chief Executive Tan Boon Gin said, and I quote, \"Shareholders, especially minorities deserve to know why company directors and executives are paid the way they are.\" \"The Board and Management therefore owe it to investors to explain the link between performance and remuneration.\"The same reasoning would apply to our SWFs because the Government is the shareholder, the people of Singapore are, by implication, stakeholders. In the case of the Norwegian SWF, the government questioned the rising operating expenses of the SWF publicly. The compensation of the CEO and CIO of the Norway fund are publicly known.In passing, let me note that I am not holding up the Norway model as one we should emulate in all respects. That is not my point. I am also not calling for Government interference in the commercial operations of the SWFs. That is not my point.I would like to ask how Singaporeans are able to obtain a reasonable degree of accountability and transparency over matters relating to business succession and top executive compensation at our SWFs which manage hundreds of billions of dollars of public funds. Would the Government consider, at the very least, allowing a bi-partisan Parliamentary Committee to interview the key personnel from these SWFs once a year so that there is some degree of accountability to legislators?Ministry's Role in Industry DevelopmentMr Lee Yi Shyan (East Coast): Mr Chairman, Sir, one of the key trends shaping Singapore's future is the rapid advancement of technology. Artificial Intelligence, 5G, Robotics and blockchain and so on, are poised to disrupt existing industries, eliminating jobs and create new ones.According to McKinsey, applying AI to nine business functions in 19 industries has the potential to create between US$3.5 trillion and US$5.8 trillion in value annually. Growth projections for 5G, Robotics and blockchain technology applications are similarly breathtaking. Traditionally, economic development is predominantly the responsibility of MTI, but increasingly, several other Ministries are overseeing vertical domains which are filled with opportunities for innovation, technology applications and industry development. For instance, MND has deep knowledge of planning a smart and sustainable city, MCI for smart nation, MOT for driverless transportation, MEWR for clean energy and water solutions, MOF for Fin Tech, and MOH for telemedicine. In all these areas problem solving will require multi-disciplinary knowledge employing the new technologies I just mentioned. These Ministries are in very good position to champion R&D applications and industry development in their respective domain expert areas.Would MOF therefore consider, when allocating budgets to Ministries, set aside a certain percentage of the Budget for Ministries to take on mandatory industry development roles, including technology planning, R&D and enterprise development within their vertical domains? After all, building an advanced knowledge economy is a complex task well beyond the expertise of any single Ministry.The Chairman: Mr Louis Ng, you can do both your cuts together.Providing Single Unweds with Parenthood Tax Rebate (PTR)Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): Sir, MND stated that \"single unwed parents are valued citizens, and like all parents, are respected for the love and care they provide for their children. They are no less a mother or a father, just because their child was born outside of marriage.\" Why do they not then get the parenthood tax rebates like other parents? MND also stated that \"every parent regardless of their marital status, ought to be treated with respect.\"Our policies can help end the discrimination. It is time to level the playing field and treat single unweds with respect. As citizens, they should qualify for the Parenthood Tax Rebates like all other parents. Next cut.Providing Working Mother's Child Relief (WMCR) to Single UnwedsThe Working Mother's Child Relief rewards families with children who are Singapore Citizens. Why leave out single unwed families? Why only encourage married women to remain in the workforce after having children?It is strange that we do not want single unwed women to remain in the workforce after having their child. Why discriminate, even after MND has stated again that \"every parent regardless of their marital status, ought to be treated with respect.\"Let us respect single unwed mothers who look after their children single-handedly and remain in the workforce despite all the difficulties. Will MOF consider allowing single unweds to qualify for the Working Mother's Child Relief?Foreign Domestic Worker Levy Tax ReliefMr Png Eng Huat (Hougang): Sir, no one likes to raise a child alone be it the mother or the father who has to take on the role by choice or by fate. Whether it is the case of a failed marriage or the untimely death of a spouse, the burden and responsibility of single parenthood is a long and arduous journey to undertake. I have seen a number of single parents at my Meet-the-People sessions over the years. While most of them were women, there were single fathers who came along with the children in tow.The story they share about raising their children all by themselves is a story of love and perseverance. A story that highlights the need and importance to have a support network comprising their extended family, friends and even enacted policies to make single parenthood work for them. Recently, a single father wrote to me to share about his experience about raising his two young children. While he works hard to put bread on the table for his young family and to provide for his aged parents, he found out that the taxman does not really recognise his role and effort as a single father.While the role and responsibility of being a single parent are not any lesser for a single father, the taxman does not treat a male taxpayer in the same light as the opposite gender when it comes to claiming for Foreign Maid Levy (FML) Relief. While this single father can work out the apportionment of the Qualifying Child Relief with his ex-spouse, there is no levy relief for him if he hires a foreign domestic helper to look after his young children. This single father would fit the criteria for FML relief to the letter, except for the fact that he is of the wrong gender.Anyone in his shoes would certainly use whatever that is out there to stretch his hard earned dollar to feed his family. I hope the Ministry can look into addressing this disparity soon. The Foreign Maid Levy Relief has to be gender neutral.Government Procurement PoliciesMs Foo Mee Har: Chairman Sir, the Public Accounts Committee observed, in its latest report to Parliament, that it is concerned about recurring lapses in procurement and contract management. Government agencies were directed to urgently address these recurring lapses and basic mistakes. They need to prevent weaknesses from compounding over time, and thus weakening governance and accountability for usage of public funds and resources.I would like to ask the Minister how can Government procurement policies and processes be made more streamlined and effective, so that the value of spend is maximised? What training do Government procurement officials undergo, in order to ensure that they are fully conversant with the relevant policies and processes? What consequences do the officers-in-charge and management face, for lapses in enforcing controls? How can the identified lapses be addressed at a whole-of-Government level?The Chairman: Mr Henry Kwek, you may take both your cuts together.Better Support for SMEs and Start-upsMr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon): Mr Chairman, Sir, the Singapore Government is at the forefront of public policy formulation and implementation. It is also one of the largest procurer of goods and services.Naturally, it constitutes an important demonstration platform and springboards for many companies, especially for SMEs and startups, that want to deliver innovative solutions for Singapore and beyond. This is especially so for smart city, climate change, and e-services. Can MOF share how we can enhance the Government procurement approach to enable SMEs and start-ups to develop innovative solutions, and in doing so also help them to grow? This is especially so, as it is imperative to grow new companies in Singapore for the next phase of our economic development. Can MOF also share on how we will inform companies of such efforts? My second cut.Co-creating Solutions with BusinessesAs the needs of our society grow more diverse and complex, it is inevitable that more regulations are needed to safeguard Singaporeans in different ways. At the same time, more regulations mean more processes and greater compliancecost. This represents addedcost and potentially, lost productivity to businesses. I have spoken on this issue on a number of occasions in the past.I am heartened that over the years, the Government also recognises this issue. It has formed the Pro-Enterprise Committee and achieved positive results in cutting red-tape. Nevertheless, this is a never-ending marathon. Can MOF share on how, as part of the Singapore Together movement, MOF and the greater, larger Government agencies can partner businesses on co-creating solutions to reduce compliancecosts and streamline processes for greater productivity?The Chairman: Mr Saktiandi, you may take both cuts together.Transforming Public Service ProcessesMr Saktiandi Supaat: Mr Chairman, the COVID-19 situation we are facing now has highlighted the importance of digitalisation for work and daily household processes. Being able to perform many tasks from home has helped to reduce the necessity of gathering and queuing in public places. In regular times, digitalisation of existing Public Service processes has brought extensive convenience to citizens and businesses.Checking our CPF balances, obtaining information about housing grants, submitting a tender for a public project and so forth have become so easy they can be done from our computers and smartphones. How has MOF tapped on digitalisation to enhance its service delivery and interactions with businesses and citizens? How does it engage the older generation who may experience a steep learning curve and may need the necessary devices to benefit from this digitalisation? Second cut.Deliver Business- and Citizen-centric ServicesMr Saktiandi Supaat: During COVID-19, we saw many heart-warming instances of individuals, organisations and businesses performing acts of kindness, from individuals setting up hand sanitisers for their communities, to businesses giving away masks and organisations persevering with their regular food distributions. Singaporeans also donated generously to organisations in need. It is a reminder of how much we can achieve together.As part of the Singapore Together movement, how has MOF increased partnership and co-creation with citizens, businesses and the community in delivering solutions? How can the Government work together with Singaporeans, stakeholders and partners to ensure that we can inculcate the society and people who have empathy, care and strength to overcome challenges?5.00 pmIncreasing Community and Business PartnersMiss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan): Chairman, Sir, the number of ground-up initiatives supporting the community and underprivileged have increased over the years. In part, it was contributed by greater social awareness, corporate social responsibility and more funding channelled to support these causes. I commend all the immense good efforts and initiatives that everyone across the country have contributed to benefit the different individuals amongst us. I ask that we do not stop here and continue to do more.We have been on the journey of promoting digital services. For a while, the focus had been on our seniors and keeping them abreast of digital application. As we continue to bring more on board this digital journey, I feel that another group of people who will benefit immensely is people with special needs.Under the Singapore Together movement, how can the Ministry enable more partnerships with the community and businesses to co-create, deliver solutions and build a more caring and resilient society?I encourage the community and businesses to use their knowledge, technology, tools and people network to strengthen this partnership in helping people with special needs. I ask we particularly look at some aspects in their life journey.First, life skills for independent living. People’s adaptability to changes vary. For those with special needs, more patience and efforts are even required on their part. To assume responsibility in managing their life, they need more intuitive systems and aid. With big data, there can be analysis done to provide reference for them on how to do certain things or automate it for them.Second, healthcare insurance. Today, people with special needs face insurance discrimination for declaration of their medical conditions. It is not easy for them to get coverage for some basic investment policies, much less medical coverage. By precluding them, they are not just financially worse off but it makes it even harder for them to take stewardship of their health at old age. MediShield Life and soon to be introduced CareShield Life will help but they may not apply for all depending on conditions and further not all their health issues require hospitalisation. Finally, for regular check-ups and therapies, what additional funding and support are available?Third, financial management. Planning is of utmost importance and how to do it becomes critical for people with special needs to learn in order to minimise risk and disruption in their lives. Before investments and housing needs, they could require lessons on financial budgeting around necessities versus good to have. Understanding what is genuinely good for their well-being and prioritise to prevent straining their own resources.Lastly, social life. Moving out of comfort zone in communal setting is not the easiest for many of them. We should try to breakthrough social stigma at workplace, community and family and increasingly integrate them in our society. Build emotional and relational connections with people of special needs and give them a safe and respected environment to be in.The Chairman: Minister Lawrence WongThe Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong): Mr Chairman, I thank the Members for their questions and comments for the Ministry of Finance. Members’ cuts cover three broad topics: first, fiscal sustainability and accountability; second, transformation of public service processes; and third, enhancing service delivery to be more business- and citizen-centric. I will speak on the first topic, as well as the questions on reserves and tax matters. Second Minister for Finance Indranee will cover the other two topics.The COVID-19 virus outbreak and its economic fallout is a timely reminder of why it is critical to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. We are a small country with no natural resources, exposed to global forces beyond our control. As Mr Liang Eng Hwa highlighted just now, our prudent fiscal strategy has provided us with the resources to respond promptly and decisively to crises, and also to continue investing for the future and for the long term.Such resources did not come about overnight. They were built up over several decades. They were the result of prudent fiscal policies put in place by our pioneering leaders. So, it is imperative that we continue to uphold this sound fiscal approach in order to maintain our strong financial position. In particular, as Ms Foo Mee Har mentioned just now and I think Mr Cedric Foo also said earlier in the Budget Debate, every generation must contribute its fair share and not leave an undue burden for the next generation to bear. This is why we must continue to pay for recurrent needs with recurrent revenues. That is why every year when we prepare the Budget, we do not come to Parliament to appropriate monies just for the sake of spending every cent. Instead, we look at each project on its merit, we spend on what we deem to becost-effective, and then if there are any savings, we set these aside for anticipated future needs, as we did this year. We set aside some amount of money for climate change.Upholding such financial prudence and discipline is a reflection of our commitment to Singaporeans, not just the present generation of Singaporeans but, as Deputy Prime Minister said just now in the Budget round-up speech, it is also a reflection of our commitment to future generations of Singaporeans.A key part of our prudent fiscal system is to have a resilient and diverse revenue base, as well as to have effective and value-for-money public spending. So, I will elaborate on each of these.First, on the revenue side. As Ms Foo highlighted, a healthy and growing economy is crucial to sustaining our revenues. This is why the Government invests upstream to build capabilities of Singaporeans and to provide maximum opportunities for Singaporeans to excel. This is how we can continue to enlarge and grow our economic pie.Mr Lee Yi Shyan asked whether Ministries play a role in industry development and contributing to economic growth. In fact, this is already the case. While MTI is the lead agency for the economy, various Government agencies do take on sectoral lead roles. For example, as all of you would know, MAS oversees the financial services sector; the IMDA looks at industry development for the IT sector; and the BCA takes care of the built environment, and so on. All in all, we have 23 Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) and we have set aside budgets for the respective lead agencies to support the implementation of the ITMs and that would include technology adoption, R&D and industry development. All of this work is coordinated under the Future Economy Council.To Ms Foo’s question on the progress of our investments into economic transformation, we are starting to see these efforts bear fruit. In the last three years, overall productivity growth, as measured by real value-added per actual hour worked, rose to 2.6% per year, up from the 2.2% per year in the preceding three-year period. Real median wages have also gone up.Ms Foo also asked about the impact of our R&D investments. The National Research Foundation (NRF) recently completed its mid-term review of the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2020 Plan and this RIE2020 is on track to meeting its outcomes, such as in supporting industry growth and catalysing greater innovative activities in the private sector. As at end March 2019, our RIE investments have supported the creation of more than 5,500 industry jobs. Business Expenditure in R&D has grown steadily since the start of RIE2015, from $4.5 billion in 2011 to $5.6 billion in 2018 – an increase of about 25%. In less than two years, RIE2020 has also exceeded the target of supporting more than 250 successful start-ups.So, we are seeing positive results but there is always room to do better. And all Government agencies are fully aware that they must continue to achieve maximum value from the public funds they are entrusted with, so as to keep transforming our industries and sustaining economic growth.Next, on the expenditure side. Just as we want to grow our revenues, it is equally important to ensure that our spending is prudent, efficient andcost-effective. Ms Foo asked about the budget mechanisms in place to manage expenditure growth and to incentivise public officers to achieve savings.Our Block Budget Framework sets a spending cap for Ministries. In 2017 and 2018, we reduced both the spending cap and the annual growth rate of the block budgets, to further manage expenditure growth. Within this Block Budget Framework, if Ministries have any savings, they can roll over part of the savings from the operating budget to the next financial year.For big-ticket items such as infrastructure and ICT projects, which Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Liang spoke about, MOF applies additional scrutiny to evaluate such projects for their worthiness andcost-effectiveness before embarking on them. Large infrastructure projects, like the coastal protection infrastructure that Mr Saktiandi mentioned, would be reviewed by a panel of technical experts from the private and public sector and academia, before they are given the go-ahead. Over the past five years, these processes have led to design improvements and generated savings of about $3.5 billion for infrastructure projects.Take the Cross Island Line (CRL), for example. The depot for CRL at Changi East was initially planned to be underground to optimise above-ground land use. After working with LTA and agencies to evaluate thecosts and benefits of this approach, agencies found a way to site the depot above ground with reduced engineering risks and at lowercost.Similarly, through the review processes for ICT projects, we have been able to achievecost savings of about 6% or $900 million over the past five years. To further strengthen our scrutiny over ICT spending, we will be inviting industry experts to form an ICT advisory panel to benefit from their private sector perspectives in the evaluation of major Government ICT projects.For issues that may not fall neatly within a specific agency’s domain or area of responsibility, we agree with Ms Foo and Mr Liang that agencies do need to collaborate to avoid duplication of efforts andcosts. To facilitate this, MOF has set up joint programme budgets for cross-cutting areas, like ICT and Smart Systems, Cybersecurity, and Research, Innovation and Enterprise.For example, the Cybersecurity programme budget was put in place by MOF, Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) and Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) to improve coordination, discipline and prioritisation for the build-up of whole-of-Government cybersecurity programmes. So, this sort of partnership helps the Government to make more informed and robust resourcing decisions as a whole.MOF will continue to identify areas that warrant such multi-Ministry or multi-agency approaches and set aside joint programme budgets, where necessary, to get agencies to work together for more effective outcomes, rather than to do so in their individual agency silos.Ultimately, while budgeting mechanisms can facilitate discipline in the way we use public monies, the best way to ensure prudence and effectiveness is to instil a value-for-money (VFM) mindset in every public officer, as Ms Foo and Mr Liang rightly highlighted. Again this is a continual work in progress, but we have seen improvements over the years.Take MOT as an example. It sets outcome-based KPIs such as percentage of commuters' journeys completed within 45 minutes. So, there are clear outcomes for its spending. MOT also conducts VFM workshops for its officers to share ideas and best practices, and has its very own Ministry’s VFM Awards for projects that generate significant dollar savings and benefits for citizens.One LTA project that recently won the MOT VFM Distinguished Award is the Smart and Energy-Efficient Street Lighting System which provides higher energy efficiency, as well as reduced manpower and time to detect and rectify defects. This led tocost savings of about $4 million every year.A key part of ensuring every dollar has been well spent is tracking and evaluating the effectiveness of our spending and we do so by setting KPIs upfront during policy design so that spending is tied to the desired outcomes. Then, we review the policies regularly to ensure that they are on track to fulfil the outcomes.Take the KidSTART programme as an example. ECDA started this as a pilot in 2016 targeting to benefit about 1,000 children, with carefully designed indicators and a clear evaluation plan. Since then, the team has been monitoring outcomes such as child developmental milestones, pre-school attendance and quality of parent-child interactions, to assess the programme's effectiveness. Based on the preliminary results and positive feedback, the Government and MOF had the confidence to expand KidSTART to benefit another 5,000 children over the next three years. And thereafter we will take stock again to see how we can expand KidSTART further. So, this example illustrates the approach we take, how we scale up progressively, relying on data, evidence and learning points to improve the programme, and then, constantly review the effectiveness of public spending.5.15 pmMr Liang earlier shared about his work as a Member of the Public Accounts Committee. Let me thank him and the Public Accounts Committee for their hard work in scrutinising public expenditure.Addressing lapses that Mr Liang and Ms Foo mentioned is a continuing effort that requires balance between controls and efficiency. Like any large organisation, we recognise that it will not be possible to achieve zero lapses, given the high volume of transactions across the Government. Nevertheless, where lapses are found, our agencies will take immediate steps to address them and strengthen their controls to minimise recurrence. This may include relooking at our policies, practices and systems, as well as stepping up training of public officers.I assure Ms Foo that the Government adopts a zero-tolerance approach to fraud and corruption. Those who commit wrongdoing will face the full measure of the law. Where appropriate, disciplinary actions are also brought against officers responsible for lapses. MOF will spare no effort, as we work with agencies to ensure that the Government remains responsible, open and accountable in our use of public funds. We will continue to strengthen our system of checks and balances and instil discipline in every officer to make sound spending decisions.Next, Mr Leon Perera asked about succession plans and disclosure practices of Sovereign Wealth Funds, particularly of GIC and Temasek. The Government has explained its position clearly on these issues. Both GIC and Temasek are commercially-run entities, and the Government maintains an arm's-length relationship with them. The boards of these entities are ultimately responsible for their respective operations, performances as well as succession for leadership.For these two entities, the focus and the mandate that we have put on them is to generate long-term financial returns for the benefit of Singaporeans. The two entities put out a lot of information every year in their annual reports, highlighting not just their performance, but also extensive information and commentary on their investment approach and their outlook. In fact, over the years, GIC and Temasek have progressively put out a lot more information than they used to.We will continue to encourage the two entities to review and examine what additional information they would like to put out in their annual reports. From the Government's point of view, our key consideration is this: whatever disclosure requirements that the two entities put out should be part of an overall system that enables these two entities to maximise their ability to secure long-term returns for the benefit of Singaporeans. That is our overall objective.We want to have a system that allows our two entities to succeed in achieving their mandate and we have to be very mindful of what kind of disclosure requirements we place on them, and be careful of not leading them to pursue indicators that can lead to undesirable behaviours. For example, if we were to insist, as some have suggested before, on publishing annual indicators of performance, some of these entities may then be driven towards short-term performance. That would not be in our interest because these are entities that are looking at achieving long-term financial returns.If we are insistent on them disclosing indicators of fees and expenses to a great level of detail, it may lead these entities towards minimising expenses, potentially eroding capabilities or diminishing their talent pool, which would also not be in our interest. So, we are quite careful and deliberate in thinking about what sort of system we want to put in place and ultimately, it is a system that enhances the performance of the two entities in securing long-term returns.That is why if you look at what is published, it is the long-term returns net of all expenses incurred, and the information is published for both GIC and Temasek in their annual reports. Ultimately, we want to preserve the competitive advantage of our two investment entities vis-a-vis other market players and we want to maximise their ability to secure long-term returns for the benefit of Singaporeans.Lastly, let me touch on tax-related matters. Mr Louis Ng and Mr Png Eng Huat suggested extending existing tax reliefs to unwed parents and single fathers respectively. Again, let me explain the Government's considerations here.Where there are Government benefits that support the child's growth and development, we will extend them, regardless of their parents' marital status. That is why all Singaporean children today receive over $180,000 of education subsidies by the time they turn 16, at least $6,000 in their Child Development Account (CDA) Grants and $4,000 in MediSave Grant for Newborns. In this way, we support all parents, including unwed parents, to give their children education opportunities, good healthcare and a conducive social environment, so they can realise their fullest potential in life.For the Parenthood Tax Rebate and Working Mother's Child Relief, these were intended to support parenthood within marriage and for married mothers to continue working after childbirth. Likewise, for the Foreign Maid Levy Relief, this was specifically granted to encourage married women to continue working. So, there were specific objectives tied to these schemes. Having said that, all Members would know that,our schemes are never cast in stone. We continue to review and re-calibrate them from time to time.Members will recall that we have reviewed and extended support to unwed parents in recent years, including the CDA benefits as well as the full 16 weeks of Government-paid maternity leave. These things will continue to progress and evolve.I would encourage Members also to consider this. Besides looking at specific tax reliefs and comparing the benefits for one group versus another, it is important to take a step back and look at the broader picture. Ultimately, we all share common objectives. We want to give every child a good start in life, provide support for all parents and build strong families in Singapore. We have different schemes and policy tools to achieve these multiple objectives and we will continue to fine-tune and review our schemes to achieve the optimal balance.Mr Chairman, MOF is committed to ensuring that our spending is effective and sustainable over the long term and we will do so in partnership with the community. I will let Second Minister for Finance Indranee address the other questions raised.The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah): Mr Chairman, I will now address Members' questions which fall under two broad topics: first, how the Government is transforming public service processes to better serve our people and, second, how we are enhancing service delivery to be more business- and citizen-centric.Minister Chan spoke earlier about transforming the public service for the future. I will cover MOF's efforts in transforming Government procurement through rule reviews and pervasive use of technology. This contributes to being more nimble, innovative and effective, as urged by Mr Liang and Ms Foo.First, MOF has used regulatory sandboxes to lift procurement rules and allow agencies to test new approaches. One such sandbox enables Government agencies to negotiate with the most qualified bidders in open tenders to identify alternative solutions that provide better value for the Government. For instance, through this approach, we were able to secure a morecost-effective solution for a large ICT contract at tens of millions of dollars lower than the original bid price.Second, we are introducing more dynamism in some of our bulk contracts to be responsive to market changes. While current ICT bulk contracts allow suppliers to refresh their prices, we are introducing further dynamism by allowing new requirements and new suppliers to be added throughout a multi-year contract. This is especially pertinent in an environment of rapid technology changes. Suppliers will be able to offer new products and services to the Government, without waiting for bulk contracts to expire. Agencies can have faster access to newer technology and capabilities, leading to time savings of about three months each time this feature is used. We have piloted the use of dynamic contracts for two ICT bulk tenders amounting to more than $700 million and will scale this up to three more bulk tenders this year.Third, public officers can soon make small value purchases directly from e-commerce sites, which will enhance speed and convenience. Today, the public service spends more than $60 million annually on small value items, such as pantry supplies, stationery and small electrical appliances. By the end of this year, MOF and GovTech will enable public officers to make small value purchases from e-commerce sites seamlessly, without having to claim reimbursement.A fully automated e-commerce model will lighten the processing workload on our corporate staff. Audit controls will be automated and monitoring done in the background. This will save our public officers more than 100,000 man-days a year, freeing up their time to focus on delivering better services to the public.We are partnering our vendors in this digitalisation journey, particularly our SMEs. By bringing their businesses online, SMEs can digitalise their processes from order to invoice to payment and improve productivity. It also opens up new opportunities – SMEs can access an additional channel to supply Government agencies and other buyers and expand their reach beyond Singapore's shores.Mr Henry Kwek asked how we are enhancing the Government procurement approach to enable SMEs and startups to develop innovative solutions and help them grow. More than 80% of the total number of procurement opportunities are awarded to SMEs and startups. We will continue to look at how we can facilitate their participation and support their growth.Mr Kwek also asked how we inform companies of such efforts. One key way is to partner our Trade Associations and Chambers to reach out to them. For instance, MOF regularly engages the Singapore Business Federation to gather feedback from their members and provide clarifications on Government procurement matters.GovTech, as the Government’s lead for ICT procurement, has regular platforms with SGTech to facilitate collaborations with the tech industry. One of the initiatives shared with SGTech is the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)'s Open Innovation Platform (OIP), which enables smaller enterprises to better access Government opportunities.Since its launch in July 2018, agencies have posted 13 challenges on OIP to invite the public to submit solutions, with prize monies of more than half a million dollars. This attracted 191 proposals, with more than 90% coming from SMEs, startups and individuals.NEA, for example, has posted a challenge on addressing air pollution from vehicles' smoke emission. Twenty SMEs, startups and individuals submitted proposals. NEA is now working with the awarded startup to co-develop a proof-of-concept where video analytics capabilities will be used to detect smoke emissions remotely yet accurately. If the solution proves to be effective, it can be piloted and scaled up without the need for further tenders.For the ICT sector, we have gone a step further to list promising Singapore-based tech startups in a panel for Government agencies to consider first. The SG:D Spark programme gives these startups priority access to Government projects to build capabilities and track record for further growth.Impress.ai is a local SME on the SG:D Spark programme which helps companies automate their recruitment process using artificial intelligence. It has grown its clientele to 10 Government agencies in its two years on the programme. These agencies, in turn, have benefited from a more efficient and effective recruitment process. For example, Ngee Ann Polytechnic reduced the time taken to review over 4,000 applications, from 470 hours to just two hours.Mr Saktiandi and Mr Liang asked how MOF has tapped on digitalisation to enhance its interactions with businesses and citizens. Mr Kwek also talked about reducing business compliancecosts.Earlier this year, the Accountant-General’s Department announced that the Government has taken the lead to adopt the Nationwide e-Invoicing Network. This provides our 20,000 vendors currently on e-invoicing arrangements with an additional channel to transmit invoices from their accounting systems to the Government. Being on the network also allows vendors to exchange documents seamlessly with one another, including overseas counterparties.As part of the Digital Government Blueprint, all Government interactions with businesses and citizens will include an electronic signature option by 2023. This will make it easier, more convenient and lesscostly to transact with the Government. Within the Public Service, we have conducted reviews to digitalise processes and do away with signatures. Where signatures are still required, electronic signatures will be the norm.We have gone one step further to integrate digital solutions across platforms and agencies to create seamless digital touchpoints. In partnership with software providers, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) are enabling seamless filing for smaller companies. Using source data from accounting records, financial and tax returns can now be automatically generated and submitted directly to ACRA and IRAS. With the launch later this year, about 200,000 companies can potentially benefit from this initiative.5.30 pmEven as we seek to create seamless digital touch points with citizens, we must also help those who might require more customised assistance, as Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Miss Cheryl Chan highlighted.IRAS has been working with taxi and private hire car (PHC) drivers on a chat-filing initiative to simplify tax filing. Through this collaboration, IRAS developed a conversational-style form to help drivers understand the information they need to report. The form was piloted last year with over 600 drivers who found this tax filing process more intuitive. They also spent 30% less time filing their returns. Given its success, IRAS is working with GovTech on a prototype chatbot to benefit about 6,000 taxi and PHC drivers during this year's tax filing season.We recognise that the Government does not have a monopoly of ideas or resources. For Singapore to succeed, we must harness the collective wisdom and ideas of our people. I am glad that Mr Henry Kwek, Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Miss Cheryl Chan highlighted the SG Together movement, which will anchor our nation-building going forward.Budget 2020 is a good example of SG Together in action. We engaged and received suggestions from about 6,000 contributors, almost 40% more than last year's Budget. We will continue to step up our engagement efforts so that all Singaporeans can have a say in our Budget.Beyond engagement, we seek to actively partner our businesses, community groups and citizens to create policy solutions together. Take for example the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme under Budget 2020. This had its origins in early discussions between the Tsao Foundation and the Government. The Tsao Foundation did a pilot study to provide dollar-matching on CPF savings for a small group of older women. We then scaled up the idea into a nation-wide programme to boost the retirement adequacy of eligible lower and middle income seniors with little retirement savings.We also leveraged data sharing via Application Programming Interface (API) exchanges and crowdsourcing through hackathons to co-create solutions.For instance, IRAS' API Marketplace and ACRA's API Mall allow developers and businesses to harness data and create applications that interface seamlessly with Government systems. These APIs are currently used by over 150 organisations to develop business and productivity solutions.We have also taken a further step to partner businesses and empower the community to co-implement solutions. For example, our banks and telecommunication service providers are valuable partners under IMDA and Enterprise Singapore's Start Digital initiative, who help introduce business solutions through their touch points with SMEs. With their support, the scheme has benefited over 10,000 SMEs since its launch in 2019.We also leveraged partnerships to promote inclusive growth, and foster a caring and resilient society, which Miss Cheryl Chan spoke about. Tote Board's Enabling Lives Initiative, managed by SG Enable and the National Council of Social Service, is one example of how various stakeholders such as social service agencies, academia and corporates work together to deliver projects that improve the well-being of persons with disabilities and care-givers.As Miss Cheryl Chan mentioned, people with special needs will benefit immensely from the use of digital tools. Under Tote Board's initiative, a social enterprise called Digital D.R.E.A.M. pioneered the use of virtual reality systems to provide immersive learning opportunities for students with special needs, such as learning about road safety in a safe environment. Digital D.R.E.A.M. has since partnered various Special Education schools to develop tailored content materials for their students.Later this year, Tote Board will launch the second tranche of the initiative. We look forward to more collaborations with our community partners to deliver impactful and innovative solutions in various aspects such as life skills and assistive technology for persons with disabilities.MSF has formed three Enabling Masterplan work groups to guide us in building a more inclusive society. More details will be shared at MSF'sCOSlater.Mr Chairman, our work is not done in creating a better Singapore for all. We encourage our businesses, community groups and individuals to come forward and work together with us to build and sustain Singapore's success for future generations.The Chairman: Mr Louis Ng.Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: Thank you, Sir, just three points regarding the single unweds again. We have MND that is saying that every mother and every father is equal. It does not really matter whether the child was born out of marriage. But here we are now saying that they are not equal, that because the child was born outside of marriage, they will not qualify for the Parenthood Tax Rebate and the Working Mother's Child Relief. Why do we do that?Second, with these two rebate and relief, there are single parents who qualify for it, who are the divorcees. So, why can we not just extend it to the single unweds? Unless of course we are saying we want that as a form of deterrent so that people do not have children out of wedlock. But again, as I raised in my Adjournment Motion, I doubt this will be a deterrence, unless, just before they have sex, they think about the Parenthood Tax Rebate and Working Mother's Child Relief, which we know, will not happen.And that comes to my third point. I am not really fighting for a lot of money here and I do not think actually a lot of single unweds pay a lot of taxes, because we know their median income is $600 for those under 35. We are not fighting for the money here. We are fighting the stigma and the discrimination. And I know MOF will support this as this is a Unity Budget. It should be for all Singaporeans.Mr Lawrence Wong: Mr Chairman, I think Mr Louis Ng is talking about the support for single unwed parents in the context of MND's issues on housing; and certainly, if I were to wear my MND hat, we have said that we want to provide housing even for single unwed parents in the interest of the child. So, there is no issue there.But I think the question here is a different one. I think the question here is: do we want to provide support for parenthood in the context of marriage? Singaporeans have asked for this support. Various Members of the House have asked for such support too. And if you were to provide that support, there will invariably be a gradient between incentives and encouragement for parenthood within the context of marriage versus outside of marriage. That gradient exists today in our schemes.But it does not mean that we are not supporting children. As I said, schemes that provide support for children, we will ensure that the children have them. It does not mean that we are not supporting parents, whether you are a single father, a single mother or whether you are a divorcee. We have support for them. But so long as we take the view that we want to provide support for parenthood in the context of marriage, that gradient will exist.How do we manage this going forward? Do we still want a gradient? Do we not want the gradient and treat all as equal? I think that will evolve. It is a continuing journey, as I alluded to earlier. I think in this House, we have heard calls for more support for parenthood in the context of marriage too. So, obviously, there are different views and we will have to manage these different views and continue to refine and improve our schemes over time to manage this diversity of views and to address the different objectives, as I highlighted earlier.Mr Liang Eng Hwa: Sir, I noticed in the revenue estimates that the NIRC has grown from $17 billion last year to $18.6 billion for FY2020. So, can I ask the Minister if this continued growth in NIRC is realistic, sustainable, given the grimmer outlook now, not just because of the current COVID-19 fallout but also of more concern are the longer term global structural stresses that we saw and the persistent near-zero interest rate environment that is still there? Can we expect this NIRC to grow to fund our Budget in the future?Mr Lawrence Wong: Mr Chairman, the NIRC will be an important source of revenue over the long term. As Mr Liang Eng Hwa, I think, is fully aware, the NIRC is tied to the long-term expected returns of our investment entities. So, the critical words are \"long-term expected returns\". It is not linked to short-term performance. It is not impacted by immediate market volatilities. So, we are not so concerned about that.But looking ahead, looking at the long term, there are indeed reasons for concerns. And we do expect more pressures in the longer term investment environment. For example, geopolitical tensions, I think, will be a long-term issue between America and China. That contestation for power will be with us for quite awhile and it may lead to a more bifurcated world over a period of time.We will likely see more nationalist and protectionist pressures continuing, which means that the pace of globalisation will slow. We may even get de-globalisation, which will cause global growth to be lower for longer periods of time.In developed markets, you see ageing populations, you see lower productivity, you see stagnating growth. So, those trends are continuing.If you think about these long-term trends, then indeed, there will be continued pressures on our long-term expected returns. So, we are very mindful of that. We stay vigilant. We do not assume that our NIRC will always be able to keep pace with our spending needs and that is why all the more we must not take our current fiscal strength for granted.The Chairman: Okay, Mr Louis Ng, one more time. Last one.Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: I try one more time, Sir. I hope the Minister will agree with me that it is not a deterrence. Not providing single unweds with the Parenthood Tax Rebate and Working Mother's Child Relief is not a deterrence. And I also hope that the Minister will agree with me that it is not an incentive. It might be this worry that if we provide the single unweds with more benefits, all of a sudden, there is going to be huge population of children born out of wedlock. I do not think that will happen as well. And if we do not think that it is going to incentivise or discourage, then again, what is stopping us from levelling this playing field and ending the discrimination?Mr Lawrence Wong: Mr Chairman, I respect Mr Ng's views. I think there are many in this House who will feel like that. I think there are many who will also ask for additional support for parenthood in the context of marriage as has been the case before. So like I said, there will be a range of perspectives on this matter. We take all this into consideration in continuing to review and update our schemes.Ms Foo Mee Har: I actually would like to continue the clarification started by Member Liang Eng Hwa and the Minister's eloquent reply. It is regarding the return from NIRC.I noted the same strong growth projected for 2020. It is 9.3%. And I do understand we project long-term expected returns. To me, that is a very big achievement and we are very grateful, because we can then use it to fund our Budget. But then, what would the trend be in terms of percentage increases? 9.3%, right? This year versus last year. I think in wealth management, if you can achieve 9.3% for long-term expected growth, that would be an amazing achievement. I would like to ask the Minister whether there was some special adjustment from 2020 versus 2019, because I would imagine for the long term, probably, it would look more like 4%. That would be a good achievement.Mr Lawrence Wong: Mr Chairman, there are two figures which we should not conflate. One is the growth of NIRC but that does not equate to the long-term expected rate of return, because the NIRC is the base multiplied by the rate of return. So, the base changes too, in order to get your NIRC.As far as the rate of return is concerned, this is evaluated every year. We have a rigorous process to go through what that rate of return should be. The investment entities will review it. MOF will review it as well, and then we put it up to the Council of Presidential Advisers and the President finally has to approve the figures. We have explained the process, it is a rigorous process that goes through quite a bit of scrutiny before we finalise the figure.The trends which I talked about earlier, what Mr Liang Eng Hwa had asked for, are concerns that we have, looking ahead. It need not impact on the immediate long-term expected rate of return. But we are concerned indeed that over a period of time, if these trends were to continue, if you see continued geopolitical tensions, if you see a growing trend of de-globalisation, then indeed, expected returns over the longer term may be impacted. So, we are mindful and we are watchful over this.The Chairman: Mr Pritam Singh.5.45 pmMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Mr Chairman, I did not file a cut for this Head, but if there are questions, I am prepared to give way. I am assuming that there is no one behind me who has raised his or her hand. If it is fine, I will just proceed to ask my question.The Chairman: What are you requesting, Mr Singh?Mr Pritam Singh: I am going to ask a question but I did not speak during for this Head, Mr Chairman, so I feel that those who had filed cuts should have first priority.The Chairman: If you can couch it as a clarification, I will allow it. If it is a new question, I will not allow it.Mr Pritam Singh: Sure. I will put the clarification. Minister Wong, following up on the question on the NIRC, I remember when we had the debate in this House in July 2015 on the amendment to the Constitution. We confirmed that the formula that was derived – the figures the NIRC reflects – is very conservative. Even more so when the broader economic environment is poor. It could be structurally or cyclically poor. Can I confirm then that the prospects of a \"famine and feast\" of NIRC, as a budget line item, actually is very, very minimal. That is the first clarification.The second clarification is pertaining to the question I had put in my Budget speech about the formula that the Government was proceeding with insofar debt financing was concerned and the implications that has on some sort of fiscal room in subsequent budgets. Is there any clarity on that particular point, because the repayment period is stretched instead of a lumpy one-time or two-time payments. Thank you for the indulgence, Mr Chairman.Mr Lawrence Wong: Technically, the second question is a new question not a clarification, but I will answer it anyway.On the first part, the NIRC or the long-term expected return is looking at long-term what the investment entities are expecting in terms of their returns over a long period of time. So, it is not tied to immediate short-term market performance.For example, if this year's market performance ends up negative, stock markets everywhere were to crash and overall returns are negative, it does not impact on our NIRC. Conversely, if it is a bonanza year and markets were to go up, it does not impact on our NIRC because we are looking at expected long-term returns. So, to the first point, it is not so much a conservative element. It is simply that we look at a long-term figure in order to derive the NIRC. We do not look at short-term market changes. So, that is our focus for deriving the NIRC. And that is also why we have continually emphasised that we hold our investment entities to the performance measure of their long-term returns, rather than looking at year-to-year performance. Because year-to-year performance can vary depending on the market, but we look at long-term trends.On the second part, we are still working out the debt financing arrangement. MOF will reveal the details of the debt financing arrangement in due course. The idea is that we will borrow for selected major infrastructure. Rather than to fund this entirely from the Budget, we will do it through borrowing. We think this is a more equitable arrangement for major infrastructure that spans a long period of time; then, both current and future generations will pay for the payment of that infrastructure through its useful life. Doing so may provide you some fiscal space in the interim, of course, compared to the alternative of funding everything upfront. But I think it would also be wrong to assume that this fiscal space can be entirely spent away because you need to pay for it later on anyway. If you were to spend all of that fiscal space immediately on something that carries a long tail, down the road, you will end up with difficulties paying for the debt repayment.So, the idea of borrowing is, not so much to provide fiscal space. It is really one where we look at the infrastructure spending we will need to incur going forward, it is likely to be another lump that is coming up in terms of infrastructure needs, like we did when we first financed our first MRT project. We borrowed for it as well. So, now, in the new phase of development, there will be major infrastructure projects coming up. We think it is more equitable that the Government borrow and then spread out the repayment over the lifespan of the project rather than to fund everything upfront, which I think would then present too much of a burden on the current generation. That is the thinking around debt financing. It is not so much to provide fiscal relief or fiscal space.The Chairman: Mr Liang, would you like to withdraw your amendment?Mr Liang Eng Hwa: Sir, on behalf of the Members of this House, I would like to thank Deputy Prime Minister and the Finance Minister for a massive and far-reaching Budget, if befitting of the challenging environment that we are in today. He has not only shown fiscal fire power but also standing power – speaking and standing for more than two hours in both speeches.I also want to thank Minister Wong and Minister Indranee for responding to our cuts and also the various engagements that we have with the GPC.And finally, to the MOF colleagues, they must have worked really hard this time with the fluid circumstances. I hope the young officers can now make up for their Valentine's Day that they missed out as the Deputy Prime Minister has mentioned. With that, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $877,537,300 for Head M ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $158,428,400 for Head M ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates."

        "Content": "Partnering for DigitalisationMr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer): Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head Q of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".Digitalisation is transforming how people live, work, play and interact. Business enterprises must embrace it to remain relevant. Our future is being shaped by digitalisation in ways unimaginable and at a pace unprecedented.As a result of the digital economy, many of our top companies in the world are now in the technology space. By market capitalisation, seven out of top 10 companies worldwide are technology companies. Combined, these seven companies are worth about US$6 trillion.It is clear that our Government, businesses and workers must look to digitalisation to transform our economy, create opportunities and move up the value chain. That way, we stay relevant and create good and enduring jobs. If done well, we can turn our vulnerabilities into opportunities. Traditional factors of production like land, labour, capital, or even our ageing population are no longer hard constraints in the digital economy and if we play our cards right, we can be successful.However, digitalisation does bring about many challenges, especially for a city-state with a small population and a consumer base.Data analytics, machine learning and AI require massive amounts of data. For our Government and local enterprises alike, it would be challenging to acquire a large enough volume of data compared to other larger countries. How we overcome this constraint would make a big difference in our digitalisation success. Perhaps, digital trade agreements, like the ones we just concluded with New Zealand and Chile, could be helpful. If there are more such agreements, with a framework for sharing aggregate anonymised data, for mutual recognition or for inter-operability, it would be beneficial to Singapore as well as all participating economies. Could the Minister elaborate on this?Even as data are shared with our local business enterprises, we would need to consider issues like personal data privacy and therefore the principles upon which data requests by private enterprises can be agreed to or not by the Government. This is an issue that needs clarity and could the Minister also inform us of what these principles are?Digital talent alone is not sufficient for innovation. Often, design thinking and deep insights into specific industry are also needed for successful innovations and commercialisation. MCI has a Design Thinking Unit. How would the Ministry increase this Unit's impact for innovation and commercialisation in Singapore?Just as we set boundaries in the area of Bio-ethics, we would similarly need to set up an ethical framework, within which, AI can operate here in Singapore. Can the Minister advise us on the work around this area as well?One of the key success factors for digitalisation is scale and capacity. Unfortunately, this is a challenge for many of our SMEs. How would MCI induct and incentivise such SMEs to take on digitalisation for a brighter future for themselves?There is also a pressing need as we become more digital as a nation to enhance our cybersecurity. I will address this issue under a different cut later.Foreign Digital TalentChairman, my next cut is on foreign digital talent, as an interim measure, to augment Singaporeans as Singapore embarks on digitalisation. We hear a clarion call from the industry that there is a dearth of digital talent in data science and cybersecurity, in computer science and so forth. And as we transform our economy, such talents would be in very high demand.GovTech actively recruits talents in the Technology Industry to turn our Smart Nation vision into a reality. On the other hand, due to scarcity of such talent, GovTech would be competing with the private sector for similar talents.How would we strike the right balance here, such that we create a symbiotic relationship between the private and public sector instead of creating a \"win-lose\" situation amounting to a \"zero sum\" game?Can the Minister advise the number of Computer Science and Data Science graduates in our local Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs)? What are the projections for such graduates in the next five to 10 years? If the number of graduates are insufficient to meet industry demand, could the Government allow for employment and S Passes to be issued as an interim measure? That way, we can attract more investments into Singapore now which will eventually benefit future Singapore graduates in such fields. The alternative is to risk such investments going elsewhere.Question proposed.Digital Opportunities for BusinessesMs Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong): Most, if not all, companies in Singapore would agree that digital transformation is no longer an option, but a necessary step if they are to survive. Over the years, the Government has been urging companies, including small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to transform and adopt appropriate technology to stay relevant and competitive. This message appears to have sunk in and there is keen awareness of the need to go digital.However, awareness may not necessarily translate to action as a number of companies, especially the smaller businesses, have been slow to make the transition. Minister Iswaran at MCI's workplan seminar last year said that it is not about a lack of awareness or will on SMEs’ parts anymore but more about them being resource-constrained and lacking capacity to get the transformation done.Similar observations were also made by the Chief Executive Officer of Singapore Business Federation (SBF), Mr Ho Meng Kit in a commentary last year. He mentioned that business transformation is hindered by talent deficit in Singapore's tech sector andcost or perceivedcost of adopting digital solutions. In the commentary, Mr Ho, gave several suggestions to businesses to tackle the tech gap, for example by leveraging on IMDA’s SMEs Go Digital Programme.Earlier this year, SBF also released its National Business Survey 2019/2020, which found that SMEs know that they need to adopt digital solutions to tackle their top challenges of manpowercosts and finding new and better ways to generate revenue, butcosts remain the biggest roadblock. SBF called on the Government to build on the momentum with robust measures that encourage, support and strengthen the digitalisation and research and development efforts of companies.In reviewing the developments over the years, what is the assessment on the effectiveness of our initiatives in digitalising companies? Are we better able to appreciate the specific challenges faced by SMEs and address them? How do we intend to continue helping companies access opportunities and scale in the Digital Economy?The Chairman: Mr Ong Teng Koon, take both cuts.Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee): Both cuts, thank you. Mr Chairman, the SME Go Digital Programme has helped over 4,000 companies to implement digital solutions. This is encouraging to hear and it should remain our priority to accelerate digital transformation in order to create new opportunities, both locally and in the region. I would like to ask the Minister what are our future plans for the Go Digital Programme and how we intend to continue to drive digital adoption in SMEs?For a SME to go digital, talent is paramount.\tHowever, the competition for talents in fields such as automation and machine learning is fierce. Our SMEs may be no match for MNCs when it comes to recruitment. I would like to ask the Minster how we can ensure that our SMEs are able to attract the talent they need and how can we help SMEs to develop such skills in-house by upskilling their existing employees.One of the key challenges to any digitalisation faced by SMEs is getting all their employees ready and equipped for these changes. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. I would like to ask the Minister if he would consider additional skill training subsidies for all the employees of SMEs to complement their ongoing digital transformation.Helping Singaporeans Get Good JobsMy next cut. The Infocomm Media (ICM) sector is a key growth sector, particularly in technology such as cybersecurity, Internet of Things, immersive media, data analytics and artificial intelligence. I would like to ask the Minister how many jobs would be created for Singaporeans in such sector and how we can help mature PMETs who are displaced from adjacent industries to get employed into the ICM sector. And would the Minster consider a stipend for mature PMETs who undergo retraining so that they are able to still take care of their families while they are doing so?In relation to cybersecurity jobs, as advertised by the Professional Conversion Programme on WSG's website, residents have given me feedback that it is difficult to get a place into such professional conversion programmes. This issue is these programmes on a place-and-train basis. Place-and-train means that they need to get a job first before they can get training. These residents are stuck in a catch-22 situation. They need to get the job first before they can get training but they need the training to get the job. So, I would like to ask the Minister whether he can consider to go beyond what Deputy Prime Minister announced in his Budget Statement of the 20% salary support for six months, to further incentivise companies to take the first step.The creation of jobs for Singapore in the ICM sector is contingent on Singapore being an attractive hub to local and global businesses. I would like to ask the Minster what are plans to further develop our local eco-system and how do we continue to position Singapore as the digital technological hub for Asia. And how do we ensure that research, innovation and entrepreneurship continue to be our engines of growth?Mr Chairman: Ms Tin Pei Ling, both cuts, please.11.45 amTech Talents In and For SingaporeMs Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson): Talents are critical in building new and successful industries. We need a high concentration of skilled workers with a critical mass of world class talents to attract top enterprises and future unicorns to Singapore to create good jobs, and we need to develop Singaporeans to excel in these jobs. As talents beget talents, there is a virtuous cycle to this.On 6 January this year, the Minister informed the House that more than 93,000 training places have been taken up or committed since the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) programme started in 2016. And as of October 2019, 1,400 trainees completed the Tech Immersion and Placement Programme (TIPP). These are impressive numbers.May I ask the Ministry if we are on track in meeting the ICT industry manpower demand? Of the 93,000 TeSA places, how many have completed the programme, successfully found placement and stayed in the new jobs? What other efforts are in place to help Singaporeans switch careers and stay meaningfully employed in the digital economy? How can enterprises that are less tech-savvy but keen to transform, better access and tap into this pool of re-skilled and up-skilled workers?As Singapore continues on our relentless pursuit to re-skill and up-skill our Singaporean core, it can be expected that enterprises will look to topping up their teams with overseas talents to plug the talent and skills gap in the meantime.Global competition for skilled workers is stiff. In a February 2020 McKinsey's article, it was reported that 87% of companies surveyed around the world say they are either experiencing manpower gaps now or expect to experience it within a few years. Respondents expect market and technology trends to play a big part in these shifts.More dramatically, the World Economic Forum describes the world as facing a \"re-skilling emergency\". One billion people globally need to be re-skilled by 2030.Companies and countries are motivated to close the skills gap fast. Singapore needs to be even faster – one to two years' window of opportunity, according to some prominent business leaders in the ICT industry I encountered from within and outside of Singapore. Unresolved US-China tensions and rising protectionism around the world resulted in talent displacement. Amongst these talents, there is a group who not only have deep skills, but also an international perspective given their exposures. If we are able to tap on this group of talents and pick the \"winners\" for Singapore before others do, Singapore's transformation could be catalysed and more top enterprises with good jobs for our people will be attracted to Singapore.Therefore, I would like to ask what role is the Government playing in attracting talents to Singapore, for Singapore, as we strive towards our future economy? Ultimately, our Singaporean Core must benefit from this exercise and so, how could we ensure skills and knowledge transfer?Some of these talents are founders of fast-rising start-ups or fast-growing firms. They are therefore globally mobile by nature. Still, they can invest in Singapore and have a role to play in helping to develop our workforce. Might the Government be exploring ways to harness the value they can offer to Singapore, and help groom our youth and talents, without requiring them to physically anchor here?Data Infrastructure for Digital FutureSingapore is on track to fulfill our smart nation aspiration and is positioned to become a leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain. Data is critical in enabling this. Big data fuels AI and AI will drive many daily applications in our digital future. Therefore, the quality and integrity of data is important. Having data that can readily be shared or used from one system to another is also important.As ASEAN integrates and transforms, and as Singapore champions the effort to build and strengthen the ASEAN Smart Cities Network, how do we ensure that the data generated are meaningful, of good quality and inter-operable across the region? What role can Singapore play in influencing and setting standards for the data and the digital infrastructure necessary for a smart ASEAN?This development will see an \"explosion\" of data and the need for high speed processing. Data centres are therefore a critical infrastructure for Singapore. It is the backbone of our future economy. How many data centres do we expect to be built and at what pace in order to achieve our smart nation and smart ASEAN aims?Building data centres comes at acost. It consumes a lot of energy. Data centers today consume about 2% of electricity worldwide. It also has massive carbon footprint. Data centres worldwide generate 0.3% of carbon footprint today and is set to increase.So, what is the Government doing to promote greater efficiencies and mitigate the carbon footprints as we build more data centres? How do we reconcile this expected increase in energy consumption and carbon footprints while achieving our target of halving carbon emissions by 2030 and zero by 2050?Ethical Issues on the Use of DataMr Ong Teng Koon: Mr Chairman, data can be used for great good or it can be used to inflict terrible harm. With developments in technology ranging from facial recognition to online personality analysis, individual data is increasingly easy to obtain.We have the Personal Data Protection Act to protect individual privacy but there are also data portability concerns. We need to address the issue of secondary acquisition of data and the use of legally acquired data by undesirable companies. For example, a foreign online company might acquire and transfer the personal data from a local company. These foreign online betting companies then target the vulnerable and entice them to gamble. How can the Minister ensure that data portability and data protection can work together without conflict?I would also like to ask the Minister how we can use legislation to restrict the data that companies collect. What users often encounter on websites or when downloading apps on their smartphones are these lengthy click-through agreements with a lot of information disclosure provisions embedded in those agreements. The result is that when the users click \"accept\", they are allowing these information disclosure terms which expose them to the sharing of data and often without their knowledge. So, I would like to ask the Minister what ethical safeguards can be put in place to protect the consumer and Singaporeans at large.PDPA–Jobs for Para-professionalsMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast): Under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012, it is mandatory for every organisation to designate one or more individuals as data protection officers. These individuals are tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that the organisation complies with the Act.Increasingly, companies and organisations have also realised that the job responsibilities of a data protection officer are often executive and managerial in nature, requiring the development and implementation of policies and processes. All this should translate to more job openings for data protection officers which would be suitable for PMETs looking into making this mid-career switch or to be re-deployed in their existing organisations. Can MCI share how many new roles and job openings this will possibly create for Singaporeans?Notwithstanding, to facilitate the successful hiring, placement and re-deployment of PMETs in the data protection field, there is a need to take more active steps to train, place, match and re-deploy suitable PMETs to potential employers, or even data protection and compliance roles within their existing organisations. I look forward to seeing more employers collaborate with placement agencies such as e2i to help more PMET mid-career switchers, whether entering into the industry or being retained to be re-deployed within the organisation, transition into their new role as data protection professionals.I applaud the Data Protection Officers (DPO) Competency Framework and Training Roadmap which was published by the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) on 17 July 2019. It was developed to guide data protection professionals in enhancing their competencies. It also provides guidance on the viable career pathways for different levels of DPOs. I hope to hear MCI's plans on what and how we can do more to make this area of expertise an attractive and viable option for mid-career PMETs.Regulating Facial Recognition TechnologyMr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang): Chairman, we have seen an increase in the application of facial recognition technologies being employed in Singapore. Even this House is contemplating the use of this technology to track Members' attendance. I saw that in the tender. While this technology started out mainly to tackle security, are there any guidelines for the use of facial recognition technology to ensure data is not misused for commercial purposes and that its use does not compromise personal data security?Sir, I believe there is a need for greater regulation of the deployment of facial recognition technology. Currently, several buildings such as UOB Plaza and SGX Centre already use such technology.The use of facial recognition for building access would link the name of the visitor to the facial recognition data. Does facial recognition data then become part of the intellectual property of the technology vendor? How long can the vendor keep such information? Can the vendor use the same information for its other customers?The other aspect is whether the vendor is allowed to link facial recognition pattern to even more data such as consumer buying behaviour. The possible abuse of such technology is mind-boggling if we do not have guidelines on its use.Chairman, may I propose that all facial recognition data collected by private commercial entities should not be stored for more than 24 hours. Other than name, facial recognition data should not be linked to any other information such as consumer buying pattern. Where exceptions are needed, express consent should be obtained and even then, there should always be a maximum time limit for which facial recognition data can be stored.Chairman, it is a brave new world that we live in and I am worried that without guidelines, there will be misuse of facial recognition technology and data. So, I really hope that MCI can look into this issue.The Chairman: Mr Mohamed Irshad, take both your cuts, please.The Future of Post and ParcelMr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member): Chairman, globally, the post and parcel industry is undoubtedly being disrupted. With ever-changing returns in core mail business, the rapid take up of e-commerce and shifting customer expectations, post and parcel companies of today need to be adaptable, they need to be relevant and to be innovative to keep pace with changing demands.Sir, the rise in e-commerce and online shopping has indelibly altered consumer behaviour. Many consumers have also increased expectations about the convenience and options offered by deliveries and postal infrastructure. Today, there are only several logistics service providers that offer last-mile delivery services besides SingPost.In this regard, what are the Government's plans to transform our domestic postal infrastructure to meet these new demands, ensuring world class delivery standards? Importantly, what can consumers and businesses look forward to in the future and how will these changes be integrated with the current postal infrastructure in Singapore?5G Roll-out in SingaporeMr Chairman, I turn to speak about 5G – 5G is the basis for digital connectivity and will be the backbone for our digital future. It will enable possible new areas of growth in autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things in industry and in consumer segments.In June 2019, the Minister for Communications and Information, Mr S Iswaran, announced that the Government has set aside $40 million to develop the 5G research and innovation eco-system, specifically to support 5G technology trials, open test beds and enable research and development in 5G. What is the progress on Singapore's efforts to develop the 5G research and innovation eco-system?Also, given IMDA's 5G Call For Proposal, what are our plans for 5G deployment? What is the Government doing to support the rollout of 5G to ensure that Singapore remains competitive on the international front? Importantly, how will 5G benefit Singaporeans and ensure that 5G remains affordable for Singaporeans?5G Technological AdvancementsMr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, as Singapore prepares to roll out 5G network this year, there are companies that are concerned about the security measures of 5G deployment. According to a survey by a United States-based cybersecurity firm, which was released in October 2019, 55% of those surveyed believe that 5G deployment may be avenues for more effective and destructive methods of cyber crime and another 54% thought it may give more opportunities for cyber criminals to attack the organisation.Can the Minister provide by way of an update how ready is Singapore to embrace 5G communication networks and what plans are in place to help enterprises understand and exploit this technology to its fullest while managing its challenges? Does the Ministry have any plans to engage Trade Associations and Chambers to help understand from businesses what they would most need from such a new technology and to implement the new technological equipment and applications?Securing Digital SpacesMr Vikram Nair (Sembawang): Chairman, we often do not realise how widespread and important digitisation is in our lives. Some of the most important digital spaces are what we refer to as the critical information infrastructure which our national Cyber Security Agency (CSA) has been set up to safeguard.12.00 pmCritical Information Infrastructure currently includes the critical data used for sectors such as aviation, healthcare, land transport, maritime, media, security and emergency, water, banking and finance, government and energy.Data is necessary to keep our power plants, hospitals, water, banks and even Government functioning smoothly. The more we digitise and automate, the more important our critical information infrastructure becomes and the greater the risk we face of something goes wrong here.In April last year, the BBC carried a story that stated a survey of security professionals across six countries by the Ponemon Institute found that 90% had been hit by at least one successful attack. This survey covered staff in utilities, energy, health and transport sectors. This report also concluded that a lack of resources and intelligence about the “relentless and continuous” cyber-attacks are the industry’s concern.The key points from this study were that we have to assume attacks will be made and be prepared to deal with them. We also need to be able to guard against human failings, and this may include employees accidentally opening phishing emails and thereby opening the network to attack. There is also a need to share intelligence.I believe the national Cyber Security Agency is focusing on these matters and I would be interested in an update on how the Government is safeguarding the cybersecurity and resilience of our critical information infrastructure.Cyber Security AgencyMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied): Chairman, in 2016, the Government published a document called \"Singapore's Cybersecurity Strategy\". The strategy has four pillars. One, to strengthen the resilience of our critical information infrastructure; two, to mobilise businesses and the community to make cyberspace safe; three, to develop a vibrant cybersecurity eco-system comprising a skilled workforce, technologically advanced companies and strong research collaborations; and four, to step up efforts to forge strong international partnerships.Since 2016, much has happened to focus us on our cybersecurity vulnerabilities. What is the Government's current assessment of the implementation of Singapore's cybersecurity strategy and how far has the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) contributed towards grounding the four pillars of the four strategies?Next, CSA's mandate enables it to direct owners of critical information infrastructures on the essential cybersecurity measures to be adopted and to provide professional consultancy and direct assistance to them, where necessary. How does CSA ensure that its officers have the necessary expertise to devise credible regulations and guidelines? This is particularly needed in vendor management as it is common for data owners to outsource data management to third party providers.I know move on to a query on the role of CSA viz a viz the public sector. Under the Cybersecurity Act regime, owners of critical information infrastructure include the Government, as it is running various essential services. Last year, the Government convened a public sector data security review committee which recently issued its report on enhancing public sector data security. Could the Minister clarify what CSA played in this review?CybersecurityMr Douglas Foo: Mr Chairman, according to a report released on 1 October 2019 by a United States-based cybersecurity firm, Carbon Black, 96% of surveyed companies in Singapore said they have experienced at least one cybersecurity breach in the past 12 months due to external cyber attacks.Of those that had experienced a cyber attack, 48% suffered negative financial impact while 83% reported damage to their reputation. Furthermore, 93% of these organisations reported an increase in cyber attacks in the past year.The report added that 98% of chief information officers and chief information security officers surveyed were concerned how digital transformation projects and the roll-out of the 5G network will further affect cybersecurity in Singapore. More than 250 chief information officers, chief technology officers and chief information security officers from across a range of sectors participated in this survey .According to a study by consumer information provider, Comparitech, which studied 60 countries based on criteria such as percentage of mobiles and computers infected with malware and the number of attacks by cryptominers in 2018, Singapore ranked 10th place in global cybersecurity. This is commendable but reports on probable attacks such as the personal data leak of MINDEF and SAF staff in December 2019 is still a cause for concern.Taking an analogy from the health perspective, our previous experience with SARS taught us the importance of having a readily adoptable response framework, such that today, Singapore’s DORSCON framework has been widely praised in the handling of the COVID-19 outbreak. In the event of a large scale national cyber attack where computer and network viruses can spread speedily, Is there a similar framework in place to reduce and mitigate the dangers of such an outbreak?The Chairman: Mr Cedric Foo, both the cuts, please.Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng: Over the past two to three decades, digital computing technologies have rapidly changed the world, with far ranging implications on businesses and consumers. Particularly, the pace of adoption of digital technologies have accelerated over the last decade. Adoption of digital technologies have resulted in a very connected world, empowering individuals and transforming how consumers, businesses and governments operate.Today, there are many Smart Nation applications, which allow accessibility at any time and thus, bring significant conveniences to Singaporeans.Atthe enterprise level, operational technology or OT allows the direct monitoring and control of critical plants, power and telco grids. Ityields significant control and productivity benefits including preventive maintenance, reducing downtime and quality control just to name a few. OT is expected to assume an expanding role in government and many organisations, enabling greater integration among business processes, physical activities and supporting technology.In this highly connected world, cyber attacks resulting in loss of personal data and even more so attacks on our critical OT systems could be disastrous. Cyber attacks by state actors have also become a \"weapon of choice\" as can be seen in many countries.I would like to ask the Minister how we ensure that the Government and enterprises here can be better protected against this new threat? And how has CSA been contributing to this effort?Falsehoods Pertaining to COVID-19My next cut is on falsehoods pertaining to COVID-19 outbreak. Dozens of protestors in a Ukrainian town attacked buses carrying 72 evacuees from Wuhan, China enroute to a quarantine facility in Ukraine. These demonstrators lighted bonfires and hurled stones in clashes with police officers and national guards. Even armoured personnel carriers were deployed to this small town.The protest was started because of a hoax – a fake email claiming to be from the Ukrainian Health Ministry, falsely claiming that some evacuees had contracted the virus. Indeed, many observers have commented that the challenges of COVID-19 is not just in containing the \"biological virus\" but also in containing the \"psychological fear and irrationality\", and this often arise from fake news and rumours.Fake news on COVID-19 have also surfaced here in Singapore. \"Woodlands MRT station was closed on 28 January when it was actually fully operational\" or \"the Government giving $100 per day to every 'PRC worker' for the 14 day period under the Leave of Absence, when it is be given to eligible employers instead\". These and many other examples of fake news have been circulating around, threatening to undermine our national effort and public trust in addressing the COVID- 19 situation.Fortunately for Singapore, we have a new law called POFMA and in retrospect, this new legislation is indeed timely. I would like to ask the Minister to provide an update on how the Government has dealt with falsehoods pertaining to the COVID-19 outbreak and whether POFMA has been effectively invoked.Chairman, there were also discussions in this House that judges should be the body issuing Correction Notices under POFMA, as opposed to Ministers. Do our recent experiences of implementing POFMA to deal with the outbreak like the current COVID-19 situation, reinforces the Government's position that the issuance of Correction Notices is indeed a job best left to the Executive branch?Providing Trusted InformationMr Ong Teng Koon: Mr Chairman, with the on-going COVID-19 outbreak, we have seen destabilising falsehoods that have hurt our nation. These range from the false closure of Woodlands MRT station; seven countries banning travel to Singapore; to an online falsehood regarding the death of a man in Singapore from COVID-19, when no such death had occurred.POFMA has served to preserve the stability by dealing with false information. But it is also important to ensure that our citizens have access to trusted information.I would like to ask the Minister what he can do to help citizens easily access trusted information from different sources. I also ask the Minister whether he would consider to drop thepaywall on The Straits Times during times of emergency.Communication in a Digitalised WorldProf Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, in as much as COVID-19 has been an abominable threat, it has also been an illuminating lesson on the importance of effective communication and the importance of a robust information infrastructure.Just as medical care has improved significantly since SARS, information and communication technologies have also seen considerable transformations. Our information landscape is paradoxically more fragmented, yet more connected at the same time. It is fragmented and balkanised because there is a plethora of information and communication channels out there. Apart from traditional mainstream media that actively seeking to digitalise, we now have access to vastly more online content, across a range of different platforms including WhatsApp, Telegram, WeChat, Facebook and TikTok.It is therefore very difficult to capture in any parsimonious way, the chequered universe of information that audiences today consume and are influenced by. Despite this seeming fragmentation, our information landscape is concurrently more connected because of growing ownership of personal media devices such as smartphones. Individual consumers across the world are thus linked to one another online, creating content and sharing it across platforms, geographical boundaries and even linguistic barriers now being rapidly eroded by translation software.In a globalised hyper-connected world, our understanding of local situations is thus enriched but also complicated by perspectives extending far beyond our immediate environments. As media consumers, we must contend not only with domestic information flows but manage the onslaught of international news, quite apart from having to discern between legitimate news and false rumours.In such a fraught media landscape, rumours and falsehoods can become virulent social contagions that trigger mob mentality and herd behaviour like the panic buying we experienced and are now witnessing in North America.Hence, our public agencies managing our official communications cannot afford to be insular and track only local discourse around crises of a global nature.When this house passed POFMA in May last year, a mysterious yet highly contagious disease like COVID-19 was but a black swan to be avoided. But the crisis now presents us with a valuable opportunity to test the mettle of our information infrastructures, including official communication channels, public education efforts and regulatory measures such as POFMA.In the wake of COVID-19 therefore, I would like to ask how the Government has sharpened its ability to communicate quickly and effectively to all demographic groups in a digitalised world with porous information boundaries.Importantly, can the ministry share how our capacities to cope with online falsehoods have been stretched and what measures will we take to reinforce them?With specific regard to POFMA and its application, can we conduct more systematic assessment of the effects of the targeted and general corrections approach? Specifically, can we obtain data from the internet intermediaries on the reach and access of the corrections that have been issued so that we may ascertain the effectiveness of the corrections strategy and finetune it accordingly?12.15 pmAdditionally, we must seize the opportunity to survey consumers to comprehend how they have managed the onslaught of falsehoods that they have received in light of COVID-19. What personal measures have they taken to verify the information they have received about the disease? Did they use services such as the gov.sg WhatsApp chat and Factually, and how did they perceive them? How did they react when they encountered suspected falsehoods that had not been issued with POFMA orders? Did they subsequently assume that these falsehoods were true, thereby developing unhealthy cognitive shortcuts? These are all crucial questions that we must answer to strengthen both our official communication strategies and our public education efforts.Finally, while I recognise the value of reaching out to people via platforms they are familiar with such as WhatsApp, how secure and financially sustainable is it for us to use such third-party communication channels? Might it not make better sense in the long run to use existing apps such as SGSecure for official Government alerts during periods of crisis? While I understand that SGSecure was launched and is managed by MHA, should our Whole-of-Government approach not predispose us to more strategically integrate our multiple communication channels that we have? I welcome clarifications on the concerns I have raised.Government Communications in Times of CrisisMr Mohamed Irshad: Chairman, the COVID-19 crisis has shown that there is a need for accurate, timely and trusted public communications between the Government and the people in times of crisis. It is important that the Government provides accurate and timely information to different segments of society to allay public anxieties. Unfortunately, in a situation of information vacuum, distortions, rumours, untruths, misinformation and smears can undermine public confidence and be divisive.Sir, in this regard, allow me to focus on our Government's ability to communicate with our fellow Singaporeans in times of a crisis. To contextualise my questions, I am concerned that Singapore's movement to DORSCON Orange was leaked ahead of its official announcement. So, my questions are as follows.First, how can we tighten the information flow to avoid any future leaks?Second, what are the public communications efforts undertaken by the Government to update Singaporeans on COVID-19? Has the Government tried anything new or different? Are we expecting any improvements along the way to improve our crisis-response handling?Third, how effective and different were the Government's efforts in communicating to Singaporeans during this COVID-19 crisis, in comparison to our response to H1N1 and SARS? And will the Government review the effectiveness of these efforts, especially in the realm of misinformation?Lastly, will the Government continue to make use of the WhatsApp channel such as Gov.sg? To me it seems like a simple way to ensure that we can provide timely and verified information to our people.Digital ReadinessMr Vikram Nair: Digitisation is all around us, making our life simpler and more convenient. As a Smart Government, numerous Government services are now available online and on smartphone apps. And everything from taxes to parking payments can be done with a few clicks on one's phone. Other services like banking, credit card bill payments and even food delivery can be done in the comfort of one's armchair.However, the darker side of information is that misinformation is also freely sent and communicated, through social media and messaging tools such as WhatsApp. There have been numerous examples of this, the most recent being COVID-19 outbreak which my colleagues, Mr Ong Teng Koon, Mr Cedric Foo and Mr Mohamed Irshad have elaborated on.Another area of concern is scams, which really target more vulnerable residents. I, myself, have been subject to a phone call from an Australian phone number claiming to be from Singtel's technical staff. I happened to be at my computer and having attended all the grassroots sessions on scams, quickly googled Singtel scams and discovered that this was actually a well-documented scam and stopped that call. In fact, I have personally become so skeptical that if someone calls me telling me they represent my bank, I will usually say I will call the bank myself, rather than reveal any personal data.However, many others may be more trusting and it is the trusting who get exploited by these scams. There is legislation such as POFMA, that can help the Government take action against online fake news. But, this has its limitations, particularly in the context of: one, fake news that spreads through messaging services rather than online and two, scams which can take advantage of people's trusting nature.Of course, more legislation is one solution but I would be interested to know if the Government is taking any steps help individuals themselves become safe, informed and more discerning online.The Chairman: Mr Darryl David, both cuts please. Three cuts, actually.POFMA and Online FalsehoodsMr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio): Mr Chairman, as we have heard from my Parliamentary colleagues speaking before me, the outbreak of COVID-19 has once again shone the spotlight on the dangers of fake news and their negative impact on social cohesion and trust. Governments around the world are combating the daily deluge of fake news on COVID-19 and Singapore was also not spared. Fake news such as the shutting down of MRT stations and certain shopping malls, closure of schools and rumoured deaths sparked social panic and in some cases, xenophobic reactions against certain communities and restaurants.The deluge of fake news has undermined the ability of governments worldwide to manage the COVID-19 epidemic. Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) went as far as to label fake coronavirus claims as an \"infodemic\" that threatens the management of the outbreak. To manage the \"infodemic\", a WHO representative met tech firms in Silicon Valley recently to urge them through moral suasion to do more to combat the spread of fake news and deliberate false information.While some countries have taken strong positions on the deliberate spread of falsehood regarding COVID-19 by even arresting the perpetrators, the Singapore Government has taken on a different position by issuing correction orders under POFMA. Even though we have taken on a less harsh approach than other countries in this instance, the truth is, that online falsehoods and untruths in general will continue to be a scourge, a scourge to our community.I would thus like to ask how the Government can continue to help Singaporeans guard against deliberate online falsehoods in an increasingly complex digital and media environment?Public Service BroadcastingNext cut, please. The growing popularity of over-the-top (OTT) media services has led to a worldwide decline in viewership rating amongst free-to-air (FTA) TV channels. Although the Nielsen Singapore Media Index Report released in late 2018 found that approximately 3.4 million people in Singapore continued to tune in to FTA TV channels on a weekly basis, the same report also highlighted that there is an upward trend of people consuming on-demand OTT media services.This cuts across all demographics and implies that, over time, fewer people will be exposed to Public Service Broadcasting messages from FTA TV channels and that the Government will need to explore other channels, other platforms and other medium to share these messages with Singaporeans. How is Public Service Broadcasting remaining relevant given the increasing competition for eyeballs from online and foreign platforms?Developing the Media IndustryMy third cut, Mr Chairman. The consumption of media has shifted from over-the-air broadcasting services to over-the-top (OTT) services that I mentioned in my previous cut. These OTT services offer media content directly to consumers via internet streaming; bypassing cable, broadcast and even satellite television platforms that were traditional distributors of media content.Furthermore, the availability of OTT services also mean that consumers today have a greater variety of media content to choose from and are exposed to a wider range of media options from beyond our shores. This shift in media consumption pattern has brought about disruptions to the local media scene as our local media providers need to adapt quickly to offer a greater variety of original content over non-traditional platforms.I would thus like to ask what plans the Government has to develop and support the local media industry in this evolving media environment?Multilingual Government CommunicationsMs Tin Pei Ling: Access to and decisions based on timely and accurate information are important to any democracy. Singaporeans should have access to accurate information in forms that they can easily understand.For a long time, it was highly challenging for older Singaporeans, many of whom were not English educated, to consume Government information as collaterals were typically in the English language. Attempted interpretations sometimes led to misinterpretations. Only selected material such as CPF letters come in different languages.To the Government's credit, the situation has improved significantly. The multilingual WhatsApp service recently introduced during this COVID-19 outbreak has been most useful. We should scale up this multilingual capability to enable all Singaporeans to access all public information in a timely manner.Therefore, what is the Government doing to ensure timely and inclusive access to all Government related information by all Singaporeans? How might the advancement of technology complement this effort?Translation TechnologyMr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol): Mr Chairman, Sir, in the initial days when I set up offices overseas – whether it is China, Kuala Lumpur or Jakarta – I used a translator for the local contracts as well as for meetings. Lately, I have been using online platforms, especially in China and also in Malaysia. The online platforms that they produce locally enables me to do translation in double-quick time.Somehow, I have a thought – what if we have a local project, given our multicultural and multilingual society, a local translation project and then, put it online or using technology to enhance it, it would be wonderful. Because it not only enhances individuals in terms of translating the languages and also the meaning of certain words across different cultures and across different languages, it will also enhance or enable businesses to be able to conduct its business in different languages as well.So, I wanted to ask the Ministry whether it has such plans to be able to put up that online platform or to merge technology with languages.Digital AccessDr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang): Mr Chairman, Sir, to be a Smart Nation, it is important to first build a smart infrastructure. Subsequently, it is important that such we made accessible to all Singaporeans.Sir, in Singapore, we have 4.7 million smart mobile device users. However, not all users have data plans to which, enable them to fully and freely use their smart mobile devices and mobile apps services.Sir, thecosts of subscription of these mobile data plans is an impediment to creating a Smart Nation. The speed at which we educate our smart mobile device users is another barrier, slowing our progress to becoming a digital society.Sir, I would like to propose that all Community Clubs and Residents' Committee Centres be equipped with free access for Digital Services such as online news, e-Government services and e-learning services. This will encourage lifelong learning and active digital lifestyles among Singaporeans.Sir, I wish to ask the Minister to update the House on the digital access scheme for low-income households and to consider providing subsidies for smart mobile devices and digital services for seniors.Future Role of LibraryMr Cedric Foo Chee Keng: Chairman, my cut is on the future role of our public libraries. Traditional paper\tbooks\tare gradually\tbeing\treplaced\tby electronic\tbooks.\tAccording\tto\tPew\tResearch\tCentre, the percentage of US adults that have used or read a print book in the past 12 months has fallen from 71% in 2011 to 65% last year. Conversely, the percentage of US adults that have read an e-book in the past 12 months have increased from 17% in 2011 to 25% in 2019.This trend is not unique to US and is rather common amongst most developed countries. It is particularly pronounced amongst younger readers and increasingly so, younger readers have voiced their preference for reading from electronic devices. Borrowing from e-libraries using various applications such as Overdrive is also increasingly common. Many adults, including Singaporean adults are no longer visiting the library to pick up paper books, as they did in the past.Bearing this in mind, there is a need to review the strategic positioning of future libraries, possibly as nodes to foster community or as common spaces for citizens to socialise or as venues to promote life-long learning. I think the possibilities are exciting and we are eager to hear from the Minister on his views about the future role of our libraries.The Chairman: Minister Iswaran.The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran): Mr Chairman, may I have your permission to display a few slides.The Chairman: Yes, please. [Slides were shown to hon Members.]Mr S Iswaran: It has been an eventful year for MCI. Not least because of viruses, both biological and digital. I want to thank all Members who have spoken and post their questions, queries and suggestions for my Ministry.12.30 pmSeveral Members have spoken on the unprecedented and pervasive impact of digitalisation, as well as the exciting new opportunities it brings – for our economy, for our workers and our people.Digital technology not only enhances enterprise productivity but also creates novel pathways to access new markets. In Southeast Asia alone, the digital economy will treble to US$300 billion by 2025. Exciting careers are emerging in both ICT and non-ICT sectors – in digital marketing, data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI). With the $8 billion Transform and Grow package in the Budget, we are investing significantly in the innovation capacity of our businesses and the skills of our people, so that they can fully realise these benefits. We therefore have good reasons to be optimistic about our digital future.However, the promise of digitalisation is tempered by the uncertainty of change and the fear of disruption to businesses, jobs and even our lives. Enterprises, particularly SMEs, worry that they would not be able to keep pace with digitalisation and risked being marginalised. Some, including mid-career professionals, feel the long-term implications of new technologies like AI. The less tech savvy amongst our citizens are concerned that they are on the wrong side of a digital divide that is ever widening. Moreover, a persistent strain of online misinformation and falsehoods threatens to erode trust in our institutions and, ultimately, our democracy.These are real concerns and they must be effectively addressed so that every business, every worker and every citizen has the assurance and the deep conviction that they too can thrive in a digital future. And that is the mission of my Ministry – to work with all Singaporeans to build a digital future where are opportunities for all, where no one is left behind, and where trust in our institutions is preserved.In this Committee of Supply (COS) debate, Senior Minister of State Ann. Senior Minister of State Janil and I, in responding to Members' queries, will elaborate on how MCI is working on three broad thrusts to forge our digital future together by seizing digital opportunities, ensuring a digital future for all and securing our digital spaces.Let me start with seizing digital opportunities, engaging internationally in digital trade and norm shaping.Mr Cedric Foo has asked about our plans to enter into digital trade agreements and facilitate digital transactions. Mr Chairman, digital is the new frontier for trade, with cross border flows growing exponentially. And just as we did for international trade in goods and service, Singapore is now actively involved in shaping the international rules and norms that will govern digital trade. Our goal and our interest is to work with like-minded partners to ensure an open digital trade architecture and to guard against a new kind of protectionism.That is why Singapore is actively pursuing Digital Economy Agreements (DEAs) with countries like Australia, Chile and New Zealand. These agreements will benefit businesses by providing for secure data flows and seamless cross-border digital payments. For example, when DEAs establish e-invoicing systems that are interoperable across borders, enterprises can transact at a lowercost with their international business partners because of faster invoice processing and payment.I also want to assure Mr Foo that in undertaking these negotiations on DEAs, our Government agencies regularly consult our business interest, business agencies and organisations, in order to establish their interest and ensure that they are adequately captured and reflected in these DEAs.We also need to foster trust in digital systems by building an international consensus on ethical and governance principles for nascent technologies and system threats. At this juncture, Mr Chairman, I want to hasten to add that MCI is not the progenitor of the idea of using facial recognition in Parliament. Mr Chairman, I think you are better placed on that.The Chairman: For that, I am responsible.Mr S Iswaran: Singapore has been an active participant in international platforms to shape global norms in cybersecurity and AI governance.In cybersecurity, Singapore actively participates in the UN Open-Ended Working Group and the 25-member Group of Government Experts, to develop a rules-based cyber space and to implement norms for responsible state behaviour.Earlier this year, I also launched the second edition of our Model AI Governance Framework at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos. The framework translates broad governance principles into practical guidelines for businesses who are implementing AI solutions.Notably, diverse organisations, from Omada Health in San Francisco, to our DBS Bank and Pymetrics, a HR solutions provider, have adopted the best practices in the Model Framework. So, in other words, it is gaining recognition, acceptance and traction.Seizing digital opportunities also requires world-class infrastructure and I want to like to highlight two important initiatives in this regard.The first is 5G, which will be the backbone of our digital economy. We are committed to building a world-class, secure and resilient 5G network in Singapore. And that is why network design, resilience and security have been key requirements in IMDA's 5G Call for Proposal (CFP), which was launched last October.The Government is also collaborating with industry partners, a point that both Mr Douglas Foo and Mr Mohamad Irshad have raised, to develop our 5G eco-system, learn from early trials for future development application and position Singapore at the forefront of global innovation in 5G applications and services.Mr Irshad asked about the status of 5G rollout in Singapore. We have made good progress. At the close of the Call for Proposal (CFP) on 17 February, IMDA had received three submissions from the incumbent telcos– one each from Singtel and TPG, as well as a joint submission from StarHub and M1. IMDA is evaluating the proposals and aims to announce the award of the 5G spectrum by mid-2020. We are on track to commence 5G deployment this year, achieve substantial coverage in the next two years, and nationwide standalone coverage by 2025.Mr Douglas and Mr Irshad have also asked about the benefit andcost of 5G. The initial deployment is expected to be in certain industry sectors and consumer applications where there is keen interest to explore innovative 5G use-cases. For example, PSA has had promising results in using 5G technology to control its Automated Guided Vehicles and automated cranes, in another step towards realising its vision of being a Smart Port. In terms ofcost, similar to 3G and 4G services, thecost of service plans and handsets are expected to moderate as the technology matures.Mr Irshad has also asked how we are modernising our logistics networks. This is an important point because driven by e-commerce growth, parcel deliveries have grown rapidly worldwide. In Singapore, around 200,000 parcels are delivered daily, with e-commerce projected to grow at 12% to 20% annually over the next five years.So, it is neither productive nor sustainable for this growing volume of packages to all be delivered to the doorstep. We do need alternative solutions. We must enhance Singapore's last-mile delivery infrastructure. And that is why we have decided to deploy a nationwide parcel locker network. The network will be owned by IMDA and accessible to all logistics players. It will offer greater choice to consumers, while raising the productivity of the urban logistics sector. Senior Minister of State Sim Ann will further elaborate on the national parcel locker network initiative.The goal of our DEAs and investment in world-class infrastructure is to benefit all our businesses. So, we are helping our companies, especially our SMEs, adopt digital solutions through IMDA's now well-known SMEs Go Digital initiative. A recent Singapore Business Federation (SBF) survey found that 94% of enterprises recognise the importance of digital technology in transforming businesses. So, the awareness is high and I think that is a starting point from which we can work.But we can do more, especially to help our enterprises scale and access global markets through digital channels, as emphasised by Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Mr Ong Teng Koon. So, IMDA is launching a new initiative, under the overarching's SMEs Go Digital, and it is called Grow Digital, which will help SMEs access overseas opportunities without the need to establish a in-market physical presence. By connecting to B2B and B2C e-commerce platforms, our SMEs will benefit from smart matching with potential overseas clients, prompt access to financing offers through the platforms and integration with logistics companies for last-mile delivery.Grow Digital will also help SMEs fully utilise Singapore's network of free trade agreements (FTAs) and our DEAs to extend their business linkages and grow their customer base.More broadly, IMDA will continue to work with Government agencies and other stakeholders on the Industry Digital Plans (IDPs) for various sectors, such as sea transport, food services and accountancy. These IDPs guide SMEs on the digital solutions and training available at each stage of their digital journey and growth.IMDA and Enterprise Singapore (ESG) launched the Food Services IDP in November 2018. A Nielsen study commissioned by ESG last year found that Food Services SMEs who had adopted digital solutions found them easy to implement, which is important, and 70% of these companies have seen shorter waiting times and greater satisfaction for customers. So, there is a tangible benefit.Building on this momentum, the Government will develop IDPs and pre-approve more digital solutions to cover all 23 ITM sectors, up from the current 10. Through these IDPs, SMEs in sectors, such as construction, food manufacturing and adult and early childhood education, will benefit from dedicated digital roadmaps to help transform their business and upskill their workers.Ultimately, this array of initiatives I have outlined to help our businesses make the digital transformation, must yield benefits and opportunities for our people. We know that digital disruption can cause profound anxiety for mature workers, especially those who may be more advanced in their careers and not have a technology background. They are, in fact, the focus of the Next Bound of SkillsFuture that Deputy Prime Minister Heng announced in the Budget. We want to pay special attention to these mid-career workers, many of whom are in their 40s and 50s, and most keenly feel the uncertainty caused by technological disruption, but they also stand to gain from the new jobs that are being created if the opportunity is presented and they have the requisite skills.Mr Kevin Lee who went through Company-Led Training (CLT) under TeSA is an example. Mr Lee used to be a senior executive in sales and marketing at several leading technology MNCs. So, he was doing non-tech business in tech companies. After nine months of \"deep-skilling\" with AI Singapore, he is now an AI consultant, helping organisations figure out how best to use AI and machine learning technologies.12.45 pmSo, this is an important part of what we are doing with our mature workers already, but Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Ong Teng Koon have asked what more we can do, especially for mature workers and those who do not have a tech background.The TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) programme is a tripartite effort between Government agencies, industry and NTUC to equip workers with digital skills and place them in good jobs in the Info-Communications and Technology (ICT) sector. IMDA works with trade associations like SG Tech to raise awareness of TeSA. SMEs also qualify for higher levels of funding support, especially for certain types of short-form training programmes.Since its launch in April 2016, about 100,000 training places have been committed, so a progress from the number I gave earlier this year. For the Company-Led Training (CLT) programme and Tech Immersion and Placement Programme (TIPP), which are long-form courses – in other words, they are courses over a long duration and therefore go deeper – 90% of trainees successfully stayed in the job a year after the completion of training. So, there is traction in the market. The employers value and the employees get a job that they are able to secure and work from.As part of the next bound for TeSA, IMDA is piloting a new programme, TeSA Mid-Career Advance, for professionals aged 40 and above. Our aim is to lessen the friction that gets in the way of mature workers being able to benefit from opportunities being created in tech sectors or the fast-growing tech areas. We expect to create in the ICT, ICM sectors over 20,000 jobs in the next two to three years.We want to, on the one hand, make it easier for employers to bring these workers into their team, lessening some of the initialcosts that might get in the way, and, at the same time, enable workers to bridge into these roles with the appropriate training.Under TeSA Mid-Career Advance, the Government will support companies to hire and train mid-career professionals for tech-related jobs, regardless of whether they have an ICT background. Participating companies will benefit from access to a bigger pool of local talent as well as Government subsidies to partially offset thecost of the training and the salaries for the duration of the training. The mid-career individual will benefit from employment in a growth sector while gaining exposure, training and mentorship for up to 24 months.For a start, we have set aside $70 million for this programme. Ten companies have already come on board and they have committed to about 500 positions covering many roles, both tech and tech-lite – from data analysts, cybersecurity engineers and cloud computing engineers, to business analysts, project managers and sales specialists. Over the next two to three years, we aim to place a further 2,000 Singaporeans in companies through this programme.Mr Cedric Foo and Ms Tin Pei Ling have also asked how we will address the need to augment our local talent pipeline with the requisite talent from abroad in selected, emerging fields. The Government recognises that tech companies in Singapore and others whom we want to attract need specialists from overseas in certain fields. That is why we have programmes like Tech@SG, which provides fast-growth tech companies with access to business networks and talent, so as to build their teams in Singapore.In addition, our economic agencies like EDB, IMDA and DISG, which is Digital Industry Singapore and working with the tech companies largely, work closely with them and see how they can be helped to secure the talent that is needed to complement the local pool and enable them to execute their strategies competitively.In addition, and I think this goes to the point that Ms Tin Pei Ling raised, IMDA and Workforce Singapore help our companies to leverage this specialised expertise from abroad to develop new skill sets amongst Singaporeans – in other words, a transfer of capability – through the Capability Transfer Programme. That is a conscious part of this effort, even as we bring in talent from abroad to complement our local talent base.Before I move away from the topic of talent, Mr Cedric Foo raised the point about what is happening in our Universities. I think the details and the more complete response will be given in the MOE Committee of Supply, but I think it would suffice for me to say that both in terms of quantity and quality, the intakes for the courses pertaining to computer science and so on have been rising. We see this as being a very rich pipeline that will then enter the industry and meet its needs.Beyond jobs and businesses, as more citizens embrace technology to enrich their lives or access public services, we must make sure that no one feels out-paced by the change or left behind. Senior Minister of State Sim Ann will explain how we are increasing support for low-income households, seniors and children to ensure our digital future is an inclusive one.In this mission, our libraries also have a very important role. Our libraries epitomise the spirit of the SG Together movement, bringing our people, volunteers and partners together in a supportive learning environment. The revamped library@harbourfront at VivoCity exemplifies this. In just one year since its opening in January last year, it has held over 360 programmes, more than a third of them run by members of the community. In other words, volunteers.These unique partnerships form the model for the Libraries and Archives Plan (LAP25), and this goes to the point that Mr Cedric Foo raised. This is a five-year strategic plan for our libraries and archives. Over the next several months, NLB will be engaging with various communities, partners and stakeholders on its future strategies, collections and services to ensure that it continues to meet the needs and aspirations of Singaporeans in an evolving learning and knowledge landscape.But to fully derive the benefits of digitalisation, we must protect ourselves from the threats in the digital domain. That is why we have instituted Digital Defence as the sixth pillar of Total Defence – to underscore the importance of ensuring that digital spaces where we increasingly interact, transact and rely on for information, are safe, secure and trustworthy.Mr Cedric Foo has asked how we ensure that we are adequately protected in this environment. Ms Sylvia Lim also raised some questions pertaining to CSA and the work we do with the Critical Information Infrastructure (CII). Cybersecurity is key, in particular to safeguard our Critical Information Infrastructure from cyber threats. CSA has been conducting regular reviews as well as exercises with the 11 CII sectors and the component agencies. But as Members can well appreciate, this is an iterative and on-going process, because the threats keep evolving and therefore, our capacity to deal with them must also keep evolving in tandem.Later this year, we will also launch a Safer Cyberspace Masterplan to proactively monitor and prevent cyber threats and cyber crime, implement baseline security standards and increase the adoption of these safeguards by enterprises and citizens.Data protection also takes on added importance in this context. That is why we are reviewing the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) – to support, on the one hand, the legitimate needs of businesses to harness data for innovative products and services, while protecting consumers' interests and increasing the accountability of organisations. Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary will elaborate on MCI's new measures to enhance cybersecurity and data security.But we do have to go beyond cybersecurity and data protection, because ultimately, our aim is to uphold the values of our society, the strength of our institutions, and preserve our common spaces.Today, the online space is where our hard-won cohesion could fray and splinter. In the digital age, our common spaces are no longer just physical. That is where our laws against online falsehoods become very important, a point that Mr Darryl David has asked.POFMA has been used to place factual corrections next to the grievous falsehoods which distorted or fabricated facts. These falsehoods have pertained to the COVID-19 situation, police procedures and the management of public funds, among other things. If Singaporeans are duped into believing such falsehoods, it can sow fear, cause panic and erode trust in our institutions. That is why in response, we have used the powers under POFMA to juxtapose the truth with the falsehoods at the source, so that our citizens can see both and draw their own conclusions.In this fight against online falsehoods, it is heartening to see Singaporeans stepping up to do their part. Amid many online rumours that have been circulating in the context of COVID-19, a group of students from NTU started a fact-checking initiative called \"Sure Anot\" – a bit of Singlish there – aimed at older Singaporeans. They developed a guide for seniors to assess information they receive, based on NLB's digital literacy framework – \"Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate\". They also collaborated with an independent fact-checking outfit to share reports of debunked rumours in Facebook and WhatsApp groups.In a similar vein, I am also glad to share with Members that there are many initiatives from academia to study the challenges of the online information eco-system. In particular, NUS is setting up a Centre for Trusted Internet and Community that will drive research and strengthen public discourse on the impact of the internet and online harms. Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary will share the details.All these strands of work to sustain trust and cohesion through information and communications were put to the test when the COVID-19 virus broke out. Mr Ong Teng Koon, Mr Mohamad Irshad and Prof Lim Sun Sun have all asked about the lessons learned from the experience. Mr Cedric Foo has asked specifically about the role that POFMA played in dealing with falsehoods about the virus.COVID-19 is not a medical and public health challenge, it is also a psychological battle against fear and uncertainty. As Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong put it, \"Fear can actually do more harm than the virus itself\". The Government has therefore sought to allay the fears of our citizens and keep their trust by being transparent about the situation, the measures we are taking and the reasons for doing so, and giving regular information on the evolving situation.Some have caused anxiety in our population by putting out falsehoods. POFMA correction orders were used to swiftly expose them by placing the truth alongside. Firmer levers were used when a recalcitrant Facebook page repeatedly posted falsehoods and refused to carry any corrections. It is abundantly clear that it would have been much harder to quell the spread of misinformation and keep the calm of our society without this set of POFMA measures, which are designed specifically to address falsehoods in the online space.But to focus only on the use of POFMA for COVID-19 would be to miss the wood for the trees. MCI has also conducted a major public communication and education campaign through the print and broadcast mainstream media, Government websites and social media. The details are on the screen. Alas, removing The Straits Times' paywall is beyond my ken, but I do hope that the relevant people will heed Mr Ong Teng Koon's plaintive call and do the necessary.We have collaborated with Mediacorp and local celebrities in all four official languages and also in dialects such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Hakka and Hainanese. This communication campaign would have been much more challenging if we did not have the national platforms with the content and reach to engage and connect with Singaporeans.1.00 pmMr Darryl David asked how PSB will remain relevant amid the changing landscape. PSB has long been a key source of trusted information and common experiences. But with these changes in media landscape, we know that Singaporeans enjoy access to multiple media platforms but it is imperative that they also continue to access local content that reflects and strengthens our national voice and character. The Government will, therefore, invest more in PSB to ensure the quality and relevance to Singaporeans of this important medium.Prof Lim has asked whether we can take a more strategic approach and integrate the multiple comms channels onto existing Government mobile apps like SG Secure. In today’s fragmented media landscape, we have to bring the information to our people through the different platforms that they rely on. That is the sheer reality of it. The diversity of channels is, therefore, an inevitable consequence. But I want to assure Prof Lim that, as part of MCI's on-going effort, we are working with Smart Nation Digital Office (SNDGO) and other agencies to see how we can further integrate and coordinate these different channels. But we should not let that overarching objective get in the way of responding to needs as they emerge, as they did in recent times with COVID-19.Already, amid the COVID-19 situation, our efforts have out through new digital platforms. Digital display panels in HDB estates and Gov.sg WhatsApp channel have given almost real-time updates to Singaporeans. We have seen a huge surge in subscribers – over 650,000 in just five weeks – to gov.sg's WhatsApp service which issues regular messages in the four official languages.This broad-based Government communication effort has been recognised and appreciated by our citizens and many others. From mid-to-late February, REACH conducted an online poll to understand public sentiments and more than 80% of Singaporeans or Singapore residents who were polled indicated that the Government had provided sufficient information about the COVID-19 situation. So, we are getting through, communicating, but we can always do better.Mr Chairman, I would like to conclude by going back to where I began. It is clear that the digital future holds much promise for Singapore but there are real concerns over the impact of technology on our enterprises and jobs. Be it investment in world-class infrastructure to seize digital opportunities; ensuring digital opportunities for all by helping our mid-career professionals secure jobs in the growing ICT sector; or education and enforcement to strengthen the digital defence of our common spaces – our goal is to forge a digital future where our businesses have the abilities and capabilities to thrive, our workers have good jobs with the requisite skills, and our citizens lead fulfilling lives by embracing emerging digital technologies. And the Ministry of Communications and Information is resolutely committed to working together with all Singaporeans to forge this digital vision for our nation.The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Dr Janil Puthucheary): Mr Chairman, digitalisation can bring greater convenience, efficiency, participation and better services for all. A secure digital infrastructure will be important to allow our citizens to live safely, work productively and enjoy themselves online.Mr Cedric Foo, Mr Vikram Nair and Ms Sylvia Lim asked about the Government's efforts on cybersecurity. The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) has been working to protect our Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs). This is the first pillar of Singapore’s cybersecurity strategy. These systems are critical for providing essential services, like energy and water.Since the SingHealth Committee of Inquiry (COI) concluded a year ago, CSA has worked with CII sector leads to strengthen their defences and to implement the Committee’s recommendations. To date, the Energy, Infocomm, Security and Emergency sectors have fully implemented all the recommendations or compensating controls. Other sectors have made good progress and implemented measures for between 70% and 90% of their CIIs. We will continue to track their progress and enable the further implementation of these measures.It is crucial to strengthen our defences on operational technology (OT) systems as well. These are systems that control physical and industrial processes and manufacturing equipment. As many of the CIIs rely on these, attacks on OT systems can cause physical disruption. To address this, CSA has launched the Operational Technology (OT) Masterplan in October last year to raise awareness and competencies in OT cybersecurity.Mr Douglas Foo asked if Singapore has a cyber-response framework similar to the DORSCON Framework used to handle COVID-19. There are broad similarities in how we respond. CSA has a framework to calibrate the approach to mitigate potential threats. Should there be an incident of concern, this framework also helps us to coordinate an appropriate national response to secure our cyberspace – a response that will involve multiple stakeholders and agencies as well as private sector entities. Similar to containing COVID-19, in cybersecurity, we need processes to give us an early warning and a multi-stakeholder approach to mitigate any impact of a large-scale cyberattack.We do this by ensuring timely information sharing from multiple sources. Under the Cybersecurity Act, CII owners are required to monitor systems and report incidents to CSA. CSA then works closely with industry and international partners to share cyber intelligence.However, we must plan on the basis that we cannot prevent all cyber incidents. Determined attackers will always find new ways to breach our systems. So, we must be vigilant and be prepared to respond to and recover quickly from any attack. To these ends, CSA conducts regular exercises, such as Exercise Cyber Star, to prepare the nation in the event of a widespread cyberattack.As part of Singapore’s Cybersecurity Strategy, the Government also works with businesses and the general public to improve their cybersecurity. For example, SingCERT provides regular advisories about identified vulnerabilities. Beyond the CIIs, CSA will continue to expand broad efforts to protect cyberspace through the new Safer Cyberspace Masterplan. This aims to make Singapore one of the most cyber-secure countries in the world, benefiting all.The plan involves, firstly, securing Singapore’s digital core; secondly, safeguarding activities in cyberspace; and thirdly, empowering a cyber-savvy population. Details on this Safer Cyberspace Masterplan will be announced later in the year.A growing area of concern is the Internet of Things (IoT). This refers to devices, like home routers, smart home hubs, which many of us may have in our homes and offices. We expect that the number of these devices will grow significantly as they become more and more useful. This poses a challenge because these devices typically have weak security and can be exploited by attackers, for example, in a distributed denial-of-service attack to flood systems and disrupt operations.IMDA and CSA have been working closely to address these challenges and to educate users about these risks and the precautions that they can take to secure their devices. Going forward, CSA will be launching the Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme (CLS) for home routers and smart home hubs. The scheme will raise consumer awareness on more secure products and aims to encourage manufacturers to adopt additional cybersecurity safeguards.IMDA will be setting minimum security requirements for home routers. This will improve baseline standards for such devices and will be a prerequisite to attaining the cybersecurity label. Together, IMDA and CSA will be launching a joint Public Consultation to seek feedback on this. In addition, IMDA will also be publishing an IoT Cyber Security Guide to offer enterprise users and their vendors better guidance on the deployment of IoT technology.CSA has made good progress since the launch of the national Cybersecurity Strategy in 2016. But the Government alone cannot secure our cyberspace. CSA will continue to work with individuals and businesses to enhance Singapore's cybersecurity.Ms Lim asked about CSA's role in the Public Sector Data Security Review Committee. CSA works closely with other Government agencies to enhance public sector data security. However, while related, data security and cybersecurity are different. Data security is concerned about the protection of data – whether this data is collected online or not. On the other hand, cybersecurity is concerned with the protection of systems, including, for example, train signalling. It extends beyond data protection. Both are essential and complementary.To Ms Lim's point on vendor management, organisations are ultimately responsible for their obligations. These obligations continue when they decide to outsource certain functions. If they do so, they should perform due diligence to select the right third party providers with proven track records and maintain sufficient oversight over this outsourcing of functions.I agree with Ms Tin Pei Ling that data is critical in this digital age. Data needs to be secure and interoperable to unlock its potential, to support innovation and to benefit consumers. The Trusted Data Sharing Framework introduced in June 2019 laid the groundwork for data interoperability and provided a common language as well as contractual templates to help organisations in Singapore share data in a trusted manner.Internationally, Singapore is contributing to common data protection principles, for example, the ASEAN Framework on Digital Data Governance as well as the APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules and their Privacy Recognition for Processors Systems. This network of partnerships that Singapore has and our Digital Economy Agreements will also facilitate cross-border interoperability and collaboration.We will introduce a new Data Portability Obligation in the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) so that individuals can have their data transmitted between organisations in a commonly used format. This will also improve data interoperability.On Ms Tin's questions on data centres, Singapore’s data centre market is expected to grow about 5% annually until 2024, according to a 2019 report by Cushman and Wakefield. We are mindful about the environmental impact of these data centres. As part of our nation-wide efforts to combat climate change, IMDA is working with EDB to improve the efficiency of these data centres.Mr Ong Teng Koon and Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked about Singapore's data protection regime. As we generate and store more data online, it is essential that our regulations enable the innovative, legitimate use of data and simultaneously safeguard consumer interest. The collection, use and disclosure of personal data are regulated by laws like the PDPA. This includes personal data shared between organisations and data collected through facial recognition technology. Personal data must be protected and used for reasonable purposes, like security, as mentioned by Mr Yee. Conversely, the example cited by Mr Ong of the sale of personal data to other organisations without consent would be in breach of the PDPA. Organisations are responsible for expunging the personal data when it no longer serves the purposes for which it was collected. Public agencies are held to similar standards under the Public Sector (Governance) Act.In order to promote the responsible use of facial recognition technologies, the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) and the Government Data Office will publish guides on the responsible use of biometric technology this year. The guides will include best practices and policies on the end-to-end management of data collected via such technology.For online consent agreements, the PDPA continues to apply. Organisations must ensure that online consent agreements are clear and spell out the reasonable purposes for which the individuals’ consent is being sought. The PDPC also updated the Guide to Notification last year, providing organisations examples of how to utilise just-in-time notifications and obtain dynamic consent. This allows individuals to make informed decisions as and when relevant, instead of one-off lengthy consent agreements.As part of the effort to continually support data-driven innovation and to strengthen the accountability of these organisations and consumer trust, the Government is reviewing the PDPA. The key proposed amendments under this review include: (a) obligating organisations to notify affected individuals and the PDPC of significant data breaches; (b) strengthening PDPC's enforcement powers; and (c) instilling accountability practices like risk assessments for organisations. We plan to amend the PDPA later this year.I announced on 28 February 2020 that the Government will be sharing more data with businesses and researchers to spur innovation. As we do so, the high standards of data protection that the Government imposes on itself must be extended to third parties using three guiding principles. First, the data is shared with these non-Government entities (NGEs) only when there is a specified purpose that will benefit the public. Second, as a general rule, only de-identified data is shared. Third, access controls and safeguards should be spelt out in contracts with these NGEs.Protecting our citizens online includes shielding consumers from scam calls. IMDA has worked with the telcosto block international scammers from making their phone call look like they are coming from commonly spoofed numbers, such as 999 and 995. We will move on to introduce measures to stop international scammers from trying to spoof numbers that look like they are a local number, targeting our citizens by introducing a requirement to have the \"+\" symbol as a prefix for all overseas calls. We hope this will help consumers better identify international spoof calls and reject them.The Government will continue to develop additional measures to combat scams so that our citizens can be better protected. MCI will work closely with other agencies in the newly formed Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams announced by MHA to strengthen our collective efforts to tackle this problem.1.15 pmMr Darryl David and Mr Vikram Nair asked about measures to guard against deliberate online falsehoods. These can threaten our multiculturalism and the harmony of our society. We must protect our social cohesion in the real world and online to uphold the shared values of Singapore. The Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods recommended for the Government to support fact-checking initiatives and strengthen public education to build an informed and discerning citizenry. We will do so together with a range of partners.One timely development is the National University of Singapore (NUS)'s decision to establish aCentre for Trusted Internet and Community.The Centre will research how societies discern online harms and how to build responsible public discourse. MCI welcomes this effort. This will be an important academic complement to existing efforts that nurture healthy, well-informed and inclusive online activity.Finally, Chairman, we must support all workers as our economy digitalises. Technological disruptions have changed how we work, creating new roles and new manpower demands. The Government will continue to support all Singaporeans to capitalise on these opportunities and to meet industry needs.Mr Ong and Ms Tin asked about tech talent in Singapore. We must work with stakeholders to expand our talent pool and strengthen career developmental pathways for emerging roles. To grow our workforce, we have collaborations with the private sector. We are very glad that industry, for example, Apple and Alibaba collaborate with us. IMDA has been collaborating with them to develop programmes for Secondary school students to help them develop some experience in marketing and pitching business ideas as the develop the technological skills, applying some of these skills to problems that interest them; for example, waste identification and recyclable materials. These industry-led programmes allow young minds in Singapore to develop technological skills, contribute to the causes that they find meaningful and prepare themselves for their future.We will have to continue to make sure all Singaporeans – including those who did not learn tech skills in schools – are supported as they take on these technology-based roles. We will actively groom the innovation talent through mentorships, overseas attachments and structured training to position Singapore as a digital hub.Under SkillsFuture, the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) initiative supports professionals to upgrade their skills for the Digital Economy. These programmes include the Company-Led Training (CLT) and the Cyber Security Associates and Technologists (CSAT) programme. These support the transition of both ICT professionals as well as non-ICT professionals into technology-based jobs.So, they provide an opportunity for people who are in atechnology-based profession toshift their skillset, shift their career focus as well as people who have not had specific ICT training to develop ICT skills and move into a technology-based job.Not just the companies, not just the Government, but also our trade associations are also actively contributing to these efforts.Under the Career Compass initiative, experienced ICT mentors from the Singapore Computer Society partnered Workforce Singapore to provide career guidance to aspiring technology professionals. SGTech also manages Professional Conversion Programmes with platform companies such as Salesforce to train and place workers into new roles. These new roles include examples such as data protection officers (DPOs) and cybersecurity professionals. There are many new jobs and exciting opportunities that are being created, and we have to increase our effort to support the professional development in these new roles.I agree with Mr Patrick Tay on the need to upskill these DPOs. As he noted, the PDPCs DPO Competency Roadmap and Training Framework aims to support this. PDPC will collaborate with partners such as NTUC, to roll out additional courses and targets to train 500 DPOs in the first year. I encourage more workers to tap on such training to deepen their skills in data protection and seize the opportunities in this growing field.Other than data protection, cybersecurity, as we have discussed, is a critical enabler for digitalisation and we will need more cybersecurity professionals to protect our cyber space. CSA is launching the SG Cyber Talent initiative to reach out to more than 20,000 individuals over three years, through existing and new programmes. This will build a pipeline of cybersecurity professionals to support Singapore's ambition to be a cybersecurity hub.Under the SG Cyber Talent programme, CSA will introduce two new programmes this year.First, CSA will work with the cybersecurity community and educators to nurture young Singaporeans with an aptitude in cybersecurity. This will provide participants with an arena for cyber sparring for mentorship for customised training and some support to participate in overseas competitions. Secondly, CSA will build communities of practice, offering training in cybersecurity and connecting cybersecurity leadership to global best practises and technologies. This will equip these leaders to secure their organisations more effectively.Singapore's cybersecurity workforce is important not just for the development of a competitive digital economy, but also for our national security. To Ms Lim's query on how CSA ensures that it has the expertise and knowledge for its mission, CSA has a Cybersecurity Professional Scheme and a Cybersecurity Competency Framework. Together, these guide the professional development of our offices and allow CSA to attract and retain people with the right skill sets. CSA Academy has also been working with global partners to provide intermediate and advanced training for CSA, as well as for the critical information infrastructure (CII) sectors since 2018. To date, the Academy has trained about 200 professionals.Mr Chairman, I have spoken about MCI's efforts to secure our digital infrastructure to protect our cohesive society and to support all workers. With this approach, we can seize the digital opportunities and embrace digitalisation with confidence together.The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann): Sir, like the rest of the world, Singapore is headed towards a digital future. It is MCI's mission to ensure this digital future is also a brighter one for all Singaporeans.In my speech, I will address three key strategies to realise this goal. First, help citizens get more out of the digital economy by improving last-mile delivery infrastructure.\tSecond, strengthen social cohesion by making trusted information widely available. And third, help all citizens to be digitally connected.Mr Mohamed Irshad talked about disruption and future prospects for post as well as parcels. Members would recall SingPost had a number of service lapses in 2018 and early 2019. We are in a different place this year. SingPost has been improving service delivery since 2019 to rebuild public trust. They have extended delivery hours for peak periods, improved staff remuneration and also hired more postmen.Consumer complaints fell by about 40% in December 2019 compared to 2018. Consumer satisfaction has also grown. SingPost's stronger performance reflects the efforts they have put in. MCI and IMDA will continue to work closely with SingPost to enhance its service delivery.Mr Irshad also asked about the future prospects of postal industry. In Singapore, the popularity of e-commerce has led to a steady increase in parcel deliveries. But given Singapore's urban context and consumers' busy lifestyles, doorstep deliveries often mean missed deliveries. Our postal infrastructure must evolve to offer practical alternatives to doorstep deliveries so that all logistics service providers, and not just SingPost can overcome thiscostly challenge.Building on the success of the Locker Alliance pilot, IMDA will launch a nationwide deployment of 1,000 locker stations in HDB estates, MRT stations and Community Centres by the end of 2022. This will complement existing commercial locker stations and doorstep deliveries. The goal is to place a locker station around five minutes' walk from every HDB block. Users can collect their parcels on their way to work, or on their way home, any time of the day. Merchants and logistics service providers will also enjoy greater delivery efficiency. This may result in more competitive delivery prices for consumers. IMDA has received strong support from major e-commerce marketplaces like Qoo10 and Shopee, and logistics service providers like Qxpress. IMDA will also partner with SingPost to leverage its extensive postal service experience.As we strengthen infrastructure, we must also safeguard our social cohesion. We believe all citizens should have access to trusted information. We do this in two ways. First, our media industry creates compelling content for its audiences. MCI supports the growth of the media sector so it stays ahead of the curve. Second, our Government communications are always centred on citizens. MCI varies the modes of engagement, using face-to-face and multilingual communications to connect with all Singaporeans. Let me cover them in turn.The media industry plays a significant role in keeping citizens well informed. Mr Darryl David asked how the Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) can continue to be relevant. PSB has evolved alongside citizens' consumption preferences by providing customised content across multiple platforms.For example, Mediacorp's vernacular programmes are taking a multi-platform approach. To widen audience engagement, Vasantham brought the Deepavali Countdown Show 2019 directly to audiences in Little India. Viewers were able to celebrate in Little India with the \"live\" show, and catch the telecast on meWatch and Vasantham's social media platforms. Tech-savvy younger audiences can also enjoy more online content tailored for them. IMDA is partnering popular digital platforms such as The Smart Local and Viddsee to produce a wide range of drama programmes and documentaries, which will be available this year.Mr Darryl David also asked about plans to develop the media industry amid competition from over-the-top (OTT) media services, such as Netflix. The Skills Framework for Media, maps out career pathways and skills in emerging trends such as immersive media, to help media professionals stay relevant. Mentorship programmes like WritersLab, ProducersLab and the Story Lab Apprenticeship also help media professionals sharpen their tools of the trade. These programmes will benefit over 200 media professionals over the next two years.IMDA is also helping local media content go global. I am glad to see the rise of \"made with Singapore\" content in recent years. One example is the drama series \"Food Lore\" by home-grown company, Bert Pictures and prominent directors in Asia. The drama has sparkled on the international stage and done us proud. Through initiatives like the Capability Partnership Programme, IMDA will continue to collaborate with global players such as Facebook and CJ ENM Hong Kong, and strengthen the expertise of local media companies.Ms Tin Pei Ling asked how the Government ensures timely access to information for Singaporeans. This brings me to my second point on citizens. We are strengthening last-mile engagement to connect with citizens face-to-face. Strong community partnership amplifies these efforts.For example, 3,000 Silver Generation (SG) Ambassadors actively engage seniors with regard to the Merdeka Generation Package or the MGP. One of the SG Ambassadors is Mr Kong Seet Kiang. Already 70 years old, he has been volunteering three days a week since 2015 and a familiar face among Bukit Timah seniors.MGP roadshows are also in full swing in the heartlands. With the deep involvement of the community, the Government has engaged nearly 200,000 MG seniors and their families at over 200 roadshows and events.Good translation is essential for important messages to reach all segments of Singapore society. MCI's Translation Department (TD) undertakes the most important pieces of translation work for the Government. It also champions high standards when it comes to translated work produced by all public agencies, whether done in-house or outsourced.Over the years, MCI initiated various moves to boost our translation capabilities, producing increasing quantities of translated materials, at good quality and at speed. MCI is now ready to consolidate these moves. We will signal a higher level of aspiration, by repositioning MCI's translation department (TD) as the whole-of-Government Centre of Excellence for Translation.The Centre of Excellence will drive three key workstreams: talent, technology and partnerships.1.30 pmFirst, we will groom translation talents and upskill industry practitioners. This is done through programmes like the MCI Information Service (Translation) Scholarship and the Translation Talent Development Scheme.Second, we use technology to improve the speed and quality of Government translation work. In the national fight against COVID-19, our machine translation engine, known as SG Translate, has been supporting the translation of public communications materials in vernacular languages. As SG Translate produces translations that suit the local context, it is more accurate than other machine translation tools. Mr Teo Ser Luck asked how we are involving more partners to enhance translation technology. We fully agree partnerships are important to share knowledge and expertise. That is why MCI is launching a new pilot project, SG Translate Together, to rally Singaporeans to improve SG Translate. From 2021, MCI will invite selected groups, including businesses and schools, to submit quality translations through a web portal. The more quality inputs we receive, the more data for training the engine, and the stronger the technology’s underlying AI will become. We will open up the web portal progressively to more users. This will benefit more practitioners while also growing the engine’s capability.Third, MCI is also strengthening partnerships to close translation gaps. For example, we are working with organisations with skilled translators to meet periodic surges in translation demand within the public sector. We also have retainer arrangements to boost vetting capabilities. Here I want to say a very big thank our translation partners. There is so much more we can do together. Let us continue our partnership to ensure strong Government communications for our citizens.If translation is the bridge to connect our multiracial communities, then preserved records open a window to Singapore's shared heritage. To strengthen cohesiveness, we must remember the shared history that binds us. The National Library and the National Archives of Singapore (NAS) are widening public access to national and social memories. At the on-going Legal Deposit display at Bedok Public Library, Singaporeans can access a vast array of publications from yesteryear. One of them is the book \"Assembly Songs\", a valuable compilation of school songs of the past.In total, the Legal Deposit collection has more than 1.37 million items contributed by publishers. With the updated National Library Board (NLB) Act empowering NLB to archive digital materials, NLB has also added 40,000 Singapore websites to its digital collection, preserved for generations to enjoy. The NAS will be launching a crowdsourcing initiative to capture treasured sights and sounds of Singapore. Citizens can play a part by contributing under categories such as \"Sounds of the Heartlands\" and \"Festivals and Celebrations\".Anchored by our past, we can face the future with confidence. To bring Singapore forward, Minister Iswaran said all citizens should feel confident about seizing digital opportunities. Mr Chairman, in Mandarin, please.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Digitalisation has disrupted industries, transforming jobs and creating new ones. Companies in Singapore are innovating more. The demand for high-skilled roles is set to grow. This will create new opportunities for the workforce in roles such as product managers, data scientists and software engineers.We must support all workers in skills transition. One segment the Government is focusing on is mid-career professionals. With digitalisation creating disruption alongside opportunities, this group of professionals may face challenges in career transitions. However, their rich experience makes them invaluable to the economy.The TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) programme supports workers to acquire new ICT skills.50-year-old Mr Tan Wai Chong worked in the IT field for 25 years. He has always been interested to learn new skills. With structured training from PSA through TeSA’s Company-Led Training programme, he took on an advanced tech role. He is now an Application Developer with PSA.To support more mid-career professionals like Mr Tan, IMDA is launching the TeSA Mid-Career Advance programme for Singaporeans aged 40 and above.The programme will comprise training and mentorship of up to 24 months to equip mid-career professionals with competencies for in-demand tech roles. For a start, about 10 companies have come on board, and committed to about 500 training placements. IMDA aims to benefit an additional 2,000 mid-career professionals over the next two to three years.Together with the industry, we will support these professionals to further their careers with confidence.(In English): Chairman, back to English. Technology can empower our people. However, some segments of the population, such as seniors and low-income households, may feel lost in the digital society. They may struggle to catch up. I understand their anxiety.Singapore must therefore focus on digital inclusion. We must overcome age, income and literacy gaps, so everyone can reap the benefits of the digital economy.Mr Vikram Nair asked about measures to boost digital readiness, while Dr Teo Ho Pin asked how we are improving digital access for low-income households and seniors.NLB and IMDA are galvanising the community and industry to build digital literacy and skills. This is in sync with the Singapore Together movement, where the Government partners with Singaporeans to build a better future.To support low-income Singaporeans, the Home Access Programme has subsidised broadband for over 14,000 households. One of the beneficiaries is Mr D Rashpal Singh Sidhu. With subsidised broadband, Mr Sidhu found a part-time job after searching online. He also uses the Internet to stay in touch with overseas relatives.However, while household broadband access in Singapore has increased over the years, some low-income households are still unconnected. To benefit more low-income households, IMDA will enhance the Home Access Programme from April. IMDA will partner with M1, MyRepublic Limited and NetLink Trust to defray thecost of broadband for low-income households, while offering faster broadband speeds. IMDA will also offer a wider range of devices, giving households the choice of either a subsidised smartphone or tablet. We aim to benefit 10,000 more low-income households over three years.We are also helping seniors to learn digital skills. IMDA, together with partners such as NLB, organised over 200 free Digital Clinics in libraries and community spaces to help seniors with their smartphone devices. Some 3,000 volunteers have reached out to over 15,000 seniors island-wide. One of these seniors is 64-year-old Madam Safia Bte Mohd Salleh. Through Digital Clinics, she discovered useful apps to make polyclinic and hospital appointments, and check the arrival times of buses. She plans to visit Digital Clinics again to learn more.There are also ground-up efforts to help children navigate the online environment safely. This is important as they are increasingly exposed to technology from an early age. The Media Literacy Council is partnering Google to bring a mobile interactive exhibition on online safety to primary schools this year. Students can learn about online safety, cyber-bullying and the actions to take when encountering problems online. Our Singapore Fund for Digital Readiness also supports community efforts to combat online risks. For example, a group of NTU students organised an exhibition to raise awareness of online child grooming. Visitors could step into the shoes of victims through interactive installations. I visited the exhibition last week. It was very well done, and the messages hit home. I applaud the strong contributions of the community to promote online safety.Our march towards the digital future must also be matched by an unwavering sense of community. In the fast-moving digital world, it is more important than ever to connect people through common spaces and programmes.Our libraries play a key role in this. They have transformed over the years to become trusted and treasured spaces where people can bond, socialise and learn.Mr Cedric Foo asked how we are revamping libraries to ensure they stay relevant in a digital world. We have revamped six libraries under the Libraries of the Future initiative. Strong community engagement to encourage lifelong learning is the hallmark of these libraries. For example, at library@harbourfront, which opened last year, citizens young and old can learn about emerging technology at The Tech Showcase. Interactive displays on topics like educational robotics offer an engaging learning experience. Families can also participate in hands-on activities at the children's makerspace. The revamped libraries have seen an increase of 73% in total visitors and 49% in total loans in the first year of operation. Our libraries are an exception to the global trend of falling library usage.We are continuing our libraries' transformation. NLB will revamp eight more libraries from now to 2026. They include Choa Chu Kang Public Library, Central Public Library, Queenstown Public Library and Marine Parade Public Library. In addition to these, a brand new Punggol Regional Library is in the works.These future libraries will play a stronger role in connecting Singaporeans. They will build inclusive learning communities. For example, Punggol Regional Library will offer spaces and collections for all age groups and needs. Users with disabilities and children with special needs can enjoy customised services. The library will also house a specially curated world children’s literature collection so younger Singaporeans can appreciate cultural diversity from an early age.Mr Chairman, the digital future presents endless possibilities. MCI will persevere in our efforts to ensure every business, worker and citizen can seize digital opportunities. We will continue to nurture enduring partnerships to realise this vision, and leave no one behind. Let us work together, as one nation, to forge a strong digital future.The Chairman: Clarifications. Mr Irshad.Mr Mohamed Irshad: Mr Chairman, I welcome the deployment of the thousand lockers across Singapore, particularly to have it located within five minutes of the HDB block. Just one clarification for the Senior Minister of State. She mentioned the roll-out of the locker network will be overseen and managed by IMDA. Can the Ministry study the possibility of setting up a new unit or an entity under either MCI or MOT, similar to Home Team Science and Technology Agency or HTX under MHA. This entity will then have a clear mandate focusing on digitising and driving innovation and transformation in the post, parcel and logistic industry in Singapore by setting relevant standards trialing and driving adoption of new innovative technology such as, say, drone delivery and blockchain traceablility?Ms Sim Ann: I thank Mr Ishad for his question. Within IMDA, in fact, there is already a sector transformation group whose work is to support the digitalisation as well as transformation of different industry sectors. Urban Logistics is one of them and the Nationwide Parcel Locker Network that we talked about is one of the initiatives under this particular sector.The Chairman: Mr Cedric Foo.Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng: Chairman, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State, Ms Sim Ann, whether or not we can confidently say that no child in a Singapore school will be without a computer and broadband access if their family cannot afford one.Ms Sim Ann: To answer Mr Cedric Foo's question, this is, I think, a very important goal to ensure that every child in Singapore is able to learn well and is able to make the full use of the benefits of digital learning. This is a goal shared by MCI as well as MOE. We will do our part in terms of ensuring that low-income households are able to have home access and also at the same time we do partner MOE to also ensure that at the school level, every child who needs digital devices or computers is also being served.1.45 pmThe Chairman: Mr Irshad.Mr Mohamed Irshad: Just one other clarification. I welcome the move to set up gov.sg WhatsApp group, a WhatsApp channel to communicate with the public. At which point does MCI determine which channel to communicate with, for example, there is also Telegram. So, what were the considerations behind choosing which platform as a third party platform to communicate with the public?Mr S Iswaran: Chairman, I thank the Member for his question. As I said earlier, we have to choose the channel according to both the target segment that we want to reach out to but also in terms of our ability to respond situationally. In this case, the COVID-19 outbreak occurred very quickly, we sensed that there is going to be an immediate need for a reliable source of information for our population. What we then did was to repurpose an existing channel, which was a WhatsApp channel that was already available – that was used for communication for certain types of information, particularly the Merdeka Generation package and related information – and we decided that we would repurpose it and make that an immediate mechanism by which we convey the requisite – the relevant information to our population.I think it has worked well, as evidenced by the response that we have seen from the subscribers, but we do not preclude the possibility of using other channels. But this was responding to an immediate need with the tool that was available to us with the shortest possible notice.Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng: Chairman, some months ago, we had a healthy discussion between Mr Pritam Singh and myself about POFMA; whether the Judiciary is best party to act, or whether the Executive branch is better placed to act on the issuance of Correction Notices. I think the recent COVID-19 outbreak is a good example of when to use POFMA. From the recent experience using POFMA for this purpose, does the Minister feel even stronger now, that this is a job best left for the Executive branch?Mr S Iswaran: Chairman, I thank the Member, who is the Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee, for his comment. As I emphasised, I think what COVID-19 has in particular brought to the fore, is the need for swift action, when you are trying to ensure a falsehood does not gain traction and mislead the population. In a situation like an epidemic, it is essential that our population stays calm, gets advice and information from reliable sources, and is able to then take appropriate measures.In that context, we have found POFMA, the tools and also the ability to exercise those tools, the authority that is vested in the Executive to exercise those tools, to have been very effective. It has, I think, demonstrated the case that we made in the course of the debate, in introducing the legislation, that one of the reasons, not the only, but a key reason for wanting to site that authority with the Executive arm, was to ensure the ability to respond decisively, swiftly given the virulence and virality of falsehoods that are pervade online. I think our COVID-19 experience has reinforced, if anything, that conviction; and certainly, we have no reason to question the reasons for doing so.The Chairman: Mr Pritam Singh.Mr Pritam Singh: Mr Chairman, thank you. I do not mean to open the debate that we had on POFMA again but the position as far as the Workers' Party is concerned, is still the same. Indeed, you have instances of fake news in the case of epidemics, even pandemics; certainly, they have to be taken down swiftly. But there are different modalities that swift action can manifest itself in. And the Workers' Party position is that there are still other options, apart from Executive orders, that can eventuate in that outcome.Mr Vikram Nair: Chairman. One of the points I mentioned was I think POFMA is very useful in handling online falsehoods. But, I think in the COVID-19 situation, one of the things we realised, a lot of the falsehoods spread through messaging apps such as WhatsApp for which the Correction Orders in POFMA would not work effectively. So, is there anything else we can do about that? Either future legislation or what I had suggested was, better education of the population.Mr S Iswaran: Mr Chairman, without wanting to prolong that discussion on POFMA, let me just say that, I think, essentially this is one of the reasons why we were very keen to move on the gov.sg WhatsApp service. Because, firstly, if it succeeded in terms of its reach to a large base of the population, it meant that they had a reliable source of information on COVID-19 through a channel that they are already quite accustomed to using. Secondly, if you were to receive such information reliably through WhatsApp, in this case, then there is also the ability for individuals who might encounter other sorts of information through other chat groups that they belong to, individuals can then forward this to basically provide the countervailing point of view. So, we think that that is a good start.In terms of the actual mechanisms for dealing with platforms like WhatsApp because they have end-to-end encryption and so they pose a different kind of challenge in terms of the POFMA regulation compared to some of the other platforms.As we said during the POFMA debate, we are taking an approach which takes into account the variations across different platforms and that includes WhatsApp and Facebook whom we are engaging in an on-going discussion.The Chairman: Mr Cedric Foo, would you like to withdraw your amendment, please?Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng: Chairman, indeed digital technology will be a key enabler for a brighter future for Singapore. Listening to Senior Minister of State, Ms Sim Ann, Senior Minister of State, Dr Janil and Minister Iswaran, I am sure my colleagues share my view that we are in good hands. That is because they do not only talk about technology and digits, they were talking about people. Chairman, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $1,004,918,400 for Head Q ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $37,103,300 for Head Q ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates."

        "Content": "10.40 amThe Fight against New and Emerging ThreatsMr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah): Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head P of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".The Home Team plays an important role in keeping Singapore safe from terror threats. Last year, two Singaporeans were charged with terrorism financing, transmitting money to fund terrorist causes overseas. Our TransCom officers conduct high-visibility patrols at bus interchanges and MRT stations. In 2018 alone, they made 723 arrests, with most offenders possessing dangerous weapons and drugs.Not just called upon in day-to-day operations to keep Singaporeans safe, the Home Team also does an excellent job during times of heightened security risks such as hosting of key international meetings. In 2018, we hosted the Trump-Kim summit and the 33rd ASEAN Summit. In 2019, we hosted the signing of the Singapore Convention on Mediation which required large scale operations to protect the many dignitaries from different countries and to maintain law and order during the large scale event.The changing global landscape of crime and crime-related activities have an impact on Singapore. Through the Internet, crime is no longer confined to the physical territorial boundaries of a country and much harm can be done by a person even without stepping onto our shores. The Home Team has proven itself as a formidable force – having to deal with the global threat of terrorism and its implications on Singapore; increasing recreational drug use in the region and the world; and having to deal with the ensuring of law and order for multiple high-key international events hosted in Singapore. There is also the threat of foreign interference in our domestic politics. There is also the threat which fake news can pose on on-going security operations conducted by the Home Team. In fact, when fake news is bandied around on WhatsApp, during very important security operations by the Home Team, it does impact the operational ability of that exercise and that operation.This list of threats stands to get longer as the world becomes smaller. Consequently, the threats become closer.The Home Team can remain effective and operational notwithstanding these pressures. For example, our Home Team can leverage on science and technology, intelligence gathering, cooperation with other enforcement agencies, predicting future threats early and recruiting dedicated officers. Would the Minister elaborate on how the Home Team is leveraging on each of these aspects to ensure it continues to safeguard Singapore from new and emerging threats in addition to its important everyday functions of maintaining law and order?Question proposed.The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza.SPF 200 – Continuing ExcellenceMr Christopher de Souza: Thank you, Mr Chairman. My next cut, the SPF 200 Exhibition \"Frontier Town to Safest City\" captured the essence of SPF's remarkable journey from a 12-man team to a formidable and effective force of 15,000 today. As Minister Shanmugam said at the launch of the exhibition, over the years, the Singapore Police Force has had to deal with the relevant threats of the times – opium, gambling, secret societies, prostitution, conflicts and unrest between different groups. The security landscape has changed in those 200 years, but the Police Force’s values and mission remain the same – integrity in maintaining law and order. It is only right that in the course of this year’sCOSdebate that we use the opportunity to thank the dedicated officers of our Singapore Police Force for their professionalism and readiness to protect law and order in Singapore.10.45 amIt is only right that in the course of this year'sCOSdebate that we use the opportunity to thank the dedicated officers of our Singapore Police Force for their professionalism and readiness to protect law and order in Singapore. Looking ahead, in today’s fast-changing security landscape, would the Minister share how the Home Team would transform to ensure that it continues its relevance, operational-readiness and efficiency?Managing Security Risks such as RiotsNext cut. Recently, we have seen a proliferation of large-scale chaos and riots in other countries. These have caused immense damage and disruption to essential services in those societies. In fact, Maplecroft, a company that specialises in global risk data and country risk analysis, estimated that nearly 40% of the world’s 195 countries will see civil unrest during 2020. How can our Home Team guard Singapore and its essential services against such dangerous security risks?Security Operations Surrounding COVID-19Next cut. Over and above its everyday duties to keep law and order in Singapore, the Home Team has stepped up to the plate to ensure many quarantine centres are manned and protected and contact tracing carried out effectively. My question is: would the Minister provide an update on the deployment of our Home Team officers towards the national fight against COVID-19 and whether we can build a precedent or a standard operating procedure (SOP) arising from current operational experiences that officers can refer to in a future outbreak?Public TrustMr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol): Mr Chairman, growing up in the 1970s and 1980s, the Police was some sort of a mystic, so there is a mysterious part to the Police Force. When I was growing up in a Teochew kampung, my parents always say \"mata liak\" or Police will catch you, if you are not doing the right things. So, you have some fear but that transformed later on in school. When we went for a road safety campaign and we saw the policemen teaching us how to obey the safety rules, traffic rules and they were extremely friendly. So, it changed my perception that the engagement between the public and the Police was friendly, and you can have a lot of confidence and trust in them.In the latest Gallup poll, 94% of the residents or Singaporeans felt very safe to walk around the neighbourhood at night, and we were ranked first in the whole Global Order Index. We were also ranked first in Order and Security in the world. So, that is no mean feat because as I became a Member of Parliament, and I dealt with Sengkang NPC, every single one of the policemen, when they engage the public, that friendliness and confidence is there and you can tell that the public trusts them, so much so that even the smallest of things they would send a complaint or report to the policeman. That makes them really, really \"see eh boh eng\", very busy.As we made progress, I realised it is more and more difficult to maintain that public trust for our policemen, especially when there is social media. The social media, with its fake news or real news or even pictures. A picture, although it speaks a thousand words, but then again, if it is the wrong caption, then it would actually affect the trust and confidence in the policemen.So, in this day and age, with the world changing really fast, and with social media and information overload, how is the SPF or how is the Ministry going to maintain that public trust and confidence in our Police Force? Moving forward, what are the measures and also plans that they will Implement and execute in order to uphold that trust? Because with that trust, then our enforcement officers can do their work and we can still continue to be ranked number one in the Global Order Index.Security NeedsMiss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines): Sir, the hardworking men and women of the Home Team have played a critical role in keeping our country and our people safe. With new challenges emerging, their work gets tougher. I am heartened that the Home Team has transformed its operations throughout the years.With the celebration of Singapore Police Force's 200th Anniversary this year, can the Minister share how does our Home Team remain relevant to meet our evolving security needs?Home Team CapabilityMr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio): Chairman, the recent Hong Kong protests had shown how quickly mass gatherings can degenerate into chaos, resulting in injuries and even deaths, and damage to properties. Such incidents not only destabilise communities, they also cause social rifts and hurt the economy.I understand that recently, the Police had to be called in to help manage the crowds in at least one of the supermarkets after the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) was raised to Orange. While this is a very different situation from Hong Kong, it shows that unexpected events can lead to people gathering and the Home Team must always be on the ready to ensure order.Would the Ministry share what lessons we have learnt from the Hong Kong protests and how would the Home Team prevent similar incidents from happening in Singapore?Residency for Transnational SpousesAssoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, transnational families form a significant proportion of our population today. Between 2009 and 2015, around 15,000 citizen children were born to non-resident foreign mothers. In 2018, one in four citizen marriages involved a non-resident.Such families often live with tremendous uncertainty because the foreign spouse must continuously apply for the right to stay in Singapore. ICA does not publicly disclose the exact criteria for granting or renewing a visit pass. Foreign spouses are placed in a vulnerable position within their marriage because of this uncertainty. Community organisations who work with abuse survivors or migrants have seen many cases of the citizen spouse threatening to cancel their pass as a way to abuse their foreign wives.Transnational families, particularly lower income ones, also have limited housing options. Citizens can purchase HDB flats but they are treated as singles for housing grants and foreign spouses cannot be co-owners.In cases of divorce or widowhood, the foreign spouse faces even more uncertainty. The Government has said it will help facilitate a renewable LTVP, as long as they have custody over young Singaporean children. This is very welcome but not a guarantee. The foreign spouse also has no right to occupy or inherit an HDB flat, causing great anxiety over housing. Can the Government allow citizens married to LTVP+ holders to qualify as a family for the Public Rental Scheme?Can the Government provide greater support and protection to these vulnerable families by granting the LTVP+ to all foreign spouses of citizens? Can the Government consider creating a clear, timed pathway for these foreign spouses to obtain Permanent Residence status?Home Team Science and Technology AgencyMr Christopher de Souza: Thank you, Chairman. Leveraging on science and technology will aid our Home Team officers in ensuring we have the capability to deter, fend off and overcome new threats. Technology has the benefit of allowing officers to perform critical roles with greater time and focus. Would the Minister please provide us an update on how the Science and Technology Agency (HTX) will enhance our Home Team’s fight against new and emerging threats?The Chairman: Ms Jessica Tan. Both cuts, thank you.Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast): Mr Chairman, with the formation of the Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) with responsibility in research and procurement areas of border security and protection of critical infrastructures, what are the areas of focus in its technology roadmap? How will the work of HTX help in operational effectiveness of the Home Team?HTX has ambitious goals. Having the right talent and skills is critical for the success of the HTC. Could the Minister share more on HTX’s talent strategy? Has HTX been successful in attracting the right talent it requires for the scale and scope of its ambitious mandate? Could the Minister also share the profile of the HTX team?One of HTX's people strategy is to enable integration across the Home Team to bring together capabilities, knowledge and resources from different Home Team Departments. How has HTX brought together the capabilities across the different Home Team Departments? Does HTX have the right talents who are able to translate security operational requirements into technology solutions and what are some of these solutions?As HTX is a new organisation, what are the early challenges it is facing? What are the risks involved in the use of technology in the Home Team's operations and how is the Home Team addressing these risks?Its work in security technologies and research as well as the prevention, response and recovery from cyber attacks requires inter-agency coordination and industry partnerships. How is the Home Team developing HTX's inter-agency cooperation and industry collaborations?Strengthening Home Team CapabilityMy next cut. In keeping Singapore safe and secure, the Home Team has to tackle an increasing complex security environment and at most times the problem to be solved is not always defined or predictable.Operationally, officers have to deal with vast information, complex and fast evolving situations and manage risks. In such an environment, could the Minister share the Home Team’s approach to skills and capability building of its officers? How does the Home Team track the effectiveness of these capability development programmes? With the pace of change, how does the Home Team’s capability development programmes enable continual learning?Technology continues to play an increasing role in homeland security and the environment that officers have to deal with range from the physical to cyber. How does the Home Team ensure that its officers are adequately prepared and equipped to adapt and leverage new technologies and solutions to effectively deploy them in their operations?Technology in the Home TeamMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast): The Home Team must now operate within the confines of many unknowns and some of these crimes and threats cut across continents and boundaries, both physically and virtually.In the same vein, the workforce profile in Singapore is changing rapidly and with an extremely tight labour market, an ageing workforce and imminent negative employment growth in a few years’ time, against this backdrop, how will the Home Team leverage technology to mitigate emerging threats and manpower constraints?As the Home Team increases leverage of technology in its operations, how does the Home Team ensure its officers are adequately prepared and equipped to adapt to the rapid transformation?In addition, I applaud the SPF's deployment of the PolCam. Can I ask for an update on PolCam deployment and effectiveness? At the same time, can I ask SPF for more PolCams to be deployed in congregation points across Boon Lay to better prevent and detect crimes?Regulating E-gamingMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member): In a 2019 global survey, it was found that Singaporean gamers spend more time playing electronic games than other Asian counterparts. Loot boxes, a consumable virtual item used to redeem a randomised selection of further virtual items, is increasingly seen in some quarters as a form of gambling. A study by academics at the University of York indicated that micro-transactions are rising as well. In many games, these are to purchase loot boxes. From a separate study by academics in York, there is some evidence linking loot boxes to problem gambling.Based on a Parliamentary Question I asked in January last year, MHA is studying the matter. Belgium has banned loot boxes purchased using real money. The UK National Health Service has also called for the industry to ban loot boxes. Its Mental Health Director Claire Murdoch warned that these were in danger of \"setting kids up for addiction\".Singapore ought to consider implementing, at the very least, regulations to limit access to micro-transaction-driven loot boxes by youth, so as to prevent habituation to addictive gambling-like behaviour among young gamers.Raising of Retirement AgeMr Desmond Choo (Tampines): Law enforcement has evolved over the years. It used to be physical patrolling. But now that crimes are more sophisticated and complex, it requires more mental dexterity and experience. At the same time, manpower constraints have gotten more severe with declining birth rates. We need a larger better-equipped and skilled Home Team to deal with the challenges of today and tomorrow.Therefore, it is timely we extend the retirement and re-employment age of our police officers. I have had the privilege of serving with them for 13 years. I still meet many of them even now. They have adapted well to the changing enforcement landscape and equipped themselves with new skills. They have also kept themselves healthier. Some of the senior ones have gone into mentorship roles. Indeed, they are really craftsmen. They polish their craft and master it over time. Then, they guide younger officers to do even better.Can we extend the retirement age of our officers from 55 years old to 62 years old, and re-employment age to 65 years old? Optional early retirement could still be offered at age 55, if they prefer. Officers should also be offered an Employment Assistance Package if they are found unsuitable for re-employment. Establishing a second career can be difficult and we should help our officers to tide over a difficult period upon retirement after they invested most of their lives in the Police Force.I understand the operational difficulties of a significant jump in retirement age. Thus, we should do this in phases. Extending the retirement and re-employment age will not only allow the Home Team to retain talent to meet growing security challenges but also buttress our longer term crime-fighting strategies.We must also ensure that we continue to invest in technology to help our officers combat crimes more effectively. Can the Minister share how we have been using technology to mitigate against emerging threats and manpower challenges?11.00 amPublic Education Programmes on DrugsMs Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong): Chairman, in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]I watched Senior Parliamentary Secretary Amrin Amin's efforts to engage the Malay/Muslim community to spread the anti-drug message through the Dadah Itu Haram campaign. This campaign brings a deeper understanding about the efforts by the Government and the community in the fight against drugs. I also see this campaign as a good opportunity to create awareness about the challenges faced by ex-addicts. This can encourage efforts to help addicts recover, turn over a new leaf and give back to society. It seems that many people are now aware of this campaign and understand the important messages that it wants to send.May I ask, apart from the increasing awareness, what are the other positive outcomes arising from this wonderful endeavour? Will other plans be implemented to build on the current efforts?(In English):Chairman, in English. I have seen the efforts to reach out to the Malay/Muslim community through the Dadah Itu Haram campaign. There is clearly great value in taking a targeted approach and doing a community-specific engagement. By understanding the values within the community, the messages in the outreach efforts can be made more nuanced and would therefore have more impact to the people within the community.However, has the Ministry carried out an assessment on the effectiveness of the community-specific public engagement approach in raising awareness and curbing drug abuse? Has such targeted approach resulted in better outcomes, especially in relation to reducing the numbers of addicts within the specific community or curbing the negative effects of drugs in the community? If such efforts have been showing results, are there upcoming plans to increase community-specific public education programmes?Community Efforts against DrugsThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim): Mr Chairman, I thank the Ministry for the various outreach efforts on drug abuse and community involvements to protect our people from drug abuse and rehabilitate the offenders and help their families.Among these efforts are those targeted at the Malay/Muslim community. Can MHA provide an update on the on-going efforts to engage the Malay/Muslim community with regards to drug abuse and whether there are other programmes or initiatives in the pipeline?Drugs and YouthMr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir): Mr Chairman, I believe the issue of drug abuse among our youths in Singapore is an important matter for our Government to address. The potential damage and detrimental effects that drug abusers cause themselves, their families and the wider Singaporean Community can be significant.This has been the cornerstone of our drug abuse policy in Singapore and I believe that the majority of Singaporeans strongly support the Government’s tough stance against drug abuse over the years. The recent statistics for 2019 released by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), however, suggests that we continue to have a worrying trend in Singapore. This is especially so when it is about new and young drug abusers.The total number of new drug abusers arrested in 2019 increased by 8% from 2018. Of the 1,469 new drug abusers who were arrested in 2019, about 61% were below 30 years old. Drug abusers in the 20 to 29 years old age group continue to form the largest group of abusers in 2019.One of the reasons for this worrying trend could because our youths are being influenced by misinformation, especially in relation, to what some deem as \"less harmful soft drugs\". Because of this, some of our youths may then adopt a more liberal attitude towards the use of drugs.Sir, this is a trend that we must arrest. I invite the Minister to share with this House further details of the Ministry's plans on changing the drug narrative that influences our youths and to reduce the number of youths involved in the consumption of drugs.Drug Abuse among Youths in SingaporeMr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, this cut concerns the topic of drug abuse among our youths. Over the last two years, this House has continually affirmed our nation's zero-tolerance effort approach toward drugs. Together, this House has passed legislation making it an offence to knowingly or recklessly leave the drugs or drug utensils within easy access of a child.Despite these efforts Mr Chairman, legislation alone will not solve our drug problem. Sir, it is not difficult to see the persistent glamorisation and normalisation of drug use through online media. Our young people would not even flinch from to use a hashtag like \"#420\". Indeed, last year, the highest number of new drug users were those aged under 35. In this context, I raise three questions about the Ministry's preventive drug education efforts.First, MHA informed the house earlier this month that CNB has been developing social media content and messages highlighting \"strong deterrence\" and \"evidence-based narratives\" on Singapore's drug policies. Can MHA update this House on the progress of this programme. Second, outside the use of social media campaigns, are there current programmes launched by CNB to discourage youth consumption of drugs effective in deglamorising the consumption of drug use? What evidence do we have of its effectiveness? Lastly, what efforts are being under-taken by CNB to work with high-risk communities, like the LGBTQIA Community, to discourage drug use.Drugs–Tough Stance against SupplyMr Christopher de Souza: In order to keep up the fight against drugs, we should deter both its supply and demand. Drug trafficking harms many individuals.Where possible, the CNB should regularly broadcast data of how many drug abusers would be fed with the quantum of drugs found on a suspected drug trafficker. This will enable the many, who are following the global drug debate to have a clear and accurate understanding as to the immense destruction that drug trafficking causes to human beings, families and children. This will also provide the rationale behind why we, in Parliament, take strong positions against drug trafficking in and through Singapore and the consumption of drugs on our shores.Drugs–Deterring Cannabis UseMr Christopher de Souza: My next cut, also on drugs. A number of countries have legalised the consumption of cannabis. An increasing number of cannabis abusers worldwide is concerning.What are plans to keep Singapore free from the scourge of cannabis abuse, especially given the mental and physical ill-effects of cannabis use and its dangerous characteristic as a gateway to harder and more deadly drugs?Drugs–Battling Psychoactive SubstancesMr Christopher de Souza: Next cut on drugs. Syndicates and criminal outfits are concocting new psychoactive substances at a fast pace. This is a continuing threat. The substances are finding their way into markets around the region. CNB is staffed with dedicated and professional officers – it should be ahead of the game by detecting New Psychoactive Substances (NPSes) early. Also, the regime under the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) should be quick enough to classify newly concocted NPSes as illegal, thereby adding an extra legal deterrent effect.Prisons–Enhancing Rehabilitation of Drug AddictsMr Christopher de Souza: My last cut on drugs, Sir. The Singapore Prisons Service plays an important role in helping criminals have a second chance in society through supporting the inmate's rehabilitation and reintegration into society. Aided by the amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act in 2019, the Prisons Service has been able to further differentiate offenders risks of reoffending, reduce lower risk offenders from being negatively influenced by more recalcitrant offenders and better support drug offenders in a way that is calibrated to their situation.Would the Minister provide an update, on how and whether this better calibration has reduced the inmates' risks of re-offending.Rehabilitating and Reintegrating InmatesMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok): Sir, let me start off by acknowledging the good work that MHA, Singapore Prison Service (SPS), SCORE and the partners of The Community Action for the Rehabilitation of Ex-Offenders (CARE) Network have done to rehabilitate offenders and reintegrate them back into the society.It is important to remind ourselves of the policy underpinning MHA's efforts on this front. Senior Minister Teo Chee Hian in a written reply issued in 2012 to a Parliamentary Question (PQ) stated as follows: \"Effective rehabilitation and successful reintegration of offenders back into society contribute to a safer Singapore\". This is however, not an easy objective to achieve.Minister for Home Affairs, Mr K Shanmugam, acknowledged this in a speech he made on 28 June 2019 to the partners of the CARE Network. He observed that whilst the recividism rate over two years went down by half in the last 20 years, nearly one in two ex-offenders returned to prison five years after their release.In the recent past, there have been several structural changes implemented by this House to allow for better rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. I will name two. The widening of community sentencing options for offenders and the revamp of the Reformative Training regime.I also note that SPF has also implemented other measures such as increasing access to counsellors, providing better opportunities for education and skills training and imposing Mandatory Aftercare Scheme for ex-offenders assessed to have a higher risk of re-offending. It has also leveraged on technology to foster closer relations between inmates and their family members as part of the rehabilitation process; for example, by allowing inmates to correspond with their family members through the e-letters system.It is timely, therefore, to review how these important changes have contributed to the mission of lowering the recidivism rates amongst offenders, and identify what further steps can be taken, not just by MHA but rest of society, to achieve the objective of making Singapore safer. I would be grateful for an update, please.Emergency Medical Services (EMS) CallsMr Sitoh Yih Pin: Mr Chairman, the SCDF responded to 191,468 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) calls in 2019 – an average of 520 calls a day. The SCDF is an integral part of our frontline response team whenever Singaporeans encounter emergency medical situations in their everyday lives. Their jobs to put it mildly, is to respond quickly anywhere in Singapore and try to save the lives of Singaporeans in trouble.In fact, we can all see the tremendous work they do, day to day, as we continue to battle the COVID-19 virus outbreak in Singapore. I must, take time, to put on record our heart-felt appreciation to them and our medical healthcare team for their dedication and sacrifice in this on-going battle.Sir, we can see that the number of EMS calls have increased, year on year, since 1998. The 2019 figures showed a 2.1% increase from 2018. As each year passed, the SCDF EMS team has to deal with progressively larger volumes of medical emergency situations every day. We must, therefore, address this and support them in their work.However, a statistic that I found to be worrying in the Fire, Emergency Medical Services and Enforcement Statistics 2019 is that non-emergency and false alarm calls constitutes 9.2% of EMS calls. That means, almost 1 in every 10 calls is a non-emergency or a false alarm. Based on the statistics, the SCDF EMS team has to deal with almost 52 such calls every day. As we can imagine, such calls require the SCDF team to deploy resources which could otherwise have been dispatched to genuine life-threatening emergency cases.Sir, I understand that the SCDF is working hard to raise awareness between emergency and non-emergency calls through public education in a bid to bring down the numbers of such calls. This is part of their continuing efforts and constitutes a key strategy in bringing down the numbers of such calls.I therefore invite the Minister to share with this House, the long term plans and strategies on how the Home Team intends to ensure that the genuine emergency cases are attended to promptly and efficiently, especially in light of the resource constraints that the SCDF faces.11.15 amTraffic SummonsMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Sir, in April last year, the Ministry increased composition sums for a wide range of traffic offences in response to an uptrend in road traffic incidents generally. For example, the fines for illegal u-turns, while attracting zero demerit points, were raised from $70 to $100 while heavy vehicle drivers saw the composition sum for the same offence increased from $100 to $150. In fact, there was an increase in the composition fines for all offences that attracted fines up to 12 demerit points. For offences that attracted at least 12 demerit points which could manifest, for example, in a failure to conform to a red light signal, the composition fine has been doubled from $200 to $400 while heavy vehicle drivers have seen a jump in the same offence from $230 to $500 in so far as the fine amount is concerned.Sir, I agree that road safety is something we cannot compromise upon and the need for deterrence is obvious. However, many of the residents I see who are on the receiving end of these new fines admit to their offences and are usually contrite. In most cases, there is no question of actual harm caused – because that would attract more severe penalties anyway.Those most heavily affected by the higher fines are taxi and private-hire car drivers, motorcycle couriers and the low-income who may not have the ability to pay up such a large sum of money at one go.In the appropriate case, I would like to request the Ministry to consider the option of offering an automatic instalment plan for comparatively minor offences that do not attract a custodial sentence on the condition that the offender undertake not to commit a similar offence, failing which no instalment plan would be offered as of right. This approach seeks to retain the deterrence and policy objective of higher fines.Some jurisdictions around the world even offer to halve a fine provided it is paid forthwith. Such a proposal can be modified for better policy outcomes, for example, with a requirement for some retraining or refresher defensive driving courses. For first-time offenders only, I hope the Ministry can consider such alternatives that achieve the objective of increased road safety awareness and deterrence on the one hand and reasonable consideration for the financial consequences on frequent – usually low-income – road users on the other.Spam SMSes from Illegal SyndicatesMr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang): Chairman, I would like to bring up the issue of spam SMSes from illegal moneylenders and sports betting syndicates. I am sure I am not alone in this House to have received such SMSes. Back in September last year, I filed a Parliamentary Question to ask about the measures the agencies have taken to tackle this issue. I applaud the multi-agency effort between IMDA and SPF to counter spam SMSes.However, these syndicates are finding other ways to bypass our measures. Some have used overseas numbers to send WhatsApp messages containing local numbers to contact. There are also spam SMSes which are able to be sent out with their numbers masked, which made it more difficult to report or block such numbers.The official advice is for anyone receiving such spam SMSes to report to the SPF, either by a dedicated hotline or the i-Witness platform. I have looked at the platform online and I find it to be rather tedious and this may discourage reporting.Sir, I would like to suggest a more user-friendly method for reporting. Members of the public who receive such spam SMSes should be able to report simply by submitting a screenshot of the spam SMS directly to a designated number operated by IMDA and SPF. With more people reporting, I hope we would be in a better position to close down these syndicates.Public Safety–ScamsMs Jessica Tan Soon Neo: Mr Chairman, 2019 saw an increasing trend in the number of people falling prey to scams. This is concerning.The methods used by scammers range frome-commerce, loan, credit-for-sex, social media impersonation, Internet love scams, to investment scams. Scammers have even exploited the COVID-19 situation and impersonated as Government agents conducting contact tracing. The most recent scam is the fake email impersonation of President Halimah’s invitation for a dinner event with her, the Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet.While the elderly may be the target, a recent report indicates that six out of 10 persons that fall prey to scams in Singapore are persons aged 20-40 years of age. With high online usage in Singapore, it is not a surprise that online scams are increasing.What is the Home Team's strategy to protect Singaporeans and to mitigate the prevalence of these scams?Community Awareness of ScamsMs Rahayu Mahzam: The overall crime rate increased slightly last year mainly because of an increase in scams. This seems to be the trend for the past few years. Victims were cheated of at least $6.8 million in about 1,700 reported cases of loan scams between January and November last year. This is more than three times the reported amount for the whole of 2018, where there were about 990 cases and victims were cheated of a total of about $2 million.The number of people scammed by impersonators on social media also jumped by more than nine times in the past three years, with most victims being in their 20s to 40s. The number rose from 2017's 71 to 672 cases in the first 11 months of last year. The amount cheated increased nearly 43 times, from at least $168,000 to about $7.2 million over the same period of time. These figures are alarming.The Home Team has put in a lot of effort over the years to educate the public, including having anti-scam programmes for the elderly and \"Scamalert\". However, psychologically vulnerable people regardless of age and background continue to fall prey to scams and scammers are evolving to become more sophisticated. What is the Home Team’s strategy to mitigate the prevalence of scams?The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza. Take your cuts together.Deterring Online ScamsMr Christopher de Souza: Sir, the number of online and telephone scams is of concern. Besides online \"love\" scams and online shopping scams, concerns have been raised regarding the solicitation of donations through false representations. Such perpetrators tug on and exploit people’s altruistic intentions and they to rob them. In such situations, instead of leaving the victim to pursue civil recourse in the Courts, would it not be better to charge the perpetrator – assuming he can be identified – in Court under section 420 of the Penal Code, that is, for cheating? This would show that the state is taking the scams seriously. My next cut.Fight against Human TraffickingIn February 2020, two persons were sentenced to five and a half years' imprisonment for, amongst others, labour trafficking under the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act. Will the Minister share what can be done to tighten detection of potential human trafficking cases across the different types of trafficking, for example, labour and sex trafficking. How is Singapore working with enforcement agencies overseas to track and punish cross- border illicit trafficking syndicates? Next cut.Deterring Unlicensed MoneylendingHarassment at the hands of runners belonging to unlicensed moneylending syndicates is mentally and physically draining. The number of harassment cases related to unlicensed moneylending increased by 15% from 2018 to 2019. The majority of these cases were via electronic means but nonetheless harrowing. What are the plans of the Home Team to deter and reduce the incidences of such harassment? Last cut.Crisis Preparedness and CoordinationCrises can impact societies quickly. The impact can leave negative ill-effects or positive and lasting consequences of unity and common mission. During this COVID-19 crisis, how does the Home Team plan to garner community and public support in crisis preparedness and coordination such that Singapore society becomes stronger in the aftermath of a crisis?SG SecureMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan: Since we launched the SG Secure movement, can MHA share the progress of its outreach efforts, in particular, in the community as well as at workplaces? I urge MHA to work with the community and businesses to recruit SG Secure Ambassadors at every HDB block and at every workplace. These ambassadors can help spread the SG Secure message and be equipped with first aid, AED and CPR skills. This is so that in the event of a terrorist attack and, especially the day after, these ambassadors can also help to handle the community or workplace response, as well as to ensure that the community is able to deal with emerging threats to safety and security.In fact, although SG Secure aims to prepare for major contingencies, it has been helpful and useful for grassroots volunteers, community partners and stakeholders, including residents, to prepare for major incidents, just like the fire incident in Boon Lay which happened last year which confronted myself and my community.Community Support to Keep Singapore SafeThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng): Mr Chairman, the Home Team has continued to do well in keeping Singapore as a safe and secure home. As Mr Teo Ser Luck mentioned earlier, if we look at the international rankings, Singapore has been doing well and it is something we see not just in the rankings but also in the lived experience of our communities. Sometimes, on late-night walkabouts in Clementi town, which I help look after, I meet residents from different backgrounds and walks of life out and about at night on jalan-jalan, comfortable that even at night, it is alright to go out and walk around.But this effort to keep Singapore safe is never-ending. As the world changes, criminals have found new ways to reach into our communities and heartlands to reach into the lives and minds of our people.Today, I will speak on three challenges that the Home Team can hopefully continue to address even more in-depth and to a greater extent than before – terrorism, scams and drugs.On terrorism, Mr Chairman, Singapore has not experienced a terror attack in the past few years. But we must never take this for granted. Terrorism is a continuing threat to Singapore, as ISIS continues to attract many followers with their violent ideology. In January this year, a Singaporean man was charged with terrorist financing. Last month, in February, a 17-year-old Singaporean Secondary school student was detained for supporting ISIS.But it would be difficult, if not impossible, for MHA to fight terrorism alone. Potential threats may go undetected if the general population is not aware, not alert and not on the look-out. So, it is critical to engage our community and build awareness. Our entire nation and society are the frontlines against terrorism and, our defence, likewise, must be whole-of-society, whole-of-community, whole-of-nation. So, can the Minister share with us how will MHA be engaging the community at large to ensure that Singapore is well-prepared against the terrorism threat?Secondly, Mr Chairman, on scams, in particular, e-scams. Social media has created new ways for people to keep in touch, whether from halfway around the world or from halfway across our island. But it has also become a new channel for crime.Based on a report by Consumers International, the widespread use of social media has brought new opportunities for criminals to connect with consumers and commit fraud; and scammers devising new and more innovative ways to trick people out of their money or harvest their personal data.Scams have the potential to cause great harm to consumers and the financial losses can be potentially life-changing. When a scammer succeeds, people can lose an entire lifetime's worth of savings. And with electronic cash transfers, the misappropriated money can be in a different country within minutes of the scam, even before the victim has informed the authorities. This is a global problem and many of us know of fellow Singaporeans who have been affected, too.In 2019, Police statistics show that the total number of reported crimes increased by 6.3%, primarily due to a significant increase in scam cases. The total number of scam cases went up by 53% to 9,500 cases in 2019, up from 6,100 cases in 2018. A total of $168 million was lost to scammers last year in 2019. So, it is a worrying situation because, with each scam incident, someone has been deceived and lost his/her savings or harmed.I understand that MHA has been working hard to address this issue. In 2019, the Police set up the Anti-Scam Centre focusing on disrupting scammers’ operations and mitigating the monetary losses of victims by collaborating with financial institutions, telecommunication companies and digital platform owners. But I am sure more can be done.Furthermore, while the Police can work with institutions to deal with the situation, we must always remember that education is key, all the more so today because when scammers can reach out to people or our loved ones through mobile phones and instant messages, the additional safeguard of an informed and vigilant individual becomes more important than ever.11.30 amSo, the community needs to be made more aware of scams, to avoid falling prey to scammers and prevent loved ones from being tricked and misled as well. So, can the Minister share with us, how is MHA going to engage the community to help counter the increased threat of scams in our society?Mr Chairman, on Drug Abuse. Sir, as a Member of Parliament looking after a Constituency, as someone who has practised as a doctor, I have seen first-hand the damage that drugs can cause to families and to patients, to adults and the young. Drug addiction extracts hugecosts from the society. Thecosts of crime. Thecosts of lives poisoned and destroyed. Thecosts that sometimes cannot be measured in dollars and cents alone.An NTU study commissioned by MHA in 2016, looked at the quantitative aspects. They assessed that the totalcost of drug crime was as high as S$1.23 billion in 2015, even though our drug abuse rates are much lower than in other countries. But again, thecost is not just about dollars and cents. It is a humancost, acost in our people's lives.I understand that there was a local study on inter-generational offending. It is found that one in five inmates who are drug-abusing parents had children who had also committed crimes. The researches assessed that this was due to the exposure to similar risk factors and adverse childhood experiences.Sir, this is a humancost. It is acost that can affect and can devastate a family across more than one generation. It tells us that when drugs poison a family, it can poison not just the current generation, but affect the prospects of the next. The poison of drugs can contribute to avoidable, adverse outcomes. The poison of drugs can harm families. The poison of drugs can exacerbate inequality in a society.In Singapore, the proportion of new abusers in the past year remained high at 41%. And today, there is social media and mass media spreading misinformation that normalises drug use. And much of this content increasingly targeted at vulnerable youths, targeted at our next generation, targeted at our future.Other than tough drug laws and strict enforcement, can the Minister also tell us how MHA will engage the community to guard against the harms of drug abuse?The Chairman: Minister Shanmugam.The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam):Thank you, Sir. I thank the hon Members for their contributions and as usual, I will start by reviewing the year 2019, what has been done. Our primary mission is to keep Singapore safe and secure, a safe and secure home. If you look at international rankings, as well as more importantly, how our own people feel about their safety and security within Singapore, we do well. Looking at international rankings, the 2019 Gallup Global Law and Order Report, we are again, ranked first and that is the sixth year running that Singapore has been ranked number one.Our drug situation, something that I have spoken about quite frequently, Members have raised the point a number of times as well. It remains under control in Singapore. I think it is not something that you would ever say you won the fight. But the global situation, unfortunately, is getting worse with different regimes, a greater acceptance, a change in the legal position as well, where people are moving towards legalising in more and more countries, because they have lost the fight. Whereas in Singapore, almost uniquely, we have managed to hold our own within the country.If you look at fire safety, we again ranked first in the 2019 World Fires Statistics–it is the second year running. Moving on to our legislative calendar last year, I will touch on a couple of major aspects where we made legislative changes. First, we focused quite a bit on vulnerable victims and how we can protect them. So, the Penal Code was amended to cover more groups of vulnerable people, give them more protection, and enhanced the deterrence.To give one example, for offences committed against intimate partners or those in close relationships, we doubled the maximum penalties for rape, hurt, wrongful confinement. POHA–Protection from Harassment Act–was also amended. It allows victims of serious abuse who are in intimate relationships to get Protection Orders. In the past, only married women could get such Protection Orders under the Women's Charter and others had to rely on normal rules on criminal law assault. But we have given greater protection for those who are deemed to be in intimate partner relationships.Where people harass others whom they are in an intimate relationship with, the offender harasses someone who is in an intimate relationship, and there are repeated breaches of Protection Orders, punishments have been doubled. And if the perpetrator continues the harassment in breach of the Protection Orders, now, arrest is also possible. And the processes have been simplified so that victims can seek Protection Orders quickly.I have previously more than once commended the good work done by PAVE and organisations like PAVE. They provide legal and other counselling services to such victims, victims of Family Violence, who could be victims of intimate partner violence or who could be victims in a marriage situation, or in a marital situation. These organisations identify such individuals. Often, the individuals–I think Members of Parliament would have come across them–feel unable to leave the relationship. They find it very difficult. So, they need a lot of help, they need a lot of counselling. A number of NGOs are involved in it including, as I said, PAVE, to really take the steps that are needed to turn their lives around.In fact, PAVE's advocacy played a crucial role in informing and shaping the POHA amendments. They invited me to their Centre and shared with me what their clients go through. This was in August 2018. The stories were distressing. I listened to them. As I said, this was August 2018, and I told them we will do something. That really formed the basis of the amendments which we put through last year. So, it is a very good example of how civil society and Government can work together, to make real change on the ground.The second key area that we worked on last year was in dealing with preventing clashes from religious differences. These could be inter-religious as well as intra-religious. Our peace, our progress, our prosperity are all based on the social harmony that we have managed to foster in Singapore. And Members will know, worldwide, countries are struggling with identity politics and the fractured relationships between communities, and within communities in their respective countries.Our approach over the years, surveys, soundings, and I think Members' own interactions with the residents show that people overwhelmingly support the approach we have taken to emphasise on harmony, and to come down quite hard on people who try and use religion as a basis to create public and social discord.So, people overwhelmingly support our stand against divisive rhetoric, against using religion for political ends. And we have had the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA) now for 29 years, as of last year. I think the success of our policies is shown by the fact that we have never had to actually formally invoke the MRHA even once in those years.When it was first introduced, there was some disquiet. Several people said different things. I must count as one of those who was uncomfortable with the legislation. But we amended the MRHA last year in October and it will enable us to take effective, decisive action against the threats to religious harmony. And in a way, this framework actually has enhanced religious freedom within Singapore, because people of all religions–whatever your religious persuasion–feel confident, comfortable to go out there and practise their faiths. And if you agnostic, it is also the same. So, no one needs to feel uncomfortable in Singapore, because they know that there is a very protective framework that protects the freedom of religion.And that confidence is based on the fact that the authorities both have the power to take effective action and will take effective and swift action to threats against religious harmony.Among the amendments, we looked at our religious organisations. We do not want them to become channels or conduits for foreigners to channel their own agenda into Singapore or impose their values. We also put in various provisions to reduce conflicts, as I said not just between religions, but also within religion, intra-religion. And also we do not want religion to be used as a basis for attacking other groups who may not be of a religious persuasion.For example, say the LGBT community. During engagements with the LGBT groups, many of them have told us they felt targeted as a community. Meanwhile, religious groups also felt that they were targeted by LGBT groups. And our approach is, we put in something–whether religious groups target non-religious groups, or whether non-religious groups intend to target religious groups, both will be proscribed. People can go about their own lives. They should deal with their lives as they wish, but not use social or religious causes to attack each other.That comes from the position that every Singaporean has his/her place in Singapore. They must feel safe and we will take actions against anyone who threaten anyone else's physical safety. We should all be free to express our individual views but in a responsible manner. So, when we amended the MRHA, we explicitly stated that in the Explanatory Statement and used the LGBTQ community as an example of what would be covered by these provisions.That was a brief survey on our international rankings, our approach and the legislative changes. Let me now turn to the Home Team itself. I earlier spoke about how our people, Singaporeans, feel about the Home Team. Mr Teo Ser Luck spoke about the importance of maintaining public trust and effectiveness in the Home Team. That, to me, is fundamental, it is crucial.We can safely say year after year, I think the high level of confidence and trust that Singaporeans have in the Home Team is very clear.Surveys show that. I have referred to the surveys several times in this House–last year's surveys, public perception surveys–91% of respondents agreed that the Home Team is fulfilling its mission of keeping Singapore safe and secure.11.45 amNinety percent trusts Home Team officers to do their duties objectively and with integrity. In an SCDF survey, 99% were confident in SCDF's ability to cope with emergencies. In an SPF survey, 90% trust the SPF as an organisation and they all agree that the Police Force is well-respected in the community.And this trust is reflected in people's lived reality.If you look at the Global Law and Order Index by Gallup, which I referred to earlier, 94% of residents in Singapore feel safe walking home alone in their neighbourhoods at night, including women. That is more than any other place in the world. And if you were to look at the global average, that is 69%. Parents are confident of letting their young children take public transport home alone, or anywhere alone.We talk about freedoms. These freedoms are priceless – the freedom to be yourself, the freedom to let your children be children, the freedom to know that they can grow up safe and secure. These freedoms are priceless and they have come about because of our practical approach, our tough legal framework where we come down hard on offenders, and the fact that within that framework, a broad level of freedom for people to carry on with their lives, exists.Our people also trust the Home Team to manage incidents effectively. In our surveys, 89% of respondents are confident in the Home Team's ability to manage national crises.Talking about national crises, of course, we are dealing with COVID-19 now. Mr Christopher de Souza asked how have the Home Team officers been deployed in the national fight against the virus.Members would have seen from newspaper reports that Home Team officers, together with others from the agencies involved, have been working round the clock in dealing with COVID-19. Many of the officers are at the frontlines. If you look at the border control and health screening measures: at the checkpoints with hundreds of thousands of people coming in every day. Officers are also securing Government Quarantine Facilities and checking on persons under quarantine; supporting, quite crucially, MOH's contact-tracing operations: CID has lent its expertise, a team of officers. Their work has been reported fairly extensively and they have done quite exceptional work. The kind of contact-tracing that has been done is very detailed. I do not think you see a parallel anywhere else in the world.Home Team officers have also helped to conduct swabbing operations among suspect cases, which puts them on the frontline. They test for the virus. And for the second plane-load of Singaporeans that the Government flew back from Wuhan and also, of course, our officers helped convey suspect cases to hospital. That is the frontline.Non-frontline officers obviously are heavily involved. MHA is part of the multi-Ministry taskforce involved in the whole-of-Government response to the crisis. The Ministry also chairs the inter-agency Homefront Crisis Executive Group (HCEG) which supports the Ministerial taskforce to get the actions executed on the ground and ensure the smooth, coordinated, effective running of the crisis response operations. All of that, of course, comes on top of the officers' day-to-day responsibilities, which have to carry on.I have to say, I think I join many Singaporeans, and I am sure I join Members of Parliament, in saying that we are very proud of the way all our public officers have responded, including, if I may say Home Team officers. Thank you. [Applause.]Members will know that the Home Team, the Police Force and the rest of the Home Team, is actually very lean, like much of the Public Service. If you look at the ratio of Police officers to population: London is 0.34%; Hong Kong, 0.39%; New York City, 0.42%. Whereas we are 0.23%, including full-time National Servicemen. So, much leaner compared to any of these cities, but our outcomes are much better compared with any of them.And I think it comes from a combination of many years of a proper law and order framework, which went against international opinions sometimes. Secondly, the fact that our people have cooperated with that framework and have been strongly supportive. The fact that if you have committed a crime in Singapore, you are going to be prosecuted regardless of who you are. And if you are guilty or likely to be found guilty, and cases do not stretch for years and years and years, and punishment is therefore reasonably certain.These factors and the whole attitude that is supportive of our law and order framework, amongst a vast majority of our population, has meant that people who want to break the laws are a very small minority. That has allowed our taxpayer funds to be put to other uses and not the heavy policing that you see in many other countries. Yet, we still give the outcomes that people want in terms of safety and security, and how they feel about the country.Mr Christopher de Souza and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked how the Home Team can remain effective and operational in a changing environment. That requires continued heavy investment into the capabilities of the officers. We work with our partners to encourage our officers to engage in continuous learning and up-skilling, just like the rest of society, from recruitment to retirement.Mr Desmond Choo asked if retirement age for our Police officers will be raised. We will be increasing the retirement age gradually, not just Police officers, but officers under the Home Affairs Uniformed Services Scheme, from 55 years old currently to 58, by 2030. That will allow us to tap on the experience of our more mature officers. It will enhance career transition efforts and it will help them secure a meaningful second career after retiring from the Home Team.Let me touch a little bit on this. This year is a very important year for SPF. It is the SPF 200, as many Members would know. I am told that it was the first, if not, the second organisation that was set up in Singapore. If you go back to colonial times, understandably the British may have set up the Customs first before they set up the Police Force. Subject to that, in the 200 years, I think we have seen the Home Team grow from strength to strength. Miss Cheng Li Hui and Mr Christopher de Souza remarked about SPF's 200 years.If you go back to the early 19th century, we were a booming town but a booming immigrant town with more than its fair share of social ills – lawlessness, rampant piracy, clandestine activities between secret societies, riots between the different Chinese dialect groups. And there was really an urgent need for law and order. Major-General William Farquhar formed the first Police Force, with just 12 officers. They had to gear up quickly. By 1846, the first set of rules and regulations was established and they spelt out the duties, the way Police officers conduct themselves. They demarcated patrol sectors.We moved to a century later, in the 1900s, the Criminal Procedure Code and Criminal Registry Department were set up, and a fingerprint system was also set up and new Police buildings were constructed.Fast forward to after the Second World War, the \"999\" hotline was established and the Radio Division was established. Then, after the Maria Hertogh riots, the Riot Squad was set up.After 1965, Independence, the Police have taken on an even greater role in the safety and security of our society. The Police National Service was introduced in 1967 and the first Neighbourhood Police Post in 1983. That really transformed the image of the Police officer, not just as a person enforcing the law but also as a member of the community, out there in the community, helping people and responding to incidents.Then, we had September 11 incidents in New York and changed the operating landscape yet again – a new normal. We had to build counter-terrorism capabilities and put in place safety measures. I would say that, after the 2015 attacks in Paris, yet again, we had to step up considerably to look at the fact that a variety of soft targets could be attacked by terrorists.So, I think Members will agree with me, today, if we look at the SPF, it is a highly capable, professional Police Force and highly regarded. And I think our SPF officers deserve our recognition and appreciation for their professionalism, their readiness and sacrifice over the years. Thank you. [Applause.]This year, to better handle incidents in our coastal waters, PCG will be enhancing its capabilities. We will be getting new Fifth Generation PT class patrol boats. They will replace the Third Generation boats. And we will also get additional boats and that would be a significant upgrade to PCG's abilities to handle such incidents.I am confident that the Police Force, as a whole, will continue touphold the tradition of excellenceso that Singaporeans will continue to enjoy the very high levels of safety, security, law and order.Safety and security is not just the responsibility of law enforcers. I want to move away from the usualCOSspeech to say something a little bit more, philosophical, maybe even reflective. And this comes from some of the points made by Members of Parliament, including Mr Christopher de Souza, who questioned about the street protests that have taken place around the world. What are the lessons for us? Where do we go from here? Can it happen here?I think it comes back to this point. You can have the best Police Force in the world but you cannot deal with riots unless there are other things that are taken care of as well. We have had riots across the world – Chile, in Europe, in Hong Kong, of course, and other places. Street protests have escalated to violence. They have disrupted the lives of ordinary citizens, and destroyed public and private infrastructure. We have had in Lebanon, where several months of protests have caused a lot of damage. Santiago, I mentioned, demonstrators were enraged by hikes in public transport fares. They looted stores, and set fires to vehicles and properties. Then, we saw Hong Kong, seven months of protest. Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked what can we learn from these protests.I will take this opportunity to discuss Hong Kong and the others and what are the lessons for us.We have seen hundreds of thousands of people on the streets in Hong Kong. Some of them have engaged in extremely violent, disruptive behaviour, with the whole purpose of crippling the government and inflicting severe damage to the economy and to the reputation of the city, and obviously caused very severe challenges for the Hong Kong Police Force.Before this latest period of unrest, the Hong Kong Police Force was considered one of the finest in Asia. The Singapore Police Force and the Hong Kong Police Force, they were probably two very highly regarded Forces in Asia – disciplined, professional, well respected by local residents.12.00 pmBut since the protests started, the police have been caught between the need to uphold public order and protestors who resorted to increasingly violent tactics just to attack the police and instigate them. That, I would say, has severely damaged the relationship between the police and the public – not helped by the one-sided portrayal of the situation in the media. In particular, the international media often focused on criticising only the police force. The demonstrators were always called pro-democracy protestors; as for the police, there was always reference to their brutality, and their alleged brutal response. The first time a police officer fired a live round, the media depicted it as an example of police brutality, and the picture went round the world. But all the events leading up to that point were ignored.Protestors, as I said, were often portrayed in a positive light. That the police were being attacked, their lives were frequently in danger, their families were being exposed–all that was ignored. The protestors were not just violent towards the Police. Hong Kong residents who went to try and clean up were set upon by the protestors. In one instance, a man was hit over the head with a drain cover by masked assailants while clearing the roadblocks.Today, just before the COVID-19 situation, the Hong Kong police force were seriously stretched. They faced persistent criticism both domestically and internationally. Even when they were off-duty, they have had to fend off protestors targeting their family and loved ones. Morale was obviously affected.So, what are the lessons for us? I think one key lesson is the actions of disaffected few, should not be allowed to threaten the rights of the majority to live in a stable, peaceful society. And, really, there has to be a zero-tolerance approach to illegal demonstrations and protests. We already have the Public Order Act. We take a zero-tolerance approach. So, it is an offence to organise or participate in a public assembly in Singapore without a Police permit. Where Singaporeans want to protest or demonstrate about issues that concern them, there is the Speakers’ Corner and no permit is needed.Now, here is the balance.Some countries that have traditionally said, \"The freedom to protest is part of the freedom of expression and should not be clamped down\". But, you know, when it comes to the crunch, they take different steps. For example, in 2009, Copenhagen hosted a UN climate conference.Chairman, with your permission, may I display a slide on the LCD screen.The Chairman: Yes, please. [A slide was shown to hon Members.]Mr K Shanmugam:They anticipated widespread protests. And this is Denmark. So, the Danish law enforcement constructed a holding facility. What you see is a holding facility. We do not do this in Singapore. They set up 36 steel cages that could hold more than 350 persons. Anyone who protested would find themselves in there.In London, climate activists calling themselves the Extinction Rebellion mounted non-violent protests for two weeks last year. They conducted marches, blockaded roads and disrupted train services. More than 1,800 were arrested. In one protest, an activist climbed onto the roof of a train during the morning rush hour. Commuters were suitably frustrated. They dragged him off the roof and assaulted him. We do not recommend that in Singapore. But the Metropolitan Police then banned the Extinction Rebellion protests across London.We have been criticised for disallowing protests outside of Speaker’s Corner, even if it was with just one person. But where do we draw the line? One, two, three, 30, 50, 100, 200, 5,000? How many protesters are acceptable? How do we tell what will be a peaceful protest and what will escalate into violence? Part of the issue in Hong Kong is that protests are allowed, the police are only allowed to intervene when it turns violent. So, by the time you have 50,000 people on the streets and some people go in there, let us say 500, mixed up who are deliberately intent on creating violence, how do the police handle this? This sets up the police for failure and sets up the police to be the fall guys.It is far better to say, protests in specific places allowed; otherwise, no protests in other places, because you want to strike a balance between competing interests. Sometimes, people want to protest, say, take iconic places – Orchard Road or Tanglin or places like that – where there is a lot of commercial activity, primarily because of the disturbance it would cause to everyone else and, therefore, their cause would get noticed.So, on the one side is the desire of the protestors to get themselves noticed, on the other side is the disamenity to the rest of the community. Why should protests be favoured and why should the rest of the community say just accept it? Why not we put a place, if you want to protest, you go to a specified place and you protest. And anywhere else, you do not put my Police Force in an impossible position, where they will have to let as many thousand people as they want to congregate, and then deal with violence, as it inevitably, in many places, does result in.So, that is the first lesson. I think our approach, the approach we took was a correct one of being strict about where you can protest. Otherwise, the best Police Force in the world would still not be able to handle it.The second is it cannot be seen purely as a law and order issue. If you seek to deal with protests and your approach to protests is simply to have tough laws and enforce them, it is not going to work. Because underlying it is, what is your social order, what is the level of inequality, what is the social justice, how do people feel in your society? Is it a fair society? Do people want to support the system? Do they, by and large, believe that they benefit from the system? If a large majority of your people feel that it is a fair system, they have opportunities, that the Government and the system are set up to help the largest majority possible, then people will have faith in the system and the people who want to break the laws will be a minority. Then, your Police can handle it.But if a significant section of your population believes that the system is fundamentally unfair, the social economic system and the benefits are fundamentally unfair and that it is set up to benefit a few, at the expense of the majority, at the expense of the many, then no amount of strict policing and strict laws are going to keep people off the streets.What do they have? Why should they support? Why should they support a system that is fundamentally unfair?So, I think the first, I think, order of point of importance for any government and for us as a lesson is, really, the socio-economic, political structure. It must deliver good governance. It must deliver to the majority. Then, your police force can go and deal with those who break the law and the rest of the population will say, \"Yes, we support it; these people ought not to be breaking the law.\" So, law and order, yes, but it is not possible without good governance.None of these concepts are new. All these different approaches have been tried. Those who are familiar with Chinese history will understand legalism, going back to the Qin dynasty, during the Warring States period. That was the preferred way of bringing order to a chaotic, fractious society. The emperor’s rule was based on strict laws, harsh enforcement and collective punishments. But such a system cannot carry on for long. People often misunderstand and think that our approach is based on very strict punishments. Now, it is first and foremost based on making sure that the majority progresses, and that the system is fair. Strict punishments can only be built on such a system. The Qin emperor's rule, as people will note, collapsed, because the approach actually worsened people's social and economic lives.We move forward to the Han Dynasty. China’s emperors tried to follow Confucianism, which depended solely or primarily on the leaders setting the example and inspiring people to be like them, family and social harmony, a responsible government with the moral duty to promote harmony.Confucianism appealed to people because they enjoyed internal peace and stability, and under it, the country experienced remarkable progress. But it had limitations as well because in every society, a large majority of people can be inspired to be good, to be noble, to do the right thing, following the example of leaders, assuming you have leaders who can inspire that kind of confidence. But you will always have a group that will want to challenge your laws, that will want to break them and that will want to destabilise.You will need to deal with them through a system of laws which can be enforced. What framework, how strict, what you allow, what you do not allow must be for each society to decide.So, you have to build the society on a basis of fairness, upholding moral responsibility on the part of the leadership, proper governance, an approach of upright virtuous governance which inspires people and bring that across to the people as a whole and then deal with the law breakers in a way that makes it clear to everybody that the laws would be applied, fairly, evenly–and law-breaking will be dealt with.If there is good governance and people benefit, you can always deal with a small number who want to disrupt.With that background, let me deal with the specific question that Mr Singh asked. I think we can apply these principles, broad as they are, to the specific question. We amended the Road Traffic Act last year to increase deterrence against irresponsible driving. I think all of us agree, including Mr Singh, that there can be very significant socialcosts through irresponsible driving. Yes, in specific cases there may be no incidents, no loss of life. But imagine when there is loss of life. You lose your three-year-old child or you lose your grandmother or grandfather through somebody else's irresponsible driving. And, unfortunately, over the last few years, we have seen an increase or enough incidents of people driving when they should not be driving, when they were under suspension, or driving when they are under the influence of alcohol. People have died as a result of those actions. And we want to send, I wanted to send a very strong signal that penalties are going to be enhanced because we cannot accept people being irresponsible on the roads.And I made a speech saying that we are going to now deal with this. It arose from an incident where a young man who was under suspension drove and hit someone and killed him, if my memory serves me right, a lorry driver. In that case, the young man was from a higher socio-economic group. The lorry driver was from the lower socio-economic group. And I said, I think we got to re-look at this.We therefore, enhanced the penalties in the Road Traffic Act.So, to the specific question whether a discount on fines can be given for first-time offenders, we currently give a discount for demerit points to eligible drivers. If they have accumulated up to one third of the maximum points, if they go for the Safe Driving Course, then, their accumulated points would be taken out.12.15 pmGiving a discount on fines for first-time offenders, we might as well have not increased the fines in the first place. We could have said, first-time offenders, no increase but it may cut against the very policy that we are seeking to put in.I think I understand where Mr Singh is coming from. And my own approach would be that where people cannot afford to pay the fines, then, we should consider flexibility, we should also consider then in giving them some other support to help them pay the fines. But the fines are there. In a way, we should see, and this is where Members of Parliament come in, we should see whether we can help them when they come and see us through the community to help the lower income drivers, to help them pay the fines. That, Traffic Police would take a sympathetic approach. But I think the framework should be kept intact.Chairman, our operating landscape will continue to change. Society will change and progress, and there will be new uncertainties and crises that will emerge – those are the only certainties. I have outlined some of the approaches we take to try and deal with that and to be future-ready, as it were. My fellow Ministers and office-holders will answer the other questions.The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo): Mr Chairman, I will focus on the Home Team's increasing use of science and technology.MHA established the Home Team Science and Technology Agency, or HTX, in December 2019.Mr Christopher de Souza, Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Desmond Choo and Mr Patrick Tay asked how the Home Team will tap the expertise within HTX to mitigate emerging threats and manpower constraints.HTX will house 14 Centres of Expertise to develop deep tech capabilities to support a range of Home Team operations. I will talk about three Centres of Expertise today.First, robotics, automation and unmanned systems. Over the past few months, HTX has developed customised solutions to augment our Police and Civil Defence operations. These solutions allow us to optimise our scarce manpower, and increase operational capacity and agility.For example, HTX worked with the Police to develop the Multi-Purpose All Terrain Autonomous Robot 3.0 or M.A.T.A.R 3.0. M.A.T.A.R 3.0 is a fully autonomous patrol robot. Compared with its previous models, M.A.T.A.R 3.0 has added features such as a tethered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for aerial surveillance and enhanced cameras for long-range surveillance. You can imagine how useful such a device is in terms of sense-making as well as redeploying resources appropriately.Another application of robotics is to save lives in disaster rescue efforts. Urban search and rescue missions are extremely dangerous, particularly at sites where no terrain information is available, such as collapsed buildings or post-disaster sites. Therefore, HTX is studying the use of robots designed to mimic animals in their functions. One such robot is ROVER-X, which can move and manoeuvre like a dog.By customising ROVER-X with navigational capabilities, thermal cameras and sensors, we can deploy it in hazardous terrains that are unsafe for humans, and reduce the time required to find and rescue victims.Later this year, HTX will be testing additional use cases for ROVER-X, such as monitoring hazardous materials, inspecting chemical plants, and supporting the security of key installations.The use of automation and unmanned systems can also alleviate resource-intensive operations, like the on-going fight against COVID-19.With the support of HTX, the Police are progressively deploying CCTVs equipped with video analytics and motion sensors at some Government Quarantine Facilities, to enhance the security of the premises.Our second Centre of Expertise targets chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive threats, or CBRNE for short.CBRNE threats can pose significant risks to public safety. Over the last 10 years, MHA has set up a network of CBRNE detection laboratories and a Bio-Surveillance Programme along our borders. These are our first line of defence against CBRNE threats.The labs enable frontline units to detect and intercept dangerous materials at our checkpoints, and support investigations and intelligence gathering by the Home Team Departments. On average, the labs conduct about 125,000 screenings for dangerous materials every year.There are plans to expand the detection labs to more checkpoints. By 2023, we will build a new lab at Changi Airfreight Centre and more CBRNE facilities at the future Tuas Mega Port and Changi Airport Terminal 5 are in the pipeline.The Bio-Surveillance Programme, which was set up to detect bio-terrorism threats at our checkpoints, is also able to detect other agents such as influenza and health-concerning pathogens. Using a state-of-the-art system, which integrates laboratory functions on a small chip, our scientists can quickly adapt the system to detect new biological agents.This capability was demonstrated in the on-going COVID-19 outbreak. HTX stepped up by designing a kit to rapidly screen and detect the virus immediately after its genome sequence was made public in mid-January. MHA has deployed this kit as part of our Bio-Surveillance Programme at our land, sea and air checkpoints.The third Centre of Expertise focuses on digital forensics. While technology has its benefits, it also provides tools for criminals to commit crimes.This year, HTX and Police will implement the DIGital Evidence Search Tool, or DIGEST for short, to automate the forensic processing of voluminous digital data. DIGEST will relieve the workload of Police Investigation Officers, so that they can focus on other aspects of investigative work. It will also be extended to other Home Team Departments, such as the Central Narcotics Bureau.The fast-growing eco-system for the Internet Of Things means that everyday devices, such as smart watches, home appliances and vehicles, can contain important evidence to support investigations. HTX is developing capabilities to harness data from Internet Of Things devices to support investigations.The above examples illustrate how HTX works closely with the Home Team to develop solutions to protect our safety and security. Moving forward, HTX will play a master-planning role to identify and develop cross-cutting capabilities across the Home Team. This will facilitate greater co-operation and synergy, so that we adopt a unified One Home Team approach in keeping Singapore safe and secure.The Home Team Departments are also constantly refining their operations to tap on technology to deliver better services. For example, ICA has been digitalising its services to achieve its customer-service vision of \"No Fuss, No Visit, No Waiting\", and this will be for Singapore residents and travellers.ICA has already embarked on several initiatives in line with this service vision.For example, Singaporeans can look forward to a more hassle-free and efficient immigration clearance experience. Through the use of cutting-edge biometrics technology, ICA will soon allow Singaporeans to verify their identities and breeze through immigration checkpoints without the need to produce their passports or provide their thumbprints. I know, of course, during this period, no one is thinking of travelling very much. So, the idea of breezing through customs and border control is not so exciting. But the time will come when our airport will be very busy and so will the other checkpoints. This is something that we can deploy to effectively manage the voluminous flow of passengers in and out of Singapore.In 2019, ICA conducted a six-month trial of this contactless clearance concept at the Tuas Checkpoint for about 22,000 Singaporeans. The results of the trial were successful and ICA has since extended the trial to Changi Airport Terminal 4.I agree with Mr Patrick Tay and Ms Jessica Tan that it is important that the Home Team prepare and equip our officers to adapt to technological transformations.A key priority is to grow our talent pool of engineers and scientists. We have ambitious plans to grow HTX from 1,300 officers today to around 2,000 officers.Given the wide spectrum of capabilities the Home Team requires, HTX will recruit talent across practically all disciplines of science and engineering. We will need scientists trained in life and physical sciences for the development of crime forensics and CBRNE detection capabilities. We will need electrical, mechanical and software engineers who can work in blended teams to realise operational systems such as advanced video sensors and robotics. Last but not least, we will need computer scientists and engineers to tackle the challenges posed by data and digital technologies. They will be deployed in various roles, from cybersecurity to developing algorithms, to augment the Home Team's frontline response.We have already seen strong interest in HTX as a career. In 2019 alone, about 170 officers joined HTX. They were a good mix of fresh graduates and mid-career professionals. This year, we will ramp up recruitment even more.As we build deep science and technology capabilities within HTX, we will concurrently build up a cadre of uniformed officers who are grounded in operational experience and proficient in technology.To nurture such officers, we are progressively introducing an \"Ops-Tech Career Track\" for Home Affairs Uniformed Services officers across the Home Team Departments. There will be structured pathways to enhance these officers’ operational experience and exposure to technology. These officers can also embark on further studies to develop technical knowledge.As a start, over 200 such Ops-Tech posts, with redesigned job scopes, will be identified within key Police and Civil Defence departments and frontline units.Together, the HTX and Ops-Tech officers will work together with the larger Home Team workforce to innovate and deliver solutions to support the Home Team’s mission.The Chairman: Mr Amrin Amin.The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin): Mr Chairman, I will speak on two areas: combating drug abuse and strengthening the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders.The international drug situation is grim. One in 18 adults in the world used drugs at least once in a year, according to the 2019 World Drug Report. New psychoactive substances, or NPS, is a rising threat. NPS mimics the psychoactive effects of traditional drugs. In 2009, 126 NPS were detected worldwide. Within 10 years, the number has increased sevenfold to 892.We are seeing a global movement towards more liberal attitudes on drugs. More countries are legalising drug abuse or are considering to do so.The media fuels this legalisation wave. They gloss over documented harms of cannabis like mental disorders.Pro-legalisation camps also conveniently ignore the socialcosts – lives lost, families destroyed, increased crimes.Singapore is not immune to a worsening global drug situation.First, attitudes of young Singaporeans towards drugs are changing. Three in five new drug abusers arrested last year were below 30. An MHA survey found that youths in Singapore have more liberal views on drugs, particularly, cannabis. One in five held the view that cannabis abuse should be legal in Singapore.Second, the rising threat of NPS. A decade ago, NPS was hardly known in Singapore. Now, NPS is the third most commonly abused drug. Four-hundred and fourteen or 11.7% of drug abusers took NPS in 2019.More than ever, we need strict laws to stay ahead of drug trends, robust enforcement and effective preventive drug education.This is a multi-year effort. I am happy to announce that this year, we will enhance two areas: first, review our laws to robustly deal with the rising threat of NPS, and second, sharpen preventive drug education with a focus on correcting misinformation about drugs and addressing changing attitudes towards cannabis.On NPS, we have been proactively listing NPS to the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) since 2010. But as Mr Christopher de Souza pointed out, the difficulty is rogue chemists are able to swiftly produce new NPS variants by changing their chemical structures. This poses a challenge for drug enforcement agencies the world over. MHA is reviewing our laws to stay ahead of drug trends. Details will be announced in due course.12.30 pmEffective preventive drug education must achieve two important aims. First, our people must know the facts about drugs. And second, the effort must garner community support. Strict laws and robust enforcement require the people's backing. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin and Mr Mohamed Irshad asked how we help our youths stand firm against drug abuse. Mr Christopher de Souza asked about our strategies against cannabis.Our preventive drug education starts from pre-school. In schools, we teach the facts about drugs through story-telling and activities. A cartoon activity book for pre-schoolers will be ready in April, an Anti-drug Ambassador Activity (AAA) booklet has been used by over 48,000 Primary school students in 2019 and 60 Secondary schools have been offered an after-school anti-drug engagement programme.Information on harms of drugs must be easily understood and put in layman terms. For instance, as suggested by Mr Christopher de Souza, we state in our press releases how many abusers have their drug addictions fed from drugs found on a trafficker.To counter growing misinformation about cannabis, we are making facts about cannabis accessible. We have a one-stop repository for cannabis-related information on CNB's website. Infographics on the harms of cannabis and the socialcosts of legalising cannabis are on social media platforms, and an anti-cannabis information booklet for educators will be ready this year.Mr Chairman, to win community support, a one-way exchange of information will not be enough. At the heart of what we do is to speak with our people frankly, give them the facts, hear them out, and involve them to co-create and deliver. We have frank conversations. The National Council Against Drug Abuse, or NCADA, will launch \"HIGH\", an interactive film by Royston Tan, in March. Viewers get to make choices and learn the consequences of their choices in this film. At our preview screenings, we invited youths to no-holds barred conversations on drugs, revealing its ugly, gritty realities.We co-created projects with youths from all institutes of higher learning. One-hundred and sixty youths are our Anti-Drug Abuse Advocates and they have organised four roadshows and campaigns raising awareness amongst their peers. Republic Polytechnic and Nanyang Polytechnic students created two anti-drug games to teach about the harms of drugs. ITE students have produced anti-drug videos and Temasek Polytechnic students had a social media campaign on how drugs affect our loved ones.Ms Rahayu Mahzam, Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and Mr Mohamed Irshad asked about community anti-drug engagement efforts. We have been working with various groups – youths, LGBTQ+, ethnic communities, parent groups and others.Last September, Indian youths and 13 Indian community groups organised the Bothaiporulai Ethirtu Nirpom, or BEN, campaign. BEN is a short form, a Tamil phrase – \"We Stand United Against Drugs\". Indian celebrity, Anand K, helped as an anti-drug ambassador. We gave out envelopes and snack packets with anti-drug messages at the Deepavali bazaar.We worked with various LGBTQ groups on anti-drug campaigns, discussion forums, research and outreach activities in support of a drug-free lifestyle. Mr Chairman, I will now speak in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Our efforts to free the community from the evil grip of drugs have become more important. The global situation is getting increasingly challenging. More countries now have a more open attitude towards drugs. Worryingly, they are unable to manage the drug problem within their own societies.It is different in Singapore. I remember attending an international drug rehabilitation conference in Argentina last October. Singapore received thunderous applause from international drug rehabilitation experts when I shared that the number of Malay drug addicts in Singapore went down by almost half – from around 3,200 in 1993 to 1,800 last year.The number of drug offenders has jumped in many countries. They feel defeated and some had to liberalise their laws against drugs because it has become unmanageable. The Malay community in Singapore stands out – we multiply the Government's effort, we do not give up and we do not shirk away from difficult tasks.But we must stay cautious. Our society is exposed to influences from abroad and in the cyber world. Myths about drugs like cannabis are widespread. The myth is cannabis is not harmful This is totally wrong. Studies after studies have proven so. Surveys by MHA have shown that Singapore youths have a more open attitude towards drugs, especially cannabis. One in five youths think that cannabis should be allowed in Singapore. Three in five new drug offenders arrested are under 30 years old.This is worrying. New types of drugs like New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) are the third most popular drug in Singapore, and among new drug offenders, NPS is the second most popular drug. We must not stand still or get complacent. The strategies to combat the drug menace will be strengthened. The three strategies are – tighter laws, stronger enforcement and a more effective drug prevention education.I am pleased to announce that this year, MHA will focus more efforts on two things.First, reviewing legislation to stop the threat of NPS that is becoming increasingly widespread, and second, countering the myths and misinformation about drugs and manage the increasingly open attitude towards cannabis because it is harmful.This is the Government's pledge – we will continue to work with Malay organisations, families and our young people to protect our community and our families, and prevent us from being enslaved by drugs. For those in need, we will help them to recover and continue their journey towards excellence.The M³ movement led by MUIS, MENDAKI and MESRA has focused its attention towards offenders and their families. MUIS has launched the FITRAH programme in November 2018. Over 320 volunteers supportg FITRAH. MENDAKI organised the Family Excellence Circle programme to assist care-givers, offenders and couples. MESRA will customise several courses from the SHIOK series to meet the needs of the families of ex-offenders, especially for the young.Malay organisations are also ready to assist – AMP, PERGAS, JAMIYAH, PPIS, Club Heal and the Harun Ghani Education Fund. The \"Dadah Itu Haram\" campaign continues to receive solid support from motorcycle enthusiasts, fishing hobbyists, asatizahs as well as dikir barat and theatre activists. Forty-two mosques as well as 200 shops and organisations also have come forward to help.Currently, over 75 barber shops support the campaign by becoming informal anti-drug advisors. These barbers are learning more about the harmful nature of cannabis and share with their clients about the harms in order to counter the myths surrounding cannabis.We will look at the effectiveness of these efforts through surveys that are taking place currently. This year, we will focus on family and youth programmes.(In English): Mr Chairman, I will now speak about the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. Mr Christopher de Souza asked how the Amendments to the MDA in 2019 has affected inmates' risks of re-offending.The full suite of MDA changes took effect last August, so it is still early to make any conclusions on their impact. We will continue to monitor.Mr Murali Pillai asked how we can reduce re-offending. Prisons will strengthen support for offenders in three ways. First, family support. Family plays a critical part. Prisons has started the Family Interventions and Reintegration Support Team, or FIRST trial, and family case managers work with community partners to support inmates' families. Over 100 inmates have benefited from this trial and results are encouraging. Prisons will be enhancing collaborations with social service agencies.Second, a network of positive peers to support ex-offenders stay crime-free. Prisons will expand its Throughcare Volunteer Framework to encourage more volunteers and support inmates pre- and post-release.Third, the offenders. Inmates will be empowered to take charge of their rehabilitation through the Prisons' Digitisation of Inmate Rehabilitation and Corrections Tool, or DIRECT. Inmates use shared tablets to learn and keep in touch with their loved ones via electronic letters.Gainful employment is another critical part. Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) prepares offenders for employment through employer engagement, skills training and employment assistance. More than 5,600 employers from various industries offer jobs to ex-offenders. Almost 6,000 offenders went for an average of four training courses each last year. Over 2,600 offenders received employment assistance, with 96% securing jobs before prison release.SCORE will further support inmates to get industry-relevant skills. SCORE will partner Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association (SPETA) and MediaCorp to set up precision engineering and media skills training academies this year.Mr Chairman, colleagues, the choices we make today affect tomorrow. We will keep Singapore safe and secure together.The Chairman: Ms Sun Xueling.The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling): Mr Chairman, I have 12 cuts to cover. I seek your indulgence, if I eat slightly into clarification time.The Chairman: Okay.Ms Sun Xueling: Thank you. Mr Chairman, I will focus on MHA's efforts to tackle tech-enabled crimes and also our partnerships with the community for crisis-preparedness. I will also address the questions raised by Members.Technology has changed the way in which criminals operate. Social media platforms offer criminals a new means of targeting victims. Foreign syndicates use the internet and spoofing technology to obscure their identity and conduct illegal activities. Our enforcement capabilities must keep pace with technological developments.Scams are an area of concern. Last year, we saw a significant rise in Police reports of scams. Most are online scams. Ms Jessica Tan, Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Dr Tan Wu Meng asked what more can be done.Police have been enhancing their capabilities to disrupt such activities. For instance, the Anti-Scam Centre was set up in 2019 to mitigate the losses of victims.We will do more. Given the different domains that online scams can impact, we will be setting up an Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams (IMCS) comprising of MHA, MCI, MTI and other members to execute a comprehensive strategy to combat scams. This will include (a) deterring potential perpetrators; (b)\tlimiting the ability of perpetrators to conduct operations in Singapore; (c)\tmitigating the losses incurred by victims; and (d)\tensuring that the public is vigilant and wary of scams. The Committee will coordinate approaches and efforts across the Government and pool resources.But even as the Government steps up efforts to combat scams, we cannot do it alone. Businesses have a role to play too, especially those such as e-commerce platforms and banks, which can also be exploited by scammers, causing monetary losses to customers. We will work closely with such businesses to put in place upstream measures to limit the ability of criminals to do harm.That said, the best defence against scams continues to be a discerning public. Criminals are looking to exploit people's feelings for loved ones or other personal motivations. We urge the public to be sceptical of incredulous promises, to utilise escrow accounts provided by the platforms for transaction where possible, and to check with the authorities when approached by dubious people purporting to be Government officials. Police will continue to work with the National Crime Prevention Council to engage the community and spread this message. Mr Chairman, I would now like to make a few remarks in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.] Scammers are constantly devising new ways to ensnare their victims. With the increase in online transactions, online scams have also increased. This is worrying. The Government will be setting up an inter-Ministry committee to discuss how to tackle scams. Businesses also have to take responsibility and establish secure platforms for transactions, to effectively protect consumer rights.For the public, the best defence against scams is to stay vigilant and discerning. We urge the public to do transactions only on trustworthy platforms and utilise escrow accounts. If you have any doubts, please check with the relevant authorities. Let us be vigilant so that the scammers do not stand a chance(In English): Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the actions taken against those who pose as charities to solicit donations. Any person found guilty of falsely representing a registered charity to solicit money is liable to a fine of up to $10,000, three years imprisonment, or both. Depending on the facts of the case, the person may also be liable for offences in the Penal Code or the House to House and Street Collections Act.Mr Christopher de Souza asked what we will do to tackle the unlicensed money lending (UML) situation. The Police will work with stakeholders such as banks to take action against suspected UML runners. The fourth anti-UML campaign was also launched in January 2020.12.45 pmMr Yee Chia Hsing suggested that messages from UMLs and sports betting syndicates should be made more easily reportable. We thank the Member for his feedback. We will continue to explore ways for such spam messages to be reported more conveniently.Mr Leon Perera raised a question on regulating gambling, specifically loot boxes. MHA takes into consideration whether the player can convert any in-game assets into real-world ones through the platform. If so, we may block the game from being accessed from Singapore. The game operator may also be liable under the Remote Gambling Act.Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the Home Team’s efforts to combat human trafficking. Our officers undergo regular training on how to recognise the tell-tale signs and respond sensitively to victims of human trafficking. Our agencies exchange information on human trafficking syndicates with our foreign counterparts.Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked whether LTVP+ can be granted to all foreign spouses of citizens. Our policy for transnational couples is generally to facilitate the formation of stable families here. A foreign spouse can be granted a LTVP if the sponsor is able to support the family. An LTVP+ may be granted later if the marriage proves stable. On the matter of rental housing, the couple can apply for a rental flat if they have a citizen or PR child. For those with other household structures, HDB will consider their request on a case-by-case basis.Mr Patrick Tay, Dr Tan Wu Meng and Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the Home Team's plans to partner the community to deal with threats to our safety and security. We are fortunate that Singapore has not experienced a terror attack in the past few decades, but we must not be complacent. Terrorism causes loss of lives, injuries and damage to properties. But of more concern – it can tear societies apart.We launched the SGSecure programme in 2016 to sensitise, train and mobilise our community to play a part in preventing and responding to a terrorist attack. We will continue to roll out customised programmes for different domains, such as schools, workplaces, neighbourhoods and community groups.To enhance the community's first response for cardiac arrest victims, we launched the Save-A-Life initiative in 2015. More than 5,200 AEDs have been installed in Singapore since then. Over half a million people have been trained in CPR-AED skills, of which 75,000 have registered with the myResponder app to assist victims of cardiac arrest prior to the arrival of SCDF.Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked how SCDF will continue to provide efficient and effective Emergency Medical Services. The EMS Tiered Response Framework was launched in 2017, which allow us to prioritise life-threatening emergencies, to receive faster and enhanced services.Still, one out of 10 calls received are false alarms or non-emergencies. Since April 2019, cases assessed by SCDF as non-emergencies will not be conveyed to the hospitals. This ensures that SCDF resources are only used for emergency cases. SCDF will continue to raise public awareness on when 995 should be called.To conclude, the Home Team will develop stronger capabilities to deal with new challenges, but more importantly, we need to work in partnership with the community. Together, let us build a safer and more secure home.The Chairman: Clarifications, please? Mr Christopher de Souza.Mr Christopher de Souza: Thank you, Mr Chairman, I have two clarifications.First is on illegal scams. I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for her answer. In these sorts of situations where a person is victimised and been made to part with money, in fact, there are two legal recourses. The first is the civil recourse in the courts for misrepresentation or fraudulent misrepresentation, and the second is criminal prosecution under section 420 of the Penal Code, which is cheating.Given the number of scams that Members of the House have seen, life savings being parted, my clarification is, really, of those two options, would the Attorney-General's Chambers and the Police, in appropriate circumstances, prefer the criminal prosecution route under the Penal Code? This is much more convenient for the victim who has already lost a lot of money and does not require the victim to go and take out a separate civil suit. That is the first clarification.The second clarification is on human trafficking. It was unfortunate to see the first case of labour trafficking in Singapore, but it is also good to see that there was a prosecution for labour trafficking. I understand the statistics to be that most of the human trafficking prosecutions are sex trafficking. What can we do to prioritise more prosecutions and investigations under labour trafficking?Ms Sun Xueling: I thank the Member for his questions.On the first question he had,as I mentioned in my answer, depending on the facts of the case, the person may be liable for offences in the Penal Code, Cheating, section 420, which the Member referred to, and also potentially under the House to House and Street Collections Act.At the end of the day, the AGC has to make that decision depending on the facts of the case. That said, MHA and MinLaw are studying the current landscape for dealing with such cases including civil claims, private prosecutions and upstream measures, to see if the current processes can be further streamlined or improved. We will share more details in due course.On your second question on human trafficking, the SPF conducts regular enforcement operations to detect and deter illegal vice activities, and MOM takes enforcement actions against errant employers and employment agencies who may be involved in potential labour trafficking. So, both SPF and MOM work jointly together to make sure that they are enforcing, taking precautions against both sex trafficking as well as labour trafficking.SPF and MOM have a standard operating procedure with the ICA for the referral of potential human trafficking cases detected at the borders to aid SPF's and MOM's follow-up investigations, and they use different methods. The officers are actually trained to look out for either both sex trafficking or labour trafficking offences.Mr Pritam Singh: Mr Chairman, I have two clarifications for Minister Shanmugam. These pertain to the cut that I filed on traffic summons.The first clarification I have is on instalment payment plans by Traffic Police. I am not aware that Traffic Police offers instalment plans for fines. So I just want the Minister to confirm that because it has not been my experience when I write in to the authorities, that residents have the option of paying those summons by way of instalments. I have had that experience with ICA and LTA but not Traffic Police.The second question I have pertains to the Minister's point about the suggestion I had on potentially halving the fine. It is not just halving the fine for the sake of it. In other jurisdictions, they halve a fine for different policy purposes, mainly to make sure people pay their fines. But there are other policy objectives that can be considered, for example, in the case of beating a red light, which is a very serious offence; I concede that point. What you can potentially have is, halving of a fine, but also making sure that that offender goes to the Traffic Police. If it has to be a programme where he sees what the potential impact can be of these offences, people dying, there also could be some possible policy benefits insofar as greater awareness of road safety, as an example.Mr K Shanmugam: On the first question on instalments, I should have been clearer. We allow some flexibility in deserving cases. But I think we do not want a situation where everyone comes and asks for the flexibility. So, there has got to be a rubric or framework. We are approaching it in the same way, in the sense that we both recognise, and everybody recognises, there are some people who need help, and the question is how best to help them. So, one is flexibility that is offered by Traffic Police. The second which can cover a larger group would be for the Members of Parliament to help, for them to approach their Members and for them to help, through utilising community resources for those who deserve or need the help.So, that I have done it, many Members of Parliament have done it, I am sure the Member would have done it. But also for Traffic Police, you write in. If the situation is such that the person needs some flexibility, that can be given.On the second point on halving the fine, if I understood the point rightly, it is to achieve the policy objective of persuading them or encouraging them not to commit the offence. Again. I think we are on the same ground here, in that we ought to try and look for ways in which we encourage people not to re-offend. So, the objective of the fine, the primary objective of the fine or penalty, should not be to punish but to try and have people incorporate that into the way they drive, so that they do not even offend in the first place, or if they do often, they do not re-offend.So, I will ask the Traffic Police to study these specific suggestions. When they looked at other jurisdictions, a variety of things – we even considered the possibility of people with different income levels paying different amounts; that is tried in some countries too. But we decided it did not quite work. So, we have not shelved it completely. We have KIV-ed it to relook. But for a variety of reasons, it did not seem to work very well, but we will certainly look at the suggestions that Mr Singh has made.Mr Murali Pillai: Mr Chairman, Sir, I thank the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Amrin Amin for his response to my cut speech on Rehabilitating and Reintegrating Ex-offenders.I welcome the pilot project that he announced about involving family in the rehabilitation of ex-offenders. I wonder in relation to the aftercare scheme for these ex-offenders, particularly these ex-offenders who were involved in gang activities leading to offences being committed, or committing offences as a result of negative peer influence, whether after they have been released, the circle they keep can be monitored, so that they would be prevented from rejoining the gangs or re-linking up with friends who caused the offences in the first place.Mr Amrin Amin: Certainly, the Member's concerns are correct, it is something that we are doing. We are also working closely with MSF to see how we can better support ex-offenders, in particular, preventing youths from joining gangs or rejoining gangs. So, there are various programmes and we are happy to invite Mr Murali to join us and we will see how we can share more about our work.Assoc Prof Walter Theseira: Thank you. Mr Chairman. I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sun for that reply. Just two clarifications for her.The first is, is there a pathway for LTVP holders to obtain permanent residency if they are in a stable marriage with a Singapore Citizen spouse? That is because there is considerable uncertainty without such a pathway, there might even be cases where a Singapore Citizen child might grow up without knowing whether one of their parents has the right to remain in Singapore.The second clarification is: would she be able to elaborate on the housing situation, maybe at the MND's Committee of Supply, for such families or, otherwise, put more information out because, again, there are a lot of uncertainties out there for such families about what are their rights for housing and how can they achieve stable housing?1.00 pmMs Sun Xueling: I thank the Member for his clarification. We recognise the importance of keeping Singapore Citizen families, especially those with Singapore Citizen children, intact as far as possible. Each PR application is evaluated holistically on a set of criteria which includes factors such as the individual's economic contributions, qualifications, age and family profile to assess the applicant's ability to contribute as well as integrate well into society.I had mentioned the LTVP+ in my response. It was introduced in 2012 to provide more support to foreign spouses of Singapore Citizens whose marriages have been stabled over time. It also has quite a lot of benefits. It provides greater certainty of stay, additional benefits such as inpatient healthcare subsidies that already are at a level, that is similar to that of Permanent Residents (PRs). Whether or not, the foreign spouse qualifies yet for PR, I think the fact of the matter is that when you have the LTVP+, you are assured of a significant length of stay in Singapore. He or she can also continue to remain in Singapore and also seek permanent residency when the time comes.On the Member's question on rental housing, I had shared in my reply that when there is a Singapore Citizen child, or a PR child involved, then the Singapore Citizen and the non-resident spouse can apply for rental housing. If there are other family structures, then HDB will look at it on a case-by-case basis. If the Member would like further discussion on it, depending on how much time we have at MND's Committee of Supply, I will try to take it up at that juncture as well.The Chairman: Mr de Souza, would you like to withdraw your amendment?Mr Christopher de Souza: I would like to thank the Ministers and the office holders for their comprehensive replies. We all know Home Team is a master at multi-tasking, having to deal with COVID-19 now, new and emerging threats and over and above that, keeping law and order in Singapore. So, on behalf of my fellow Parliamentarians, we put on record our thanks and appreciation to all the arms and bodies that report to MHA. With that Mr Chairman, I seek leave to withdraw my amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $6,184,681,500 for Head P ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $814,275,900 for Head P ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates."

        "Section Name": "Budget",
        "MPs Speaking": "[The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien), Mr Speaker, Mr Speaker]",
        "Content": "1.49 pmThe Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien): Mr Speaker, it has been an eventful start of the year, with Singapore battling the COVID-19 outbreak. It is through such difficult times that we prove our mettle as a nation and as a people.The Government's response to the crisis has been swift. Deputy Prime Minister Heng announced a $4 billion package to cushion the near-term uncertainties caused by COVID-19. Various Ministries have detailed how they are introducing measures to mitigate the impact to their respective sectors. It has been a defining element in the Budget 2020 debate. The fact that this Government has sufficient financial resources, accumulated through financial prudence, was not lost on the Members. Neither was the call for all segments of the society to play an active part as Team Singapore in riding out the challenge.Indeed, many stakeholders came together to deliver help. For instance, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) acted quickly to form the Tourism Recovery Action Task Force, comprising tourism leaders from the private and public sectors to map out recovery strategies. MOM, MOT, MTI, NTUC and MCCY will roll out measures to help self-employed persons of multiple sectors, including allowance for training.The COVID-19 outbreak may have generated fear and anxiety among Singaporeans but it has also shown our community at its best. We have heard about the numerous ground-up, spontaneous acts of care. Mr Liang Eng Hwa shared how larger businesses are stepping up to help smaller ones tide through this crisis, while the SG Cares Volunteer Centres brought community groups and resourceful corporations along to reach out to vulnerable groups. These efforts exemplify the strong community spirit in Singapore today.Dr Koh Poh Koon and Mr Teo Ser Luck rightly pointed out that in times of crisis, come opportunity. Some Members, such as Prof Yaacob Ibrahim, have called for Singapore to take stock and reflect on how we can be better versions of ourselves as a response to the challenge. Many of our industries and businesses appreciate the need to transform so they are better prepared to deal with the next disruption. Members like Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked that we also build up Singapore's civic spirit, psychological defence and social cohesion so that we emerge from this crisis stronger as a nation.Even as we are occupied with the challenges of the present, we have our eyes firmly on the long-term issues. Many Members spoke passionately on ensuring Singapore's competitiveness and relevance in a fast-changing world. Mr Lim Swee Say reminded us that our common goal is to generate sufficient resources to improve the lives of all our people. This is evidenced by the large number of questions received by MOE and MOM on education and training for Singaporeans, pipping even MOH despite the current public health situation.Singapore's current and future challenges will be increasingly complex and unexpected. If we harness the diverse strengths of Singaporeans and work together as one, just as we are doing with COVID-19, we can turn our challenges into opportunities, our problems into possibilities. We can build a future Singapore that we and those after us can be proud of. This is the essence of Singapore Together. The debates in the past few days have presented us with long-term challenges – how to age well, how to uplift the disadvantaged, how to build a climate resilient nation and so on. To tackle them, we must partner to build our Singapore together.So, I am heartened to hear the theme of partnerships come through strongly in our debates. The momentum is clear. Singaporeans can and want to play a bigger role in shaping Singapore. Government agencies will be opening up many more opportunities for Singaporeans from all walks of life and all segments of the society. We will co-create and co-deliver initiatives to make Singapore a resilient nation, a city of possibilities, a society with opportunities for all and a caring and cohesive community. Let me review each of them.First, a resilient nation in the face of global disruptions. Members agree that it is critical we remain nimble. Mr Cedric Foo and Mr Ong Teng Koon spoke about the opportunities and challenges caused by the rise of the digital economy. To this end, MCI shared how its community partners are helping Singaporeans and our SMEs build digital skills. Mr Dennis Tan and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah highlighted the dangers of climate change. As part of its response, MEWR is catalysing citizen-led initiatives to address our sustainability challenges through its two Citizens' Workgroups. And might I say, the youths are also very passionate about this aspect.Second, a city of possibilities. Singapore should continue to be an attractive place to live, work and play. Mr Douglas Foo and Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar highlighted more can be done to ensure Singaporeans' continued employability and relevance for the future. Ms Jessica Tan, Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr Zainal Sapari spoke passionately on harnessing the resources of our mid-career workers – those in their 40s and 50s. To give Singaporeans a good head start and realise their full potential through their careers, MOE and MOM are working with industry leaders, private training providers and professionals to scale up their respective SkillsFuture programmes and Mid-Career Support Package.Responding to Mr Arasu Duraisamy's and Mr Saktiandi Supaat's queries on the future of our cityscape, MND spoke about plans to partner Singaporeans to re-design, redevelop and rejuvenate Singapore. In the digital realm, Mr Vikram Nair and Ms Tin Pei Ling painted a vision of a Smart Nation with citizens at its centre and PMO shared how Singaporeans can be involved in the entire process of building our Smart Nation, from conceptualising to deploying digital products and services.Third, a society with opportunities for all. Members like Mr Ang Wei Neng, Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, Miss Cheryl Chan and Ms Rahayu Mahzam agree that we want to create a society with more opportunities for all, whether for children and youths in disadvantaged families, persons with special needs, or working mothers who shoulder a disproportionate amount of care-taking responsibilities. As Ms Denise Phua put it, our social challenges need to be tackled together, and the community's role is crucial in ensuring no one falls through the cracks. MOE and MSF shared how they are working with corporates, individuals and community stakeholders to co-create and deliver services that will strengthen our social support for disadvantaged groups through the UPLIFT programme, and allow all Singaporeans to participate fully as contributing members of society.Fourth, a caring and cohesive community. In light of growing polarisation around the world, we need to show regard and respect for one another regardless of our differences and build a cohesive community with a shared identity. The Government will work with Singaporeans on this journey. Ms Anthea Ong's and Mr Murali Pillai's calls to focus on mental health were answered by MSF, which is working with interested Singaporeans in the Youth Mental Well-being Action Group. My Ministry also agrees with Mr Pritam Singh that more can be done for the integration of new citizens, and we will be partnering citizens to co-create content for the Singapore Citizenship Journey, so that new citizens share the same understanding of what it means to be Singaporean.Mr Speaker, I wish to conclude the debate by thanking all Members for their active participation over the past weeks. On behalf of the House, I would also like to thank you, Mr Speaker, and your deputies for your able stewardship of the debate proceedings. I also thank the Parliament Secretariat and staff for their dedicated assistance and responses to our requests and queries, particularly those who took our temperatures and kept our premises clean, and the interpreters who were with us every step of this debate. Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. [Applause.]1.58 pmMr Speaker: A year ago, we had an extensive conversation about cows, and a particular sacred cow, to be precise. We debated till the cows came home, we milked the issue to death and we slayed the creature good and proper. You would have thought that, that was done.But, guess what? I do not know if you have noticed but the cow is back again this year.This time, it sneaked into the MEWR's Committee of Supply (COS) in the guise of a \"fake cow\". Minister Masagos Zulkifli brought it in. We learnt from him – Minister Masagos Zulkifli, not the cow – about how critical it is to have food sustainability amidst climate change and why novel foods may play a big part in this effort.Last year's cow was called \"PSLE Streaming\". This time, it is called \"Impossible Meat\" – and we even sampled it in the form of satay and gyoza, which was really quite delicious. But did we stop at cows? No. We had the whole Mandai Zoo, River Safari and Jurong Bird Park here as well. MEWR introduced us to cell-cultured shrimps from the local start-up, Shiok Meats. We learnt about barramundis from Barramundi Asia, Singapore's first and only deep sea fish farm. But could all these be our future source of protein?MEWR then talked about mosquitoes with names like Aedes mosquitoes and Wolbachia as we are reminded to stay vigilant in our war against dengue. Then, came the cats, and the pet birds and dogs during MND's Committee of Supply (COS).And then, MOT came on board as well, addressed the concerns about the Raffles Banded Langurs – not just any monkeys but Langurs named Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello and Raphael. So, in an indirect way, turtles of the Ninja genus were also dragged into the conversation as well.All these creatures were raised not for any trivial reasons. Some revolved around our survival in a time of possible food disruption. Some were about disease management and its sometimes fatal impact on our people. Some were discussed in terms of our common space with pets and how we treat animals in our society. And some were discussed in the context of how we must try to be sensitive to our environment and nature, amidst development. Langurs may not mean very much to many Singaporeans – perhaps it should – but it means a great deal to Dr Andie Ang and her team who are working closely with LTA on the local habitat concerned.All these are just small slivers of a bigger whole. So very much goes on without many of us realising it. I think an opportunity to debate and discuss this in Parliament reminds us of how much goes on out there, every day. Nothing is too trivial not to be addressed. My Deputy Speakers and I had the privilege of enduring all your speeches in the last few weeks. I make no apologies for the use of that term. Why? Because it can be substantive and heavy; and it represents an even larger body of work that exists out there in the Ministries and agencies as they seek to make life better for all of us.People often ask me to view this video clip or other from other parliaments. Some are the fighting ones which are very exciting. You can go and watch it but do not get ideas. Others are most eloquent, humorous, sharply satirical – impressive. But I then ask myself, after watching then, \"So, therefore... and what is next? So, what then do we do?\"Words can flow like honey, music to the ears but they must be real. They set in motion the journey from words to deeds. For that to happen, we need processes, specific initiatives, mechanisms, effective delivery for good to take place. It is really quite some distance to travel from ideas and rhetoric to reality.Today, we are often seized by form and style. But how to get things done way less exciting, much less glamorous.So, it is challenging to sit through all these, but it is the least we can do to honour the effort and hard work put in by so many.The Budget is the blueprint from which we build our future.To be honest, many do not actually watch the clips of every speaker here, read their speeches and the responses but we are definitely very quick to comment! So, do give it a shot because they can be quite educational and give us a sense of how we intend to address the concerns that are out there. They also show us how we can realise our vision of the kind of Singapore we want to build together.It is true, perhaps we could do with a little more flair, a little more panache but never, never give up the way we do business here in Singapore – solid, down-to-earth ideas, plans and execution. And not just creating beautiful castles in the air.For obvious reasons, COVID-19 situation featured significantly. Let me use it to illustrate some themes that are relevant to what we need to think about during our annual Budgets.We read of some Singaporeans shunning our nurses. Rather than cheering them on and honouring them as many have done, these Singaporeans are concerned about themselves. Why is there a rush for masks or groceries or toilet paper? Individuals are anxious for their own well-being. That is logical.But these actions impact society's common good.In many countries and we read of this today, this is severely affecting the frontline healthcare workers who face problems being properly equipped. Ultimately, our individual actions affect society and it comes back round. The tragedy of the commons is happening right before our eyes.Can we, in Singapore, rise above ourselves and be different from others? As Leader said, can we be better versions of ourselves?In our annual Budget as well, do we not also grapple with the individual and society? As I had shared in previous years' summations, this is what we need to trade off: me versus we, today versus tomorrow. We cannot always have the cake and eat it because that is real life. If we, as a people, are prepared to think about the collective and the future, we can sit down, we can discuss business and talk about what to do. But if it is just about me and myself, today and now, then, honestly there would not be much of a Singapore or future to aspire towards.From the COVID-19 situation, we also realise how inter-connected we are, both within Singapore and also with the world. We are part of a common humanity and we cannot turn our backs on that. You can see how easy it is to infect each other. You can see how easy it is to blame each other. But are we also not sometimes guilty here in Singapore as we blame others as well? But do we not also realise that in other people's eyes, we are \"the others\"? Sadly, we read recently of one of our young Singaporeans being beaten up by YOBS in England simply because he is Asian, because he is Chinese. Simply put, the racists.We see these tensions amidst globalisation. There is the good that comes with globalisation but there are also disamenities and we know that. Some politicians use it to stir a visceral anger that comes from the nationalism that is within all of us. Sometimes, it will be about race and religion. We see it in our discourse here in Singapore sometimes. We need to remain plugged in so that Singaporeans can benefit. We maximise the positive outcomes while mitigating the negatives.Our present abilities to manage COVID-19 are totally reflective of lifelong learning. Because of SARS, we resolved to make sure that the 33 who lost their lives did not do so in vain. We learnt – we learnt from others, we practised, we learned again – during H1N1. And all these allowed us to put up a good solid response today. And our team is still learning and adjusting, even as we speak, and the real payoffs are in the lives saved. And this did not happen by chance.And we did not just learn, we spent and invested for the future. We stockpiled masks, we kept replenishing and refreshing our stock. We have also been doing so for food for the longest time. When we spend for the future, in any Budgets, we have less to spend on the present. No average person is seized by these long-term issues that may or may not happen and we all know the common complaint that Singaporeans may have: why do you not care for me today? I have problems today.But you see, the truth is we do. Suddenly, yesterday's tomorrow just became our today.That is why we are able to do what we do during this crisis. With our prudence and savings, we are able to fund and deal with this event that just dropped on our laps. We did the same in all the major crises that came by our way in the past. The economic impact will affect more people detrimentally than those who may be infected. That is why the economy is important. That is why we pay attention to the economy, we budget for the present, but we continue to budget for future uncertainties as well. Imagine if we were short-termed in outlook? I think many countries are guilty of that. Imagine if we were short term. Imagine if we decided to spend more, save less. It is far easier to be popular than to be prepared.But I am grateful to this Parliament, to all of us here, both Government and Opposition, for supporting these moves. When you look past all the political bluster, there is actually strong unity in approach, not only for this Budget, but for the Budgets past. Parliament is able to do this only because the people of Singapore are prepared to support it. Yet, I know every one of us will still grumble about why we did not get more of this or did not get more of that. But our people's support allows Parliament to have the courage to take the more difficult but yet perhaps the more correct path.This support will not exist and does not exist if there is no sense of unity and no sense of togetherness, which is why the idea of Singapore Together is really, really, so precious. It is not just a slogan, something that we just mouth off in Parliament. They are actually things that we can do. SG Cares, for example, helps us to reach out, volunteer, connect with others. It allows us to practise our empathy and compassion and to bring out the innate good that is in all of us. Our community efforts on the ground bring neighbours together to forge bonds that can bind. Our emphasis on family seeks to help strengthen family bonds because that is where it all starts. Even our NS journey allows many to come together despite the differences in backgrounds. We all can do our part.It now leaves me to thank all Singaporeans – everyone here, those at the frontline, all those behind the scenes – who made this all possible.Passing Budget 2020 is only the first step.Let us go forth and translate these words into deeds.Because this is what our Democracy is all about.Because this is Singapore and because we are Singapore.Thank you. [Applause.]"

        "Content": "The Chairman: Head X – Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth. Dr Lim Wee Kiak.Providing Opportunities for AllDr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang): Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head X of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".Today, the global environment is more fractious and societies are increasingly polarised. Disruptive technologies are changing our economies, our jobs, our way of life and challenging our norms. Singapore is a global city state that is multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-religious and in some way multinational is at the epicentre of these forces. If we are not careful, these global forces can exert tensions that will threaten, disrupt and test the strength of the fabric of our society.While MCCY has done well in fostering a strong sense of national unity and pride through sectors of arts, youth, community and sports, new challenges such as the COVID-19, regional political turmoil and international trade tensions are always emerging and we must be prepared to remain resilient and stay united as one Singapore.MCCY must continue to strengthen the social fabric and the solidarity in the face of these forces. Are the current MCCY's strategies still relevant in the building an inclusive home where everyone feels that we are equal members of the same community, and are given equal opportunities to thrive and to pursue one's passion and interest? Given the increasing diversity and fractious state of our society, can we continue to progress together as a people?What unites us as one people, one nation? Is it the Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave when Singapore Lions beat Pahang during the 1994 Malaysian cup? Or the 50.39 secs that Joseph Schooling swam while we all held our breath in front of our TV screens during the 2016 Olympics? Or the nail-biting table tennis finals during the 2008 Olympics when our paddlers brought us a silver medal?We wept as a nation as we mourned together during the passing of our beloved founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 2015. People of all walks of life regarding of race, language or religion came together to queue for hours under the weather, rain or shine, day or night, to pay their last respect.We faced fear and death together during the 2003 SARS crisis which infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Today, we are again tested and challenged and tested with COVID-19. We are tackling these challenges together and collectively with resolute and resilience.As we continue to progress, the natural fault lines in our society – socio-economic divide, racial and religious divide, ideology divide, sexual orientation divide, e-literacy divide and many more – will continue to exist and may surface from time to time to threaten our resolve and unity. Will we be able to rise to the occasion like previous challenges and emerge stronger or will we be divided and withered?MCCY needs to intensify the efforts in building a home that provides opportunities for all. It is important while we embrace our diversity and differences as strength of our nation, we need to work hard to create and expand common spaces and experiences that is unique to Singapore. To do this, I have three suggestions.One, use arts, culture and heritage unique to Singapore. Make of arts and cultural programmes more accessible and affordable to Singaporeans. Similar to the $100 Active SG credits for sports facilities, MCCY can consider giving all Singaporeans $100 Active Arts and Culture credit to attend arts and cultural courses or attend local arts & cultural performances.Two, renew and remake of community clubs to remain relevant so that more Singaporeans will visit and use the CCs. Our CCs should be the Community Centre for arts, culture, wellness and health, social interactions and skills upgrading.Three, expand and build up community sports that can unite and bring people together. Top up the Active SG credits on a regular basis to promote community sports and expand the use of Active credits to sports events attendance, including our SG football leagues and national sports events.Chairman, building a home that provide opportunities for all is not just an ideal. It is a reality. It is a basic right for all Singaporeans. I would like to thank MCCY for their hard work and invite all Singaporeans from all walks of life to join MCCY to make this arduous task a reality.Question proposed.10.30 amThe Chairman: Mr Amrin Amin, please take your two cuts together.Support for YouthsThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin): Mr Chairman, in Malay, please.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Our youths play a vital role in developing our community. MENDAKI has focused its efforts on providing educational support for youths. Some of MENDAKI's programmes include the MENDAKI Tuition Scheme and the Future Ready programme. Emotional support is also important to prepare our youths for the future. How is MENDAKI supporting our youths in their emotional development?Building a Community of Success(In English): Next cut. Singaporean Muslims live in a diverse multi-racial community. We face unique challenges that are different from Muslim majority countries. Asatizah play a crucial role in guiding our community to live a rich and confident social religious life in a multi-religious Singapore.Our asatizah have a profound impact on the outlook of Singaporean Muslims including how we practise Islam and how we interact with people of different faith. Almost all our asatizah are trained overseas in Muslim majority countries. MUIS is developing Post-Graduate Certificate in Islam in Contemporary Societies to socialise our returning graduates to our local needs and context.Could the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs provide an update on this programme? How else is MUIS preparing our asatizah to guide Singaporean Muslim community to live in a multi-cultural modern society?Asatizah DevelopmentThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim): Mr Chairman, in Malay, please.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]To effectively guide the Muslim community who live in a multi-cultural society, the community depends on the asatizah to dispense religious knowledge that is based on lived reality and are able to address emerging issues, such as cryptocurrency and plant-based food.It is important that the asatizah are equipped with the necessary skills to engage the community effectively. How can our asatizah further engage and contribute to the community’s needs, beyond that of a religious teacher? Will MUIS provide assistance and support so that the asatizah are better equipped to contribute in the fields mentioned earlier?The Chairman: Mr Mohamed Irshad, take your two cuts together.Nurturing Inspiring Religious GraduatesMr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member): Chairman, for the first cut, I wish to congratulate the Committee on Future Asatizah or COFA, led by Senior Minister of State Dr Maliki Osman, for completing its work. In the report submitted to the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, COFA proposed a bold vision accompanied by 10 key recommendations based on three key thrusts. What can the asatizah fraternity expect from the recommendations?The Singapore Muslim community is a highly diverse one that speaks a multitude of languages. In addition to a significant number of Indian Muslims who speak a myriad of languages, there is a growing resident community of Muslims who speak Tagalog, Mandarin and other north Asian languages. We also have a large population of Muslim foreign workers who speak Bangla, Urdu and other South Asian languages.Since 1998, when the first MUIS scholarship was awarded, we have groomed a generation of Malay asatizah who are highly educated and doing some amazing work on the ground. I would like to ask the Minister if there are similar plans to build upon this foundation to groom a generation of non-Malay asatizah who can guide the local non-Malay Muslim communities?Uplifting the Asatizah WorkforceFor my second cut, Chairman, the Greek philosopher Heraclitus' statement \"Change is the only constant in life\" is applicable to all of us and all our situations without exception. For our respected asatizah fraternity, this statement is especially important as they have donned the robes of responsibility of guiding fellow Muslims in their faith.In order to be effective torchbearers and shepherds, our asatizah need to remain relevant by constantly updating themselves with knowledge, skill sets, contemporary issues, and even vocational skills.Sir, the recently submitted COFA report appears to have set a direction for tuture asatizah. I also note that the current generation of asatizah have the MUIS Academy which offers a range of courses and training as part of their lifelong learning ethos. There is also the SkillsFuture initiative for those asatizah who wish to acquire new skills.In order to benefit from these effectively, our asatizah need to be more aware of the competencies they ought to possess. This will then enable them to make informed choices about improving themselves. Can the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs share how MUIS will support the asatizah in this regard and the competencies they should acquire in order to stay relevant?Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol): Chairman, in Malay, please.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Asatizah play an important role today in guiding the Singaporean Muslim community to help us thrive in a multi-religious and multi-cultural society, as well as globally, in addition to upholding our religious values.MUIS will also focus on efforts to enhance the professional development of our asatizah.There are many ways for an ustaz or usatazah to contribute to society, but one of the common grouses amongst this group is that this sector appears to have limited employment opportunities.What has MUIS done to ensure that the religious sector can become an attractive sector for employment, especially for the talented ones who can make good contributions?It was also reported that a revision will be made to asatizah's wages. What are the strategies that our community will support in order to ensure that our asatizah’s wages are aligned to market rates?The Chairman: Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap, you take your two cuts together.Muslim MarriagesMr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied): Chairman, Sir, in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Sir, I would like to ask the Minister how many applications were received by the Syariah Court of Singapore for; firstly divorces, and second, obtaining counselling, between 2017 to 2019. And from these applications, how many applicants eventually divorced.Second, I hope that the Minister can also share three main reasons or factors that are the causes of divorce in the Malay/Muslim community in Singapore within the time period I mentioned earlier.Sir, The Registry of Muslim Marriages (ROMM) launched the \"Bersamamu\" programme in May 2019. This programme aims to provide holistic support to Muslim couples before and after marriage.I would like to seek an update on this programme from the Minister.MUIS Appeal Board(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]I would like to get the following facts from the Minister. How many appeal cases does the MUIS Appeal Board receive annually in relation to the decisions of the Syariah Court of Singapore for divorce cases in 2017, 2018 and 2019, and what are the main reasons for these appeals?From this number of appeal cases that were reported, how many cases were reported by the ex-husband and how many by the ex-wife?Sir, in my four years as a counsellor handling counselling sessions for the Syariah Court's Marriage Counselling Programme (MCP), I received feedback from some husbands as well as ex-husbands who felt that the Syariah Court seem to place emphasis on the Women's Charter in their deliberation process when making a judgment. In fact, until today, I still receive similar feedback from time to time from some of my residents as well as the public.Sir, may I seek the Minister’s view and clarifications on this issue?The Chairman: Mr Saktiandi Supaat, take your two cuts, please.Pre-school Education for Malay/Muslim ChildrenMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Chairman, in Malay, please.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Preschool education plays an important role in the early years for better development and learning in the later stages of life. In the last few years, there has been a growing emphasis on preschool education.The Early Childhood Development Agency has been pushing for more children to attend pre-school regularly so that they will not fall behind in their studies compared to their peers when they enter primary school. This is because the early years of childhood are important towards shaping social and communication skills as well as attitudes towards learning. It is a platform to give all children an equal start in life regardless of their backgrounds.How is MENDAKI supporting preschool learning for the Malay/Muslim community to ensure that our children have access to quality education and other learning opportunities?MENDAKI's Support for Career Mobility(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]MENDAKI has been playing a crucial role in supporting career mobility among the Malay/Muslim community. Last year, MENDAKI held its first Raikan Ilmu (Celebrate Knowledge) campaign, which celebrates the diverse bodies of knowledge in our society. The campaign saw activities that encouraged both children and adults to explore knowledge in new areas such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics. I was very impressed by it and I hope to see further extensions of it soon. Such campaigns are important and engaging reminders to the community to be open to learning new skills, especially in today’s economy where the rapid pace of growth has disrupted traditional industries and business models.Can Minister share how will MENDAKI continue to support and encourage the community to explore and gain competencies in new skills, so that they can remain relevant and have the confidence to seek employment in new industries?Nurturing Asatizah for the CommunityMs Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong): Chairman, in Malay, please.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]I had the opportunity to speak to several groups of asatizah at dialogue sessions organised by Berita Harian last year. In the discussions with them, one of the issues raised was the challenges faced by the asatizah when they perform their duties to educate and provide guidance to the community. Among other things, the asatizah shared that our community members approach them to ask about new issues that they face, and therefore, the asatizah must have knowledge and a fresh approach to manage such issues.Our living environment has certainly changed. The Malay/Muslim community needs to adapt religion within a new context that is different from the context long ago. From the way we connect in the cyber world, to the way we do business, to our medical treatments; much has changed. For example, MUIS has produced a compilation of fatwas (Islamic legal ruling) on issues related to science, medicine and health. There have been many new scientific procedures and developments, and our community requires proper guidance. What is certain is that, with rapid global developments, there will always be new issues that our community must face.Due to the ever changing needs of the community, our asatizah must also be equipped with the relevant knowledge to manage current issues. Our young asatizah must have a very strong foundation in Islamic education as well as other relevant fields such as science and technology. We must begin preparations as early as primary school. We must develop a younger generation that is well-versed and comfortable with current issues so that they are able to handle future challenges. They may also join other fields apart from Islamic education and therefore they should be prepared. Investment on our madrasah students’ development is highly important.I would therefore like to ask what are MUIS' plans to ensure that our madrasahs have the resources and capabilities to fulfil the developmental needs of students in current and new fields?Managing Diversity in Muslim CommunityMr Mohamed Irshad: Chairman, as I previously mentioned in the House, the Singapore Muslim community is a highly diverse one. In addition to the racial diversity, we have Muslims from all around the world coming to study, work, marry and settle in Singapore. Like a garden of flowers, this diversity adds to the beauty and richness of the Singapore Muslim Community, in particular, the Singapore society at large.Sir, it is vital that these Muslim foreign workers, expatriates, migrants are able to intermingle seamlessly with the larger body of resident Muslims, so that they do not end up creating inward-looking enclaves.We have seen the introduction of Friday sermons being translated and at times being delivered in English and other languages. In addition to this. I would like to ask the Minister what efforts are being undertaken to reach out to these groups of Muslims, so that they are better integrated with fellow Muslims in Singapore and the wider Singaporean community, and that they are aligned with our Singapore Muslim identity and values.Singapore Together–Partnering the CommunityMr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol): Mr Chairman, in Malay, please.10.45 am(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]The 4G leadership recently expressed the Government’s strong commitment to partner Singaporeans of all races, cultures and religions, and working together with them in nation-building.For the Malay/Muslim community especially, what are the new methods of engagement in which the Government is prepared to partner the Malay/Muslim community to co-create and collaborate in co-solutioning for issues faced by our community?Minister had also mentioned about M3 launching a new series of dialogues, Ciptasama, this year. Could the Minister elaborate on the aim of Ciptasama, and provide us with an update on the engagements with our community so far?MENDAKI's End-to-end Education SupportDr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio): In Malay, please, Chairman.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]In recent years, there have been many changes to the education system and landscape in Singapore. Some of the changes include an increased number of places for Direct School Admission (DSA), Subject-Based Banding (SBB) in lieu of streaming, the removal of mid-year and year-end examinations for Primary 1 and 2 students, changes to the Primary School Leaving Examinations grade banding, and work readiness initiatives in post-secondary institutions.Prior to this, most of MENDAKI's programmes and initiatives often focus on academic excellence and this has resulted in an increase in post-secondary passes, scholarship holders and white collar workers in our community. Now, with a shift towards providing education with multiple pathways to success that is not solely based on academic excellence, as well as collaborations with the industries to ensure work readiness and lifelong learning, MENDAKI's programmes, initiatives and approach must also transform so as to remain relevant.In light of these changes to our education system and landscape as well as schools, what are MENDAKI's plans and progress in reviewing its education programs so as to be in line with these changes that were made to our education system and schools, to ensure that relevant and useful support is given to our community?I would also like to ask the Minister for an update on whether MENDAKI has plans to venture into the pre-school sector as well, and whether Mendaki will implement initiatives or programs for this sector, in light of the rapid changes to the pre-school sector in recent years.The Chairman: Minister Masagos.The Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M): Mr Chairman, last year, during my Hari Raya speech, I said that our Malay/Muslim community is a Community of Success, or in Malay, Masyarakat Gemilang.While we are part of the Malay diaspora in the region, there are three things that make our community unique – character, competence and citizenry, or what I call the 3Cs. The first \"C\", character, is about the outlook of the community and the values that it cherishes. The second \"C\", competence, is self-explanatory. We cannot be successful if we are liabilities. The third and final \"C\" is citizenry, a sense of responsibility towards nation-building and society. We cannot be satisfied merely with being equal in rights, we must also be equal in substance as citizens. Singapore is our home and we have a duty to it.Mr Chairman, in the midst of our fight against COVID-19, I want to start by talking about citizenry. In a number of dialogues with the community, we received feedback that the community is happy with the support that the Government is extending to citizens in response to COVID-19. I am happier to see that the community is contributing where it can in the fight against the virus, not just happily receiving help.For example, Masjid Assyakirin teamed up with Bo Tien Temple, representatives of the Baha'i faith, the Calvary Bible-Presbyterian Church and Jurong Christian Church to prepare lunch boxes and notes of appreciation for healthcare workers in Jurong Polyclinic. In support of their initiative, Al Ayza Restaurant sponsored half the food and helped with delivery. Other Muslim-owned restaurants, such as Kinamaya, Rumah Makan Minang, Hajjah Maimunah Restaurant and Positano Risto, also stepped up. They teamed up with the riders of Dadah Itu Haram, who delivered the food to frontline healthcare workers in Singapore General Hospital.Over the past week, MUIS raised money in the mosques to contribute to the Courage Fund. Mendaki, too, organised a walk to raise funds. MESRA Youths made and distributed 1,000 ribbon flowers to our frontliners to tell them – we remember you.Many Malay/Muslims have been at the frontline in the healthcare sector, home team and even the passenger transport sector. I am proud they are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with fellow Singaporeans in this fight. During this crisis, we see that citizenry is genuinely demonstrated.Standing bravely at the frontline and stepping forward to help, exemplify character, the second \"C\" and one of the three qualities that our community wants to be known for. As Muslims, character is closely intertwined with our religion, culture and therefore our identity. There are many minority Muslim communities around the world that struggle with the practice of Islam in secular jurisdictions, multicultural societies and against contemporary challenges. In Singapore, we are fortunate to have a strong fraternity of asatizah, who are also fellow Singaporeans and their guidance has made all the difference for our community.Our asatizah bear significant responsibility in guiding the community on how to thrive in our multicultural society, live in harmony with others and navigate contemporary and future challenges. This is why we formed the Committee on Future Asatizah (COFA) last year, to better understand what our community would like to see in our asatizah, and in turn, how we can better support the asatizah fraternity.After extensive engagements, COFA found that the community would like to our asatizah to guide them on issues of the modern world and to see them connecting with other communities to build a cohesive society and contribute to Singapore. My colleague, Senior Minister of State Maliki, will elaborate further on what we intend to do with COFA's recommendations.I agree with Senior Parliamentary Secretary Amrin Amin, who spoke about the importance of being able to address Muslims who live in our multicultural society. And as Mr Irshad said, there is diversity not just in our society, but also within our community. We can look into grooming more religious leaders who can engage in various languages.MUIS will also work with our asatizah to develop a body of knowledge and practice to guide Muslim life in multicultural societies. Singapore is not alone in this challenge. There are other minority Muslim communities around the world that share our belief that Muslims can thrive in plural societies. We want to learn from these communities, we want to learn from each other and this is why MUIS will organise an International Conference on Communities of Success later this year.We must also re-think the role of asatizah. Over the past two years, the work of M3has shown us that asatizah are well-placed to provide spiritual guidance and support in various facets of Muslim life, beyond the mosque and the madrasah. They can provide pastoral care to the incarcerated, the sick and the aged. They can be spiritual guides to couples, whether they are trying to build a new family or overcoming trials and tribulations to preserve the home.Mr Faisal Manap asked how the Syariah Court has handled the divorce cases that has come before it. In my view, the more pertinent issue is to work with the community upstream in strengthening families and preventing divorces. Through M3flagship programmes like Bersamamu and FITRAH, our asatizah volunteers have helped close to 3,000 soon-to-wed couples as well as 40 families where at least one parent is incarcerated.There are many ways an ustaz or ustazah can contribute. The Muslim community needs religious curriculum developers for our madrasahs, specialists to administer religious programmes in MUIS, ROMM and our mosques and jurists to support our Syariah Court and Fatwa Committee. These institutions need able asatizah.Importantly, we need asatizah who do not shy away from grappling with contemporary issues. As a Muslim Singaporean, I feel proud that our asatizah have risen to the occasion. For example, when NEWater was introduced, our asatizah sought to understand the water technology used and were quick to recognise that the end-product was clean and that means, also Halal.Such clear-minded, progressive thinking is even more important in exceptional times, like now. To minimise the risk of transmitting COVID-19, our asatizah gave guidance on bringing our own mats when we pray in the mosque and refraining from shaking hands for now. Singapore is probably the only place in the world where Muslim religious leaders give practical, medically-sound advice with such speed.If we can train and enable more asatizah to support our community in these ways, our community will be better for it. The job of an ustaz is not easy. To perform his job well, an ustaz must not only be well-versed in Islamic knowledge, but also be au fait with psychology, sociology, social work, comparative law, science and technology and more.As several of our Members of Parliaments pointed out, we must support our asatizah in this journey. We are therefore making an investment not only in asatizah training but also to transform the formal religious sector. To facilitate this transformation, MUIS has developed the Asatizah Workforce Development Plan (AWDP), on which Senior Minister of State Maliki will elaborate later.Mr Chairman, how effective our asatizah are in nurturing the character of our community therefore hinges on their competence. But for our community to succeed, we must also encourage every Muslim to aspire towards excellence and contribute to the community and Singapore. Inasmuch as the camaraderie amongst our healthcare workers and home-team members matters, it is also their competence that earned them the trust of Singaporeans in the fight against COVID-19.As a community, we have come a long way. In 1980, only 16% of Malay/Muslim students achieved five GCE \"O\" level passes. We marshalled community resources to form MENDAKI, which then worked with MOE as a partner to develop a support system for Malay/Muslim students. By the end of the decade, we doubled the proportion of Malay/Muslim students who achieved five GCE \"O\" Level Passes. Today, this proportion is four times that in 1980. Last year, our students outperformed their OECD peers in Mathematics and have made substantial improvements in reading.Today, nine in 10 of Malay/Muslim students in a P1 cohort make it to University, Polytechnic, ITE or other post-Secondary education institutes. As we move forward, we must try to make sure that all our students are able to acquire at least a Nitec – this is the \"red-line\" that MENDAKI must ensure no one falls below. Concurrently, we must grow the numbers of our youth who can graduate with a University degree. During my Hari Raya speech, I called this our \"blue line\" and MENDAKI must help as many as possible across it.The truth is, addressing dropouts and failure rates are already problems of yesterday. We need to prepare our young for a tomorrow that will be challenging and volatile. In today's economy, ITE, Polytechnic and University qualifications are merely hygiene factors. MENDAKI's efforts are only as good as it keeps pace with the changing educational, social and economic landscape.Thus, we have started a comprehensive review of MENDAKI's policies and programmes, to ensure that MENDAKI can be an effective partner to MOE and our educational institutes. Beyond that, there must be an equal emphasis on lifelong learning in our community, much like in the past, when we emphasised the importance of educating our children well.We cannot just be focused on tax-rebate vouchers to manage today'scost of living. Our community must also take advantage of other forms of support like the SkillsFuture Credit, to acquire new competencies and qualifications for better-paying jobs, especially when their current skills run the risk of being irrelevant in the near future.The same applies to Malay/Muslim SMEs and funding support for digitalisation and venturing overseas for them to grow. Minister of State Zaqy will speak on the shifts MENDAKI will be making and how we are encouraging lifelong learning. Mr Chairman, allow me to conclude in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Our community can do more to contribute in various areas and sectors. Many initiatives have been rolled out by our volunteers at M³@Towns with the close cooperation of MUIS, MENDAKI and MESRA. In line with this measure, a series of conversations called CiptaSama@M³, was formed to hear the views of the Malay/Muslim community on national issues that are of greatest concern to them and to co-create solutions that can be implemented so that we can prosper together as a nation. We have started the conversation with the leaders and volunteers of the M³@Towns and we look forward to engaging members of the community from all walks of lives in the coming months.In building a Community of Success, we must continue to uphold the three key values of the community – Character, Competence and Citizenry. As our asatizah shape the community’s character and identity, we must be committed in our investment to enhance our asatizah’s competencies.We will also invest in the future of our children and youth by providing educational support to develop a future generation that is competent and capable in contributing back to society. And we are determined to work together with the Malay/Muslim community, not just to build a Community of Success, but also to build a prosperous future together for Singapore.11.00 amThe Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman): Mr Chairman, our asatizah anchor our community to values and traditions in a rapidly evolving world. Increasingly, they are expected to dispense religious guidance on matters not limited to faith and rituals, but also on finance and estate matters, science, medicine and family.Socio-religious issues are becoming more complex. Bio-scientific developments pose new ethical questions. Demographic shifts, such as an ageing population, evolving concepts of gender roles and challenges brought forth with the Internet of Things, require clearer religious guidance.In March 2019, we formed the Committee on Future Asatizah (COFA) and I led the engagements on the vision for future asatizah. COFA members included representatives from the asatizah fraternity, Malay/Muslim community leaders, professionals and academics from different fields. The diversity reflects the expanded role expected of future asatizah. We held 16 engagements sessions over nine months, involving over 1,900 stakeholders. These engagement platforms include focus group discussions, round tables, online surveys, street surveys and interviews. COFA concluded its deliberations with the following vision for future asatizah:(a) As religious leaders in a multi-cultural and diverse society, our asatizah must proactively engage on issues of the modern world and connect with other communities to build a cohesive Singapore society.(b) As professionals, our asatizah are advocates of lifelong learning, acquiring new knowledge and skills in guiding Singapore Muslims to respond to contemporary challenges.(c) As role models, our asatizah are rooted to Islamic traditions, resilient, adaptable, compassionate, driven and committed to the betterment of Singapore society.COFA proposed to realise the vision through three strategic thrusts: first, we will professionalise the asatizah sector; second, we will strengthen key religious institutions; and third, we will do more to nurture inspiring asatizah.First, on professionalising the asatizah sector. Today, a significant proportion of jobs in the religious sector are unstructured and, as Mr Zainal Sapari highlighted, this results in limited opportunities to progress. To transform and professionalise the sector, I am glad to share that MUIS is developing an Asatizah Workforce Development Plan (AWDP) to enhance the attractiveness of the religious sector and the skills and competencies of our asatizah.This year, asatizah can look forward to the first initiative under AWDP, which is the Career and Competency Framework (CCF). This framework articulates the different roles and pathways within the formal religious sector and provides information on the respective skillsets needed. With this framework, asatizah can better plan their careers and proactively learn about skills and competencies required for the various career pathways.In the next three years, MUIS will develop more initiatives under the AWDP. This includes salary guidelines, a religious talent programme to identify and develop future religious leaders and more opportunities for skills upgrading. The religious talent programme, like the Muis scholarship that Mr Irshad mentioned, will be open to deserving applicants on the basis of merit, regardless of race.For asatizah who are interested to upgrade themselves on emerging issues, Muis will organise relevant courses on digitalisation and the use of social media. Lifelong learning is crucial and critical for all Singaporeans who want to stay relevant, and our asatizah are no exception. The top-up to their Skills Future Credit announced in Budget 2020 will be an additional boost for them to explore new frontiers of skills and opportunities.The second strategic thrust is strengthening institutions. As we nurture a stronger, more adaptable asatizah workforce, it is also important to strengthen religious institutions. I agree with Mdm Rahayu Mahzam that madrasahs play an important role in developing future asatizah. MUIS has been working closely with our madrasahs to support the development of teachers, improve programmes and curriculum and enhance the facilities of madrasahs. For example, Madrasah Al-Arabiah has a new campus. The campus is equipped with better lab facilities and resources for students, so that our young asatizah can build a strong foundation in both religious and secular subjects.The Registry of Muslim Marriages (ROMM) and Syariah Court also play key roles in the lives of Singaporean Muslims. While overseeing the registration and solemnisation of marriage and managing divorces will remain their core roles, these institutions can play a bigger part in shaping community life. For example, to further enhance Bersamamu, ROMM has been working closely with MSF to train Kadis and Naib Kadis to better engage and support soon-to-wed couples. Thus far, Bersamamu has benefited close to 3,000 couples since its launch in July 2019.The third strategic thrust is to nurture inspiring asatizah. COFA saw potential for asatizah to contribute to adjacent sectors, such as social work, and to provide Singaporean Muslims with advice on how to navigate contemporary developments in the use of technology and finance. To help our asatizah step up to this role, the Postgraduate Certificate in Islam in Contemporary Societies (PCICS) will also expose them to social sciences, develop counselling, social work and other vocational skills to prepare them for an exciting and promising future. In addition to partnerships with renowned Islamic institutions like Al-Azhar University and the University of Jordan and our local publicly-funded Universities like NUS and SUSS, PCICS will include a practicum component to equip students with on-the-job training, exposure and experiential learning for their future roles in the workforce.Mr Chairman, allow me to continue in Malay, please.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Our asatizah shape the character of our community. This is an important responsibility. The role of an asatizah has evolved from only functioning as religious teachers to religious leaders who contribute their expertise in the religious and non-religious sectors. Our long-term vision is to develop our future cohorts of asatizah as religious thought leaders who are highly regarded locally and internationally.(In English): Mr Chairman, our young asatizah can be great assets to the community, beyond the mosque and the madrasah. We must continue to invest in their development. In turn, I hope that our young aspiring asatizah will rise to the occasion, be the confident guides that the community needs to navigate future challenges and contribute to the vision of a Muslim community of success and help us build a strong and cohesive Singapore.The Minister of State for Manpower and National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad): Mr Chairman, let me touch on our efforts to strengthen our community’s competencies through MENDAKI. There are three drivers in today’s education landscape to provide the impetus for transforming MENDAKI.First, good pre-school education is critical to the development of our children. Every child should have access to this, regardless of background.Second, as Dr Intan Mokhtar has highlighted, our education approach in schools is changing and MOE is catering for greater flexibility in education for students with different abilities and interests.Third, in a fast-changing world, lifelong learning is a must.Sir, in response to these changes, MENDAKI will enhance its mission to provide end-to-end educational support for our Malay/Muslim community. As Minister Masagos has mentioned, the community has shown significant progress in school dropout and failure rates. We can now focus on new challenges to take the community forward.Completing school today is not enough. We want our children to succeed in school and be equipped to achieve successful careers.Dr Intan and Mr Saktiandi asked about our plans to support the pre-school sector. For our young children, we want to equip them with a strong foundation so that they can achieve in life. While initiatives, such as the Preschool Outreach Programme, have paid off, there are vulnerable families in our community who need extra support. Thus, MENDAKI and MUIS have set up the MENDAKI MUIS Preschool Grant (MMPG) which builds on existing Government initiatives to provide additional financial support for our low-income parents.Sir, with MMPG established in January this year, beneficiaries can see a quadrupling of their CDA savings. For example, if you put just $1 a day in your child’s CDA account, you will have $30 in a month. MMPG will double that amount to $60 and the Government’s CDA co-matching initiative will double the $60 to $120 a month. The money can then be used to pay for your child’s education and medical needs. So, contribute $1 and you get another $3 to support your child.On the academic front, MENDAKI also started moving to pre-school last year with KelasMateMatika(KMM)@CC with the support of our M3partners for Malay pre-schoolers. This programme reinforces basic numeracy skills and help parents to be more involved in their children’s development. Last year, more than 1,200 children and parents benefited from KMM.Over 90% of parents who attended KMM said that they now recognise the importance of pre-school education and are confident on how to develop their children’s numeracy skills. MENDAKI is planning to scale up KMM to benefit more families this year.As our children progress into schools, MENDAKI Tuition Scheme (MTS) and MOE's UPLIFT programme step in to help those who need extra coaching and motivation to attend school more regularly. This year, so far, more than 7,500 students have enrolled in our 85 MTS centres. By next year, we intend to introduce 15 more centres to make it 100.The academic performance of our MTS students has been encouraging. In 2018, 60% of MTS students who took Standard Mathematics achieved at least one grade performance in their PSLE result, compared to their year-end result the previous year.However, like Dr Intan said, we recognise the need to improve MTS, given our evolving education landscape. This is why MENDAKI will review the MTS in five areas: (a) governance and leadership; (b) curriculum; (c) pedagogy; (d) professional development of our tutors; as well as (e) outreach.Beyond educational support, I agree with Mr Amrin Amin that it is also important to provide emotional support and career guidance for our youths. With the support of other M3agencies, MENDAKI has set up a Youth Mentoring Office (YMO) to grow a culture of mentoring in the community. We now have over 700 volunteer mentors and 200 of them are already on the ground to support our work with the community.A key aspect of the Budget this year was about supporting Singaporeans in lifelong learning. The ability to upskill, adapt to industry shifts and be ready for new opportunities is key to staying relevant. Mr Saktiandi asked how MENDAKI will be supporting the community in this area.We want to encourage our adults to take up various initiatives to support their learning, such as the SkillsFuture Credit top-up announced in Budget 2020. This is especially useful for our mature workers who are looking to improve their career prospects.MENDAKI SENSE will continue to guide jobseekers and workers on how to make full use of these opportunities provided by the Government so that they can access desired jobs. MENDAKI SENSE has also helped over 2,000 Malay jobseekers who come to its doors to find employment through their programmes in the last five years and we will continue to strengthen its efforts.Sir, this year, Bulan Raikan Ilmu will continue to champion Lifelong Learning. Our first Raikan Ilmu month reached out to about 30,000 participants and we hope to further our outreach to 40,000 this year.Mr Chairman, allow me to conclude in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]We are committed to providing end-to-end support, at every stage of life, for our community. MENDAKI is enhancing their initiatives in response to the changing education and employment landscape.This starts from efforts that encourage the learning and development of young children, to supporting the aspirations of youths, and building a culture of lifelong learning for adults. In turn, we hope that the community recognises the importance of enhancing our educational standards and embracing the spirit of lifelong learning.Come, let us double our efforts to become a highly competent community and continue to contribute to the success of Singapore.11.45 amThe Chairman: Clarifications, if any. Mr Saktiandi Supaat.Mr Saktiandi Supaat: Chairman, I have two clarifications. Can I ask the questions in Malay?(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]I would like to ask the Minister or Minister of State whether they can provide more information about the MUIS-MENDAKI Preschool Grant (MMPG). I welcome the support that will be given to Singaporeans. How will it benefit low-income Malay/Muslims families? More importantly, how can they apply for the grant? Can details be given, if available?Second, what will the Youth Mentoring Office (YMO), that Minister of State mentioned earlier, do for Malay/Muslim youths in Singapore?Mr Zaqy Mohamad(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.] Thank you for those questions. MMPG will help families with children who are six years old and below. The grant can be used to quadruple their CDA savings. This money can be used for the pre-school fees, medical expenses, enrichment programmes and even prescriptive glasses for their children. Therefore, for Malay/Muslim families with a per capita income (PCI) of $650 and families with children who are six years old and below, they can apply through MENDAKI.As for the second question – YMO was set up by MENDAKI, with the support of M3, to grow a strong culture of mentoring within our community. Its objective is to provide career guidance which is a key aspect of this mentoring project. It provides useful guidance for our youths especially those who want to pursue a career in new areas like AI, cybersecurity and others. Although there are good career prospects in these areas, they may not know any role models who can help them to explore these pathways. So, we hope that, with this Youth Mentoring Office programme, we can help them to find jobs and careers in new areas.The Chairman: Dr Intan.Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar: Chairman, in Malay, please.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Minister or Minister of State Zaqy, what are the plans for MENDAKI's Tuition Scheme to ensure that our children are ready for a more dynamic environment and also to seize opportunities to excel in various areas apart from academic excellence?Mr Zaqy Mohamad(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Thank you, Dr Intan. Firstly, MENDAKI conducted a review last year. From there, we obtained all kinds of feedback from the community and we have revamped our programmes. We will restructure the MTS centres and introduce Cluster Principals. This will further strengthen the leadership and administration of these centres.Second, we will also update the MTS curriculum and introduce the Science subject to Primary 3 students instead of Primary 4 currently.Third, MENDAKI will also make pedagogical changes to further improve our children’s experience at the MTS.For Primary 1 to 3 students, MENDAKI will explore various learning techniques, including experiential learning or modular learning outside the classroom. Hence, learning should not only be conducted in the classroom but also outside the classroom. This will transform our children’s learning experience.For Secondary school students, MENDAKI will introduce Subject-Based Banding. Therefore, we will be aligned with MOE by transforming the way we provide support, which will be tailored to our children's abilities.To help students who require more guidance, MENDAKI will upgrade its intensive guidance programmes that it piloted last year. The results of this pilot programme has been encouraging so far. MENDAKI will also look into the professional development of its 830 MTS tutors and also explore ways to empower parents so that they can be more involved in giving motivation and support to their children.Lastly, MTS will further enhance its outreach strategy to engage students who need more support and this includes strengthening MENDAKI's involvement in schools with a percentage of Malay/Muslim students who are not performing.MENDAKI will collaborate with MOE in the UPLIFT programme so that more of our students who need academic support will receive a more comprehensive assistance. By 2021, MENDAKI hopes to work with 15 more schools so that we can increase the number of MTS centres to 100.The Chairman: Mr Zainal Sapari.Mr Zainal Sapari: Chairman, in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]So far, there has been no cases of COVID-19 that came from the mosques in Singapore, even though many Muslims of different nationalities visit the mosque daily to perform congregational prayers. Can the Minister share what steps have been taken by MUIS and the mosques to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infection among mosque congregants so that everyone can pray safely and peacefully?Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Mr Chairman, in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Thank you, Mr Zainal, for the question on COVID-19, especially in relation to our community. Obviously, when we congregate, for example, in mosques or during festivities, infections can occur. At the mosques, for instance, we will shake hands with each other. Sometimes, we hug each other. In the past, our ladies used the praying veils provided by the mosques. Or our foreheads will touch the mosque’s carpeted floor during prayers.MUIS and the Mufti have given guidance so that we can momentarily change our normal practice. For instance, please bring our own prayer mats to use during prayers because COVID-19 can be spread when someone coughs on the same carpeted floor that come into contact with our foreheads during prayers.We can also cut down on handshakes. If we want to shake hands, make sure that we have washed our hands first with soap, and after shaking hands, wash them again. But I think if we are often seen washing our hands every time we shake hands, we will perhaps be seen as being disrespectful. So, my suggestion is to greet each other this way (Minister places his hand on his chest) while we deal with this COVID-19 situation.But in time to come, as I said earlier, we must also further improve our level of hygiene, personally and for the individual, so that we take care of our health as well as our loved ones’ health. This is how we manage the COVID-19 issue for the long-term.The Chairman: Any more clarifications? Next cut. Mr Darryl David.Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio): Mr Chairman, I have three cuts, may I take them together?The Chairman: Yes, please. Take your three cuts together.Opportunities for Children and YouthsMr Darryl David: Mr Chairman, our children are our country's future. The environment that our children are living in and growing up with is very different from ours, as will be case from generation to generation.But the world today is economically more uncertain and is more polarised and fragmented with opposing camps holding deep, uncompromising views. Disruptions, dis-intermediation and shifting of economic powers globally have threatened the existing world order and has triggered the competition for hegemony among global nations.Our children and youth have a stake in Singapore's future as influencers for change. As the Government, we must ensure that we provide opportunities for our children and youth to grow and develop holistically. How is MCCY supporting equal opportunities and holistic development for our children and youths?Arts and sports, for instance, are crucial ways to nurture the young. And studies have shown that participation in arts and sports can bring about positive cognitive, behavioural and social outcomes. How will MCCY ensure that all children and youth, regardless of their background and ability, have access to arts and sports opportunities?As our youths enter the workforce, we must also ensure that they are equipped with the skills and knowledge to thrive, especially when the future of work has yet to be defined. How can MCCY work with the other relevant Ministries to ensure that we prepare our youth adequately for future workforce challenges?Preserving Our Cultural HeritageSecond cut, please. In 2015, the Singapore Botanic Gardens was successfully inscribed as Singapore's first UNESCO World Heritage Site and in 2019, we submitted the nomination documents to have \"Hawker Culture in Singapore: Community Dining and Culinary Practices in a Multicultural Urban Context\" on the UNESCO's Representative List.Mr Chairman, culture is a way of life. It is the social glue that binds different communities together. It creates shared beliefs among people and a common identity that helps define the character of the nation. And in many ways, the Botanic Gardens and our hawker food are part of our cultural and national identity. We grew up with hawker food and everyone has our own favourite hawker stalls and, of course, we would always remember strolling through the Botanic Gardens with our loved ones. Some of us here in the House might even remember strolling through the Botanic Gardens and then going to the hawker centre across the road for some excellent murtabak, dessert and drinks.Yet, culture is not only defined by UNESCO titles, neither can culture be created by attaching labels to empty physical spaces. Culture exists only when people attach special meaning and importance to places or to practices, and only when places and practices hold personal memories to people. So, the places where we live, work and play hold many memories about our traditions and way of life, which make us uniquely Singapore.Mr Chairman, Singapore's cultural heritage belongs to us all. Singapore is a multi-ethnic and multi-racial society. The different communities living and working in Singapore are all part of our cultural fabric and the different communities need to define for themselves what is culturally important to them, while also celebrating the aspects of other communities. That is what makes Singapore special. As the Government, we need to empower our community stakeholders to celebrate their heritage, promote their heritage in everyday spaces, and more importantly, facilitate its transmission to the next generation.Can MCCY share how it intends to continue to engage the community to sustain interest in, and deepen appreciation for Singapore's cultural heritage?High Performance SportsMy final cut, Mr Chairman. The 2019 SEA Games was a mixed-bag of results for Team Singapore. While we had a number of hits, such as winning our first-ever gold in softball and making a clean gold medal sweep in underwater hockey, we also had a number of misses. For the first time in 50 years, we did not win a gold for water-polo and did not do as well as we thought we would in women's table tennis doubles.With less than five months to go before the Tokyo Olympics, can MCCY provide an update on how Team Singapore athletes, especially the up and coming ones, are faring regionally and internationally?Mr Chairman, the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 and the high rates of infection in Japan have also thrown a bit of a spanner in the works. There is the possibility of COVID-19 being declared as a global pandemic and there is thus the possibility of the Tokyo Olympics being significantly affected by this as well.How is MCCY supporting Team Singapore's preparation in the lead up to the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics? And how does MCCY plan to support Team Singapore athletes if they were to compete in a host-country where the rate of COVID-19 infection is high?SG Youth Action PlanMr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee): Last year, the Ministry and the National Youth Council (NYC) launched the SG Youth Action Plan, an ambitious effort to envision the future of Singapore in 2025 and provide a platform for Singapore's youths to shape their vision for the country, develop plans for youth, community organisations, businesses and the Government to realise this vision together.With the kick-off in May 2019, can the Ministry provide a progress update on the discussions so far? What are the aspirations and ideas from our youth, resulting from this engagement and what can youths look forward to in 2020 and beyond?The transformation of the Somerset Belt designated as an area with a strong youth focus as part of the longer term plans for Orchard Road is also a key project under the SG Youth Action Plan. What has been the progress of discussions and how will the slowdown in the economy impact its development?Support for Ground-up PartnershipsMr Saktiandi Supaat: Mr Chairman, at Budget 2016, the Government introduced Our Singapore Fund to encourage and support active citizens that are taking the initiative to solve ground problems, strengthen community spirit and contribute to nation-building.11.30 amIt is gratifying to note that in the recent years, more Singaporeans, particularly youths, have been coming together to form ground-up initiatives ranging from upcycling to urban farming to evolving traditional arts and so on.What is the status of the Fund? How many benefited from it? Will MCCY continue to support these ground-up initiatives through Our Singapore Fund? Besides enabling ground-up initiatives, how is MCCY supporting the Government’s efforts to partner Singaporeans in shaping our future Singapore together?SG Cares Volunteer CentresVolunteers play an important role alongside social service professionals to shore up the social safety networks and reduce the number of cases of people falling through the cracks. But, of course, volunteer work can be a lot more than helping the needy. Volunteers are also needed to run community gardens, do befriending, look out for the interests of the environment and wildlife, and so on. In short, they are crucial towards building up the resilience of a nation through encouraging cohesion and compassion.During COVID-19, we saw how volunteers are playing crucial roles in facilitating mask distribution efforts, including that in Toa Payoh, and ensuring attendees of community events partake in hygiene measures as well.Last year, MCCY rolled out SG Cares Volunteer Centres in seven towns to grow and coordinate volunteer supply, facilitate partnerships between community partners and build capabilities in these towns. Can the Ministry provide an update on these Volunteer Centres, and whether there are plans to roll out more Centres to more towns?The Chairman: Mr Henry Kwek, take your two cuts, please.Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon): Sir, my first cut. Singapore’s caring and kindness, along with progress in our society’s civic, culture, and sports arena, are fuelled by the passion of our country’s volunteers. MCCY has done an excellent job to identify, nurture, and empower them. We need to look no further than Team Nile, our Museum Volunteers. MCCY also rolled out an excellent cloud-base volunteer portal, Volunteer.sg, that is a game-changer on how VWOs engage volunteers. I am deeply appreciative that MCCY has included Kebun Baru as a pilot within PA.Last year, MCCY rolled out Volunteer Centres in seven towns to grow and coordinate volunteer supply, facilitate partnerships between community partners and build capabilities in these towns. Can the Ministry provide an update on these Volunteer Centres, and whether there are plans to roll out the Centres to more towns?Additional Support by MCCY and NACMy second cut. Most arts and culture institutions rely on a combination of ticket sales, grants, donations and endowment income. For those with NAC grants, the Government usually ties the grants to public attendances and projects that benefit Singapore, and rightfully so.In view of the current circumstances regarding COVID-19, donations from some parts of the business community may be down and there can be reduced demand for large scale public performances.Some institutions without deep reserves or large endowment could face significant challenges.Can MCCY share how MCCY and NAC can better support these institutions in this difficult times? For example, can NAC provide additional support or convert existing grant by getting these institutions to invest in capability development, so that they can emerge stronger from the crisis?Expanding Partnerships for Singapore TogetherMs Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): Sir, I declare my interest as founder of A Good Space, a community of citizen change makers and Hush, a social enterprise. In light of the $250 million top-up and the spirit of Singapore Together, would the Ministry consider the following.One, increasing the maximum funding in Our Singapore Fund and other funds to minimise the need to apply for multiple grants by ground-ups who are made up of citizen volunteers.Two, revising the framework in disbursing grants such that projects which are longer-term in nature or design, for example research, or projects which are seeking to be more sustainable, can receive longer term funding required in line with the time required for community development.And three, removing the cap on the amount or percentage of budget that can be spent on paying project owners, since they are often the ones putting in the most time and effort into the project, and for manpower needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis?Community Engagement on LGBTQ+IssuesAssoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, since 2009, the annual Pink Dot SG has attracted tens of thousands of Singaporeans to attend in support of the LGBTQ+ community. However, many Singaporeans have also expressed concerns about Pink Dot SG and some have organised counter-events such as Wear White.A 2019 IPS study found that there have been \"steep drops\" in opposition towards LGBTQ+ issues. Unfortunately, divisions along this fault line may nonetheless deepen, given the role other social divides, such as religion and age, play in shaping attitudes towards LGBTQ+ issues. If these divisions were left unchecked, it increases the potential for acts of violence and discrimination to be committed against vulnerable groups, including hate speech and online harassment.The Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles or IRCCs have served an important role in strengthening social cohesion through dialogues, workshops and other programmes, amongst various religious and racial groups. In light of the friction concerning LGBTQ+ issues, one way to foster social harmony would be to include vulnerable and marginalised groups, such as the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities and migrant workers and other groups, to be a mainstay in initiatives similar to IRCCs.The purpose of such initiatives is not to convert anyone to any particular viewpoint on these issues, but to mitigate polarisation by strengthening social cohesion and fostering understanding and respect across differences.Given the contributions of IRCCs in promoting social harmony, could the Ministry convene similar community engagement initiatives that aim to bridge gaps between religious groups, the LGBTQ+ community and other stakeholders, with the aim of fostering mutual understanding?The Chairman: Ms Yip Pin Xiu, you can take the three cuts together.Disability Sports MasterplanMs Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, I declare my interest as a current athlete. The Disability Sports Master Plan, otherwise known as the DSMP, started its implementation in 2016. It was formed after the Vision 2030 exercise to redefine the role of sport in Singapore. One of the four Strategic Themes in Vision 2030 is ‘Sport without Boundaries’ where sports should be inclusive, with opportunities for people of all abilities to participate. DSMP was born to address gaps in the existing ecosystem to provide support for disability sports.For the past three years, DSMP has been able to react and address some of these gaps. I am highly appreciative of the planning and investment. Perhaps it is timely that we now do a stocktake, and review what had worked, and what are new opportunities that may not have been available when DSMP was first implemented.After research done in 2015, the DSMP had identified the barriers to participation and had three broad recommendations then; which was to expand access and opportunities for sports participation by PWDs, develop organisational and professional capabilities in disability sports, and build public awareness of disability sports and strengthen affinity with Team Singapore athletes.So far, the DSMP team has come up with three disability sports programs which is the Play-Ability, Yes! I Can and Intro a Sport, There are plans to make sports complex more accessible. Currently there are seven inclusive gyms and pool wheelchairs have been put in place at five Active SG pools where there are ramps into the pools. Para Sports Coaching courses have been organised and there has been outreach and engagements, opportunities for volunteers. I would like to know if measurable outcomes were set in relation to the intended broad outcomes of the DSMP.From an initiative started out to fill gaps, we should now look at the whole landscape and think of how to build bridges of opportunities with other sectors that work closely with PWDs, to maximise the potentials of the DSMP, with strategic execution. I firmly believe that this plan has the ability to determine the speed of success for Sports Without Boundaries in Singapore in the long run. Is a second version of the DSMP in the works, to review the landscape, and build bridges of opportunities, and support more aspects of disability sports? While programmes and infrastructure are improving, we should also leverage existing investments to promote access and build affinity for inclusion.Firstly, while PE teachers have undergone training in inclusive PE, have we evaluated whether they are now confident in carrying out inclusive PE? How many students with disabilities are still not participating in PE? My peers and I have gone through the exact same experience during our school days. I have been told to sit out and look after school bags while the rest of my classmates were in PE class. We were looked at differently, as if PE was something that did not matter to us, yet somehow essential for able-body students to gain different benefits, like teamwork and social networking.Secondly, if we look at engagements in schools, CCAs form another channel where we can layer on our investments to promote inclusion through sport. Schools can be supported to convert existing CCAs to welcome suitable students with disabilities, while specialised CCAs on para sports can provide a setting for students with and without disabilities to increase interaction and develop inclusive partnerships. If the children of today are exposed to this I believe that there is a higher chance they will grow up thinking that being inclusive is normal. The students will learn that it is possible to adapt, to include the people around them. and people with disabilities are not that different from them. The landscape will change not only for our youth with disabilities but will also lay a strong foundation in our young for a caring and inclusive society.As a model, the DSMP should also encourage inclusive partnerships at a higher order, such as having Special Education Schools included in the School Sports Council.Third, in a study highlighted by the DSMP, most VWOs, now called social service agencies, overlook the benefits that sports and physical activity can bring to PWDs and their overall well-being, due to the sources of their funding. An example is a recent Community Chest Charity Support Fund call, where it was informed that \"agencies that support programmes that contribute to the psycho-socio well-being of target clients\" would be eligible for funding, but such programmes would exclude \"sports\". It confused me that sports were not considered to contribute to psycho-socio well-being, where in fact an annex in the DSMP was dedicated to this. Are we able to review programmes and capability funding to social service agencies to promote sports, and reduce “oversight” of such benefits?Fourth, with transportation being highlighted as a critical factor preventing sports participation, can we explore expanding the current transport subsidy schemes and assistive technology schemes to support PWD in pursuing Quality of Life activities, such as sports? While most employers are benefiting from grant schemes to redesign jobs and work environments to employ PWDs, soft skills are equally important to PWDs for employability.Finally, the DSMP currently focuses mainly on outreach, and not on future development. However, if one of the aim is to build awareness and strengthen affinity with Team Singapore athletes, is there a possibility for DSMP to look at the entire spectrum of disability sports, from outreach to development to performance, and work with the current existing stakeholders in the respective areas to maximise efficiency of the resources?In the lastCOSI raised the topic on Integrating National Sports Systems. To date, while there have been national sport systems that have voiced their interest in inclusion, concrete steps are still missing to support this progression in a systemic manner. We can have a challenge fund under Sport Singapore to encourage NSAs towards integration.The Disability Sports Master Plan plays a big role in increasing participation and making Singapore a more accessible, inclusive and caring community. I am very eager to be a part of this ecosystem while we move towards our vision of Sports without Boundaries. The next phase of the DSMP can help to build bridges with various ministries and partner social service agencies to enable Singaporeans where they can have a better quality of life and lead an active and healthy life through sports.Mental Health Support for AthletesSir, I will now take my second cut on Mental Health Support for Athletes. As an athlete, I have seen many of my peers face pressures from their sport, academics, work, and different aspects from their life. These pressures can sometimes affect their mental well-being.Athletes retiring and transitioning out of sports can also find it difficult mentally and emotionally as most athletes have been doing this sport their whole life and it is their identity.Currently, the support for sports psychology is excellent. However, the support is for athletes to perform at a highest level and they may not be trained to help athletes with their mental well-being or any mental health issues. The programme, Mind Matters, was created in 2017 to develop the mental health framework but the reach in this programme has been very limited with only five full sessions being conducted to 55 participants.Would the Ministry consider providing mental health support as a strategic priority, and clarify what measures are in place for current and retiring athletes in this regard?11.45 amOne Team Singapore FundSir, onto my third cut for our One Team Singapore Fund. The One Team Singapore Fund serves as a multiplier to help sporting organisations level up their high performance. Most National Sports Associations (NSAs) are small outfits and work very hard to source for funding. One way is to market the NSA or its athletes to secure sponsorships, where it then becomes a win-win situation for both the NSA and the sponsor.While such sponsorships may be geared towards high performance, the One Team Singapore funding mechanism only allows donations to be matched and not sponsorships. This regulation appears to penalise the NSA for their efforts, rather than the sponsor. If the concern is sponsors receiving \"double\" benefit through \"doubled\" recognition for the matched funds, can this be mitigated by imposing a condition on the matched funds, rather than rejecting such matching altogether? If this Fund can apply to sponsorships as well, it can encourage corporates to play a bigger part in supporting local sports.FIFA World Cup 2034Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap: Sir, in August 2019, it was reported in the media that Vice President of Football Association of Singapore (FAS), Mr Edwin Tong mentioned that, I quote, \"FIFA World Cup 2034 will be a realistic goal for Singapore.\"Following this good news, I had failed a Parliamentary Question in September 2019 on the matter. I asked MCCY what are the Football Association of Singapore (FAS)'s plans in working towards achieving this goal for Singapore's Football National Team to qualify for FIFA World Cup in 2034.Sir, the Ministry replied as follows, I quote, \"The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth welcomes our Team Singapore athletes and sports association to strive for excellence and support them in realising their goal. We look forward to hearing from the FAS on their plan to achieving their stated goal and how the football fraternity, community and the Government can support them in their efforts.\"Sir, I have been looking forward and waited since September 2019 for updates from the Football Association of Singapore or MCCY. This time around I do hope to hear some positive sharing from the Minister on the matter.Sporting SingaporeEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon): Sir, in the midst of COVID-19 affecting Singapore and the rest of the world, the subjects of \"national resilience\", \"community bonding\" and \"national pride\" in how Singapore manages the epidemic is popping up. Coincidentally, true sporting nations typically display such positive attributes. In fact, I recall that the Committee of Sporting Singapore report in 2001, championed by Mr Goh Chok Tong, articulated these three desired outcomes of a Sporting Singapore, the other two being \"vibrant society and economy\" and \"international friendship\".Minister Grace Fu was quoted by Straits Times on 16 January 2020 that: \"There’s so much more that we can do before we can really call ourselves a sporting country”.But we have made progress, and I cite the example raised by Senior Minister of State Sim Ann in Parliament on 5 November 2019 that more people with disabilities (PWD) are participating in sport, with the Government exploring how a related master plan can make more progress.Rewinding back the clock: in 2010, Singapore was awarded: the Gold for Sports City Award at the 2010 International Sports Events Management Awards, and Runners-up for the 2010 Ultimate Sports City at the Sports Accord Convention. The international sporting community took notice of this little red dot’s sporting achievements during the 2001 to 2010 period.GDP contribution from the sports industry grew from $300 million in 2000 to $1 billion in 2008, including the hosting of the 2005 International Olympic Committee Session, 2008 inaugural F1 Singapore Grand Prix, 2009 inaugural Asian Youth Games, and 2010 inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG).The job creation objective was catalysed by the startup of Singapore Sports School in 2004, the launch of UK Loughborough University’s sports science degree in partnership with NTU, the emphasis of sports health leisure by Republic Polytechnic, ITE, and other private institutions.Working under MOU partnerships, the EDB, the previous Media Development Authority and Singapore Sports Council successfully courted international companies to relocate to Singapore and thereby created new jobs, for example, ASICS, Decathlon.In 2008, the former MCYS Minister, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, announced a target for the Singapore sports industry: $2 billion annual contribution to Singapore’s GDP and the creation of 20,000 jobs by 2015. Sir, the sporting fraternity seeks an update on the GDP contribution and jobs created.Next, Singapore Sports Hub. For this national iconic project, much has been said about the Public Private Partnership model; however, the sporting fraternity has yet to see positive changes that will convince Singaporeans that we have the right private sector partner running this national project.Instead, we have witnessed a continuous exodus of staff last year and this year, including the majority C-suite of SportsHub: CEO, CFO, COO, Chief Commercial Officer, and General Counsel. From public reports, there has also been critical changes to the shareholders and key partners: for example, the 83% majority shareholder Infra Red Capital Partners has been acquired by Sun Life. Is this a material change? Will it further impact negatively the desired outcomes of the project.Sir, it would be timely for Minister to provide us with an update on the situation at Singapore Sports Hub, given that we are approaching the end of six years of full operations.Please also update how we will keep our sporting calendar vibrant, given the non-performance of the contractual promise by SportsHub Private Limited to host 90 sporting event days per year at National Stadium. Are we getting value for money for this national project.On this subject, I would like to appeal to MCCY once again. Tampines has Our Tampines Hub; Bedok has Heartbeat @ Bedok; Sembawang has Sembawang Integrated Hub.What does Yishun have? A rundown swimming complex opened in 1988 and an old sports stadium opened in 1992. The remaking of our sports facilities is to remain relevant and affordable, and to meet demands of the community. I am sure that the population of Yishun town has grown, and Yishunites deserve more and better sporting facilities.The Chairman: Mr Terence Ho, you can take your two cuts together.Championing Arts GivingMr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member): Chairman, arts giving. Amid the evolving of the COVID-19 outbreak, the arts community brings people together, spreads love and positivity. In my previous speeches, I mentioned that I believe that a more targeted and well-defined Culture Matching Fund (CMF) policy can help small, medium arts groups in Singapore enjoy the benefits.To battle the economy downturn, I propose to review and reconsider the CMF.One, can the Government consider launching a Relief and Recovery Measures to Arts Group by providing 1:2 matching grant instead of 1:1? This is a period for all arts groups; with the sudden cancellations and postponement of shows, arts groups are predicted to experience a deficit within the period.Two, will the Government also consider providing more for the project and production grant, such as the Tote Board Arts Fund so as to allow the arts groups to work on recovery plans to bring back audiences and call back artistes for future performances? More help is definitely needed to bring back audiences and assure them that the shows will go on. The COVID-19 outbreak has an impact on the worldwide economy and it takes time for the outbreak to settle down. I believe that there is a need to path a recovery route for all arts groups and is vital and to make the arts vibrant and accessible to the public again.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]During this trying period, operations of arts groups have been seriously affected. The sustainability of arts and cultural groups require strong Government support, and also sponsorship and donations from corporates, foundations and individuals who recognise the importance of arts and culture.In my previous speeches, I suggested that the Government exercises greater flexibility and adopt a more targeted approach in the administration of the Cultural Matching Fund (CMF).For example, aside from providing matching grants according to the amount of funds raised, the Government could perhaps consider providing matching grants according to performances and ticket sales.To help arts groups tide over this difficult period, I hope the Government can review the disbursement of CMF by:First, the Government can consider launching a relief package to help arts groups overcome the current difficulties by increasing the ratio of CMF from 1:1 to 1:2. This will help to increase funding for cultural and arts groups, who can then use the funds to tide over this period.Second, the Government can consider increasing project and production grants for arts groups, so that they can come up with exciting programmes to attract audiences. Bringing back audiences to performances cannot be done overnight. However, I believe that if arts groups unite together and go all-out to attract audiences, the crowd will come back, and the entire arts scene will be rejuvenated.How to canvas for donations and sponsorships beyond Government funding is the greatest challenge faced by most arts groups. We hope to nurture more fans of the arts, including those who appreciate the arts and those who are willing to sponsor arts activities.This is the hope of many arts groups. I also hope that arts groups can attract new audiences, who will eventually become advocates for the arts, and that all arts performances will enjoy such good ticket sales that only standing room will be left.Space Synergy for the Arts(In English): My second cut. Arts groups now and in the future will require a significant amount of space to express their creativity and store their props and sets. The arts space will help artistes and arts groups to grow and we need to keep up the growth of the arts group. With limited land space in Singapore, it is increasingly difficult to increase the gross floor area (GFA) of the arts community. Do we have a short, mid and long-term plan to cater to the growing needs and create space synergy for the arts?Earlier on in September 2019, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng announced that arts freelancers will have an arts resource website, and will also have dedicated working spaces. In my previous speeches, I proposed that the Government can consider a central shared warehouse for the arts community, where props and sets can be stored, shared or reused. This is one of the ways we can do our part to save the Earth from climate change, reducing wastage and disposal issues.In addition to that, perhaps the Government can consider including shopping malls and even unused national monument space, to cater for arts use. For instance, Wild Rice is housed within Funan and Singapore Dance Theatre is housed within Bugis+. We can integrate arts and culture within malls, to further increase the audiences’ reach.Furthermore, as the world continues to face challenges during this outbreak, the local arts community is doing their part to rally Singaporeans. For example, the Theatre arts groups came together, to promote and share about each other’s’ upcoming productions. These are heartwarming gestures.To battle the virus together, I propose the following.One, can the National Arts Council help provide rental rebates, for arts group housed at Goodman Arts Centre and Stamford Arts Centre, to name a few. This will help to tide the arts groups through this difficult period of low attendance and cancellation of their shows.Two, can there be introduction of shared services among the arts groups, in terms of Professional Services such as legal advice, audit and accounting services? This can help reduce the expenditure of the arts groups.12.00 pmThe synergy of arts space can integrate, interest and ignite the collaboration among arts groups and utilise resources to the fullest. The arts bring diverse communities together. Amidst the challenging periods again, I am certain that the local arts community will continue to do their part to rally Singaporeans.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.] As arts groups grow, they will need more space for practice, rehearsals, and storing props and stage sets. With limited land space in Singapore, there are not many places that can be used for arts groups. I hope we could do the following:First, Government Ministries can engage in inter-Ministerial discussions on how to increase space allocated for culture and arts.Second, during the current COVID-19 outbreak, I hope that we can consider granting rental rebates to arts groups, so that they can focus on rehearsals as usual, and not lose the drive to perform due to loss of income because of cancellation of performances. My wish is that the dance will continue, the music will not stop playing, and we can live life as per normal.Quality Arts Productions for UnderservedMs Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar): Sir, culture and the arts help build a sense of community, bringing people together by providing a common experience and shared worldview. They also provide opportunities for learning, communication and entertainment. Therefore, it is important to ensure that culture and the arts are accessible to individuals from all walks of life. Every segment of our society, including the less privileged, should have access to a wide range of quality arts performances.I would like to commend MCCY for doing much to bring the arts to the less privileged. One example is the WeCare Arts Fund, a year-round funding scheme that supports artists and Social Service Agencies in developing participatory workshops for beneficiaries.In Singapore, free, non-ticketed arts events are widespread and easily accessible. In fact, non-ticketed arts attendance has been climbing over the years, reaching an all-time high in 2018.Last December, the Singapore Chinese Orchestra gave a free performance in an open area at my market/hawker centre. My residents, especially the seniors, were delighted to have a wonderful concert at their doorstep. They spent a memorable evening singing along with the evergreen hits and nostalgic tunes. It was a most heartwarming sight and I really want to thank our hon Nominated Member Mr Terence Ho and Singapore Chinese Orchestra (SCO) for making this happen. Our seniors are really looking forward to the next one, which is coming up soon.Quality arts performances can be expensive to produce and affordability would be an obstacle for the less privileged. They may require interlocutors to provide context to the performances and may need to attend such events with friends and family to feel comfortable and to enjoy the performance. How would MCCY address these issues?Access to ArtsMr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang): Chairman, I would like to echo Ms Joan Pereira's call for arts to be accessible to all, regardless of socio-economic status. Besides looking at the issue from the perspective of consumers of arts and culture, is MCCY also looking at the issue from the perspective of the providers of arts and culture? Do our artists have the physical space as well as the platform to practice as well as showcase their craft. This is important to ensure that we have a diverse and vibrant arts scene.Back in 2017, I asked the same question duringCOSand the Ministry indicated that it has opened up Gillman Barracks for artists to showcase their craft. However, anecdotally, the awareness of Gillman Barracks is not high and the tenants there are not doing well as a result. Are there plans to rejuvenate Gillman Barracks and also open up other locations for our local artists?Bringing Arts and Culture to CommunityMr Lee Yi Shyan (East Coast): Sir, as a First World economy, we strive to be a First World people – charitable and gracious, considerate and compassionate. Apart from pursuing economic goals, we should also have room for the intangibles of life: to understand our history, appreciate our heritage, celebrate our diversity and participate in artistic expressions of various forms.Thanks to years of consistent investments, we can be proud of having world-class venues in performing theatre, museum and art gallery. Singaporeans have ready access to world-class concerts, performances and exhibitions. We have a vibrant arts scene.Arts and culture, however, should not be confined to the premises of museums and concert halls. Instead, they should flourish in the daily lives of our people. Visitors to Italian cities such as Florence would see amazing sculptures and magnificent architecture at piazzas, along streets and on their buildings.In my constituency, we work hard to bring arts and culture into the community. Since its opening two years ago, Heartbeat has held more than 250 workshops on arts and crafts, painting, sculpturing, calligraphy. Our choir, orchestra and interests groups put up pubic performances. We are grateful to PA, NHB and NAC for their support and partnership.Sir, may I ask for your permission to display a picture on the LCD screens.The Chairman: Yes, please. [A slide was shown to hon Members.]Mr Lee Yi Shyan: When Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong opened the Heartbeat@Bedok on 4 February 2018, we unveiled a locally-installed art work named “Pulses”. Singapore is no Florence but we could still envision our version of renaissance.Given this context, would the Minister enlighten us how MCCY views arts and culture development in the community? Would MCCY support more ground-up initiatives on visual arts including installation of art works at public places, with programme akin to URA's \"The Art Incentive Scheme\"?The Chairman: Minister Grace Fu.The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien): Twenty-twenty marks the beginning of a new decade. For MCCY, we ended the last decade on a strong note across our domains, where Singaporeans came together to celebrate our heritage, our unity and our sporting achievements.We commemorated our Bicentennial, recalling our history and how together we built a nation. Our religious leaders came together to affirm their Commitment to Safeguard Religious Harmony at the inaugural International Conference on Cohesive Societies. Our country rallied behind Team Singapore athletes at the SEA Games, who brought home 53 gold medals, 46 silver medals and 68 bronze medals.We have become a more caring nation through voluntary acts of spontaneous and everyday kindness. There have been many accounts of how Singaporeans have looked out for each other in recent weeks during the COVID-19 outbreak. Many of us desire to do more for the community, from donating to volunteering.As a people, we have become more confident about our identity, what we can offer and showcase to the world. With strong public support, we submitted our nomination to inscribe Hawker Culture in Singapore on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. We look forward to the outcome in December 2020.Making Singapore our home together is the heart of MCCY's work. We believe in collectively shaping the society we want to be – a caring people, a cohesive society and a confident nation. We work closely with partners to support the Singapore Cares movement. We encourage our citizens to step forward to serve, through Team Nila and Youth Corps Singapore. We have expanded opportunities for Singaporeans to engage in honest dialogue and understand each other better, through programmes such as BRIDGE. We partnered stakeholders to support the expression of national pride through Our SG Arts Plan and Our SG Heritage Plan. We empower our citizens through Our Singapore Fund, Our Harmony Fund and the National Youth Fund, to start ground-up projects that can inspire others and strengthen our identity as one people.With the Singapore Together movement, MCCY will do more to partner Singaporeans. In a world where people are increasingly tribal, divided and disconnected from each other, we will ensure Singapore’s social fabric remains strong, by working together to offer opportunities, community and inclusion to every member of society. We will enhance access to opportunities, foster a more caring and gracious community, and build an inclusive city of possibilities.For a society to be united, it must work for everyone, not just a few. There must be equal conditions for all to thrive. I am glad Dr Lim Wee Kiak raised this. We will enhance access to opportunities in the sports, arts and youth sectors for all Singaporeans at each stage of their lives.Mr Darryl David asked how MCCY will provide such opportunities for all children and youths. In the early pre-school years, a child's main way of learning and developing is through play.Under our Children and Youth Sport Framework, we will provide more in- and out-of-school play opportunities for our children to support their physical and intellectual growth. In 2017, SportSG initiated the Nurture Kids programme to complement ECDA's development framework for our young children. Last year, we partnered 125 pre-schools and introduced fundamental movement skills such as jumping, throwing and balancing in a safe and fun way to more than 5,000 children. This year, we will double efforts, and make this available to 250 pre-schools. We will also partner MOE to ensure all pre-school teachers graduating from the National Institute of Early Childhood have the skills to help our children develop their fundamental motor skills.Complementing these initiatives, an \"Active Parents\" movement will be launched this year, to encourage and equip parents to play an active role in our children’s sporting journey.At our Primary and Secondary schools, we will continue partnering MOE to provide our students with opportunities for a well-rounded education through sports and culture. In 2020, we will expand the School Sports Partnership and introduce \"Active Play\". Primary schools can tie up with SportSG to conduct different sports, so students can pick up these sports conveniently – during recess, school sports days or at nearby sports centres. These non-competitive arenas can encourage students to try more sports and bring them enjoyment while fostering confidence, teamwork and cohesion.We are also exploring more offerings under the Strategic Partnership CCA pilot formed last year between MOE, the National Arts Council (NAC) and SportSG. This allows students to pursue their interests, even if these are not offered as CCAs in their schools. They will be able to represent their schools in national competitions and platforms. Athletics and Ethnic Dance are currently offered under this programme. This year, where there is demand, SportSG is ready to open up more locations to support Athletics training. On its part, NAC will work with LASALLE College of the Arts to provide Ethnic Dance experiences for interested students.We will nurture creativity and expand horizons of our children by celebrating our history and igniting their love for our heritage. The Singapore Philatelic Museum will be revamped as a dedicated children’s museum where children can learn about a wide range of themes, including the heritage and culture of Singapore and the region, by playing with interactive and immersive exhibits. For instance, there will be a permanent exhibition on \"Singapore, Our Home\", where children can learn how early pioneers lived and worked, and role-play as hawkers, coolies and merchants. The museum will re-open in 2021 and add to the current offerings for children, such as the Children’s Biennale at National Gallery Singapore.Our museums will also provide our students with shared experiences of learning together and appreciating Singapore's history. In 2020, the National Heritage Board will introduce Museum-based Learning (MBL) as part of MOE's Learning Journeys for students.All Primary 6 and Secondary 2 cohorts will visit the Asian Civilisations Museum and National Museum of Singapore respectively. Students will travel through the museums in small groups, interact with museum educators and complete hands-on activities with their friends.12.15 pmFor instance, at the National Museum, students can learn the struggles of the Japanese occupation by choosing artefacts they are interested in and having conversations around those artefacts. One such artefact is Elizabeth Choy's dress, which she wore while held captive.Through this experience of exploring our history as a cohort, we hope our students will form shared memories together, and learn important values such as self-determination and helping one another during difficult times. These initiatives will make learning more meaningful and come alive for students, as they go through their Character and Citizenship Education syllabus and subjects such as Social Studies in Primary school and History in Secondary school.In an age where Asia's economy is growing in significance, our youths need to understand regional markets to thrive in the future economy. Our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) already provide youths with opportunities to build their economic, social and cultural awareness of the region. Youth Corps Singapore piloted the enhanced Youth Expedition Projects (YEP+) in 2018 to provide youths with deeper understanding of the region. The YEP+ comprises not only of community service, but also visits to multinational corporations and start-ups.Our participants have made their marks in Indonesia, Laos, Vietnam and China. Currently, the YEP+ provides about 5,000 opportunities for regional exposure.In 2020, we will increase opportunities for youths to engage the region. The National Youth Council (NYC) will partner IHLs to expand short-term immersion opportunities to ASEAN, China and India for ITE, Polytechnic and University students, through the new Asia-Ready Exposure Programme (AEP). The AEP will curate industry-focused experiences in the region for our youths to be more aware of the economic opportunities in these countries.By 2022, NYC's regional exposure programmes, including the AEP, will support up to 10,000 youths each year. This is double the current number of youths benefiting from NYC's programmes. This will contribute to the \"70-and-70\" target for students, announced by the Finance Minister in his Budget Speech and enhance the Asia-readiness of our future workforce.Not forgetting those who are less youthful, we will ensure everyone has opportunities to lead full and active lives. By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be at or above the age of 65, and we will have 900,000 seniors. Sports and physical activity allow our seniors to sustain their health and mobility longer and continue to be engaged in the community.From this year, we will make public gyms and swimming pools free for all Singaporeans aged 65 years and above. We will review the age criterion from time to time, in keeping with the trends and life expectancy of Singaporeans. SportSG will also partner the Agency for Integrated Care to bring programmes for seniors to their doorsteps, at Senior Citizens' Corners and Senior Activity Centres.I have touched on new initiatives for Singaporeans at each stage of life. Equally important, we must ensure that access to the things that make a full life – the beauty of the arts, the rigour of sports, the knowledge of our heritage, the support of our community – is open to all, regardless of background.We will continue to increase access to sports facilities around the island, under our Sports Facilities Master Plan. This year, we will break ground for the new Punggol Regional Sport Centre. We will bring new Sport-in-Precinct facilities to Sengkang South, Pasir Ris East and Dover, achieving our target of initiating 20 Sport-in-Precinct projects by 2020. We will rejuvenate another five ActiveSG facilities, from swimming complexes in Ang Mo Kio, to, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah may like to know, sport centres in Yishun.In partnership with MOE, over 90% of suitable Government Primary and Secondary schools' sports halls and fields have been converted for public use under the Dual Use Scheme. We will work with MOE to convert all remaining suitable facilities by this time next year. These initiatives will help realise our aspiration of having sports and recreational facilities within a 10-minute walk from our homes.Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked about broadening access to the arts. Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Terence Ho made similar suggestions in this House. We will ensure that all Singaporeans have access to quality arts productions. This year, we will enhance the WeCare Arts Fund by launching the WeCare Arts Experiences, in partnership with the five Community Development Councils (CDCs). This will enable less privileged families to attend ticketed presentations for free at our cultural institutions such as the Esplanade, SSO and NHB museums, through a subsidy of up to $40 for a ticket.By 2022, the National Arts Council and CDCs aim to reach up to 20,000 beneficiaries and volunteers under the scheme. As Mr Terence Ho noted, everyone has a part to play in enhancing access to the arts and we encourage volunteers to step up and work with Social Service Agencies to see how they too can contribute their time. Mr Chairman, I would like to speak in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]We will enhance access to opportunities for all. For our preschool children, we will help train the teachers to stimulate their physical and intellectual growth through. For our school-going children, we will provide a more holistic learning journey, by expanding avenues for them to try new sports. We will also provide more opportunities in building shared experiences through learning our national history together. For post-secondary youths, we will increase opportunities for them to gain cultural literacy and a deeper understanding of the region.We will ensure our seniors can lead full and active lives. We will ensure that everyone has convenient access to sports facilities. We will also ensure that our lower income families will be able to enjoy quality arts productions, so we can all flourish as a society together.However, such opportunities alone do not make a good home. We must enable and help one another to succeed. Every Singaporean counts, we will only by progressing together. As a people, we need to recognise and act on our mutual obligations to our fellow citizens.(In English):Beyond providing opportunities for all, we wish to build a strong community spirit where we care and help one another. There is more each of us can do to give and to lift the less fortunate and more vulnerable among us. Senior Minister of State will provide more details on these initiatives.We will deepen our commitment to one another as one people and to Singapore. In 2020, MCCY will partner Singapore citizens to create content on what makes us Singaporean and this content will be used to update our Singapore Citizenship Journey. Through this process, Singaporeans will articulate and affirm who we are as a people, while co-creating content to enrich new citizens' understanding of Singapore.After an open call in January, we will convene a Citizens Workgroup comprising of interested persons from diverse fields and organisations. Over the next few months, they will discuss what unites us as Singaporeans and research topics close to our hearts. This would include our values and obligations as Singaporeans, social norms and our culture and national history. Their recommendations will be published by end-2020.When we affirm our common fate, support one another and work and progress together side by side, we live a democracy of deeds. A clear manifestation of this has been the crafting of the SG Youth Action Plan, where more than 70,000 youths proactively shared their ideas and views on Singapore in 2025. Senior Minister of State will share more on this.Ms Anthea Ong and Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked how we will support ground up efforts better. Finance Minister has shared in his Budget Speech that the Government is prepared to invest up to $175 million from now to 2025 to engage active citizenry and develop partnerships.To support more projects, we will put $20 million of these funds into Our Singapore Fund and extend it to SG60 in 2025. Government will co-invest the balance in partners across all domains to support projects that address shared priorities. This enhanced support will help partners develop capacity and capabilities to sustain impactful initiatives. More immediately, Senior Parliamentary Secretary will also speak on our measures to support the arts and sports communities in view of the ongoing COVID-19 situation.To grow an inclusive society that embraces diversity, we will expand pathways to success that celebrate our diverse talents, skills and cultures. This year, we will provide more support to our athletes and artists, so they can excel and succeed and make Singapore a place of opportunities. We will support promising athletes representing Singapore who are not covered by our High Performance Sports system. We will work with individuals and groups to preserve our heritage in innovative ways and keep it alive so we can transmit it to future generations. Senior Parliamentary Secretary will share more details.Even as we celebrate what makes us different, we need to emphasise and protect what we share in common. A major reason for Singapore's success is that we stay open to the world while remaining cohesive as a nation. We combine unity with diversity, harmony with difference. We can do this because our communities hold our differences not in opposition to each other, but in a relationship of mutual respect. Diversity ensures we have the range and breadth of ideas, perspectives and resources to thrive globally. Because we come from different lands and cultures, the possibilities of what we can make together are so much richer. We see a common good and are committed to building something better. We rely on one another for security, stability and prosperity.Assoc Prof Walter Theseira asked how we will foster mutual understanding on LGBTQ. In many of our discussions with citizens, the issue of sexual orientation has often been raised. It is grounded on personal values and beliefs and consensus is not always possible. However, we agree with Assoc Prof Walter Theseira, that we do not shy away from discussing it and it is important that we have platforms where we can engage on our differences on the basis of mutual respect.For instance, at the Youth Conversations and SG Youth Action Plan engagements, youths had a safe space to express views, on their aspirations, concerns, fears and disappointments. Participants voiced their opinions, including on LGBTQ issues, while others listened with civility and respect.Through such platforms, we listen to those different from us and seek to understand them on their terms, even with our disagreements; we expand the common space to engage one another and work together on the things that we want in common. When we drop the mindset of \"us versus them\" and see ourselves as a collective \"we\", Singaporeans with different points of view can sit together and work on issues important to our shared future, such as jobs and economy, the environment, the vulnerable and the disadvantaged.We will continue to support partners and agencies to build capacity and capabilities within the community for more inclusive civil discourse. We will support platforms that bring together people who hold different perspectives. And we will partner ground-up efforts to promote social harmony. In Mandarin, Sir.12.30 pm(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Apart from the recent COVID-19 situation, racism, religionism, and protectionism are also on the rise globally. People are increasingly tribal, divided and disconnected from each other. As such, we will ensure Singapore's social fabric stays strong, by working together to offer opportunities, community and inclusion to every member of society. Bearing in mind our vision, we will build a home that provides opportunities for all, by enhancing access to these opportunities and allowing people to develop their full potentials.We will also foster a more caring and gracious community, where we do not forget to help and enable one another to succeed. We will build an inclusive city that celebrates our diverse talents and cultures. Finally, with the Singapore Together Movement, MCCY will do more to partner Singaporeans to build a caring, cohesive and confident Singapore.(In English): To conclude, Sir, we in MCCY often ask ourselves if we are making progress towards our vision of a caring people, cohesive society and confident nation for Singapore. We are aware that the strength of our society is not measured by, say, the number of art events we hold, or the amount of grants made. The answer lies in our responses when we face a major crisis as a nation. COVID-19 is the moment that allows us to search for the answer. To get through the crisis, we must unite around our values of multi-racialism, openness and self-determination. We must not let fear and anxiety come between us. That it is a worldwide crisis gives us a good basis of comparison with others.Sir, I would put to this House that Singapore and Singaporeans have come up well as a caring people, cohesive society and a confident nation.Singapore has united as one, and acted and applied our minds to help one another. Many have stepped up to show what it means to be Singaporean. Those working at the frontline of our defence are standing tall and stoically in their positions despite shouldering risks to themselves and their families. Some, like the pilots and crew of Scoot and the MFA officers who flew into Wuhan to retrieve Singaporeans there, showed courage, sense of duty and self-sacrifice, and made the nation proud. Some contributed time and resources to those in need, going deep into the community to reach out to seniors and the vulnerable in their homes. As the situation developed, more of us have come forward to help, in whatever way we can to anyone, regardless of race, language or religion.This is a testament to the strength of our society and our progress as one people. And I think years of developing that support on the ground whether it is through PA, whether it is through Team Nila, our Youth Corp Singapore, have shown us we have the strength, a very strong and firm layer of volunteers that is out there that will support us, the Government, in reaching out to the ground and helping the ground. While other countries see their citizens standing in line in the cold for hours for two pieces of masks per person, we have distributed four masks per household within days, without queues. And I think this is the day we have been practising so hard, that we are preparing so hard for. And I think Singapore has really come well.And through our actions, we demonstrate that we are in this together, with trust and confidence in the Government and in one another. Together, we are working out solutions to new problems. We will emerge a stronger nation. This is the Singapore Spirit and the heart of our nation. [Applause.]The Senior Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Sim Ann): Mr Chairman, Singapore Together is our commitment to partner Singaporeans to build a \"democracy of deeds\", as Deputy Prime Minister Heng shared last year.The past weeks have shown how much we have grown as a democracy of deeds, with many rising to the occasion and having contributed to the common good amidst our ongoing fight against COVID-19.Last month, Team Singapore bowlers packed and distributed masks and hand sanitisers to seniors in Clementi. Others showed appreciation for our unsung heroes. Ms Lim Sio Yen and Mr Ernest Koh Jun Ming set up video booths at various malls inviting people to record messages of support for those working in sectors such as healthcare, transport and security. We are heartened by such initiatives, and want to inspire more. This is why we introduced SG United, a one-stop portal to volunteer, donate, start and share community-led initiatives in response to COVID-19.We believe that many who have made the first step of giving will continue to do so, inspiring others along the way. Over time, our society will grow as a community of open hearts and helping hands. This matters because no one – not the Government, the private sector, or people sector – has a monopoly on good ideas. We can only find the best solutions to build a better future we all share, through partnership.Let me start with our youths.In 2019, youths such as Greta Thunberg, made global headlines. In Hong Kong, Chile, Lebanon, Sudan, young people were at the forefront of civic protests and calls for change. Policy-makers and thinkers pondered how youths are different and what that means for the future.In Singapore and at MCCY, we began the process of engaging youths in 2018, with the Youth Conversations, a safe space for youths to talk about their aspirations and concerns. Like their elders, youths care deeply about their families and have the drive to succeed. There are also topics where they have a different outlook. If we do not listen to or work closely with our youths, these differences will lead to miscommunication, frustration, and divergence. Youths are also keen to move from conversation to action. These insights spurred us to refine our engagement approach to emphasise scale and more tangible impact. Our new approach has three key aspects.First, we supported youths in envisioning and actualising their ideas. Last May, we launched a national platform for youths to articulate and achieve their vision for Singapore in 2025: the SG Youth Action Plan. Mr Yam asked for a progress update on the SG Youth Action Plan, and what youths can look forward to this year. Since SG Youth Action Plan’s launch, we reached out to over 400,000 youths, and engaged close to 70,000 of them through digital engagement, public roadshows and focus group discussions. This is our most ambitious youth engagement exercise yet.A diverse panel of youth leaders compiled thousands of youth voices into a draft vision of what youths hope to see in our near future. And here is what it says:\"Before we change the world, we must first change ourselves. We may not always get it right, but with hard work, compassion and determination, we will foster an inclusive, sustainable and progressive Singapore. We will create a home where Singaporeans care for one another, and have a fair shot at their dreams. Twenty-twenty five, we are coming for you!\"The draft youth vision conveys youth priorities, and provides us with a positive sense of what Singapore’s future will look like when the youths of today become the movers and shakers of tomorrow. We invite youths to help us refine this vision further.We have already begun empowering youths with information, resources, and networks to turn their ideas into reality. This is the purpose of the Youth Action Challenge or YAC. The inaugural YAC saw 250 youth participants in 57 teams consult industry experts and policymakers to prototype ideas on the themes of environment, society and jobs. I witnessed some of these teams’ pitches in January, and was impressed by their passion. Allow me to share two examples:Team Movement of Inclusivity is keen to help frontline staff in public spaces better assist persons with hidden disabilities. Another team, Team ASEAN Business Youth Association, wants our youths to become more ASEAN-savvy. So, they built a prototype platform offering regional networking opportunities for youths.While the top teams will present their proposals at the YAC Summit next month for up to $50,000 of funding, NYC will help all 57 teams to implement their ideas. There will also be further editions of the YAC for youths to drive change on new themes that they care about.The SG Youth Action Plan will also focus on championing youth concerns. The Panel partnered the Youth Alliance on Mental Health to call for more whole-of-society action in reducing stigma, strengthening peer support, and tackling workplace discrimination. Following such feedback, TAFEP has taken steps to advise employers against asking job applicants about their mental health history when there is no relevance. The recently announced Youth Mental Well-being Network will build on the work of the SG Youth Action Plan to co-create solutions with our youths and different segments of society.I am excited by the progress made and I look forward to more areas in which our youths will make a difference.The second aspect of our new approach is to create more opportunities for youths to re-shape Singapore’s spaces. Youths have helped to co-create the Somerset Belt Masterplan, which Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey will share more about later this month, including how youths can enliven the Belt through their own initiatives.Youths can also look forward to co-creating and co-owning the youth hub within Kallang Alive!, a sporting and lifestyle destination from our sports blueprint, Vision 2030. Our youths are energetic, and have an edgier take on sports and the arts. The youth hub will be a space for such dynamism. Details of engagements with youths will be shared later this year.The third way we are approaching youth engagement differently is through NYC. NYC will be a conduit for youth voices by expanding its digital engagement channels so more diverse segments of youths can provide candid feedback. It will also build its capabilities to support public agencies in identifying emerging youth needs. We are also experimenting with ways for youth leaders to directly engage agencies on specific policy issues where they have relevant expertise.NYC will also be an incubator of youth action. Youths will receive greater support, through NYC’s curated leadership development and business exposure opportunities. Mr Chairman, in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]The year 2019 was shaken by the youth. Youth made global headlines, as they were at the forefront of protests and calls for change in cities around the world. Is this an indication that the next generation is better than the previous one, or, are they causing trouble for the world?This led many policy makers and thinkers to ponder how youths are different from their elders and what that means for the future. Here in Singapore, we began that process in 2018 with the Youth Conversations, where we provide youth a safe space to share with us their aspirations and diverse viewpoints. The Youth Conversations showed us that there are areas where youths bring to the table a different outlook. We should work together with them to cultivate this as a strength and move from conversation to action.That is why we embarked on a new approach of engaging our youths for greater scale and a tangible impact. In May 2019, we launched \"SG Youth Action Plan\" for youth to articulate their vision for Singapore in 2025 and to take action to achieve that vision.We reached out to over 400,000 youths and engaged 70,000 more closely, compiling thousands of youth voices into a clear statement on what young people hope to see in Singapore in the near future: a society that embodies the values of inclusiveness, fairness, care, sustainability and progress.To support youth to realise the vision, we started the Youth Action Challenge which empowers them with the information, resources and networks to co-create projects on issues they care about. The youth teams have come up with 57 exciting proposals on the themes of environment, societal issues, and jobs and future of work, and I look forward to seeing the top 12 teams pitch their proposals at the YAC Summit in April.We will continue to expand opportunities for youth to take actions and be heard in sustained manner, so that they can play an active part in building our home.12.45 pm(In English): Back to English, Mr Chairman. Volunteerism is an important means of realising our youths' vision of a caring and inclusive society. Everyone has a part to play, not just youths, but seniors, corporates and Government. Let me update on our efforts under each sector.I will start with youth volunteerism.Last year, YCS launched Programme X – X standing for multiplier – to equip youths to start impactful community projects and lead their peers in turn. Over 400 youths from ITEs, Polytechnics and Universities have taken part in Programme X.Sky Tai, a student from ITE College West, was one of them. Following the programme, he designed and ran eight weekly arts sessions for seniors at SASCO Home in Hong San together with his teammates. Programme X enabled him to hone his leadership capabilities and deepened his resolve to serve the community. YCS is also working with our SG Cares Volunteer Centres to promote youth volunteerism and grow youth volunteer networks in the neighbourhoods.Seniors also wish to remain socially active and engaged in their retirement years. To reach out to more pre-retirees at their workplaces, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with RSVP Singapore last year. With the MOU, RSVP aims to reach out to 30,000 seniors in its first year and match them to suitable volunteering opportunities.A new Team Nila Silver Champions Scheme will also provide seniors with regular volunteering opportunities at Active SG Sports Centres. This includes training alongside Team Nila youths to serve as ActiveSG ambassadors to promote sport and exercise together. Seniors will also receive training through SportSG and WSQ courses.On the corporate volunteerism front, NVPC and ComChest formed a closer partnership last year to help corporates access resources more easily and find better matches to volunteering opportunities. Over 30 corporates have been referred to our SG Cares Volunteer Centres to link up with community organisations for volunteering opportunities.Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Henry Kwek asked for an update on our SG Cares Volunteer Centres. Last year, four were established in Kreta Ayer, Toa Payoh, Boon Lay and Woodlands. This year, eight others will be appointed at Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Choa Chu Kang, Clementi, Geylang, Jalan Besar, Tampines and Yishun. Our aim is to establish an SG Cares Volunteer Centre in each town.As \"community brokers\", our SG Cares Volunteer Centres form partnerships with organisations, such as schools, to channel their volunteers to community organisations in a mutually beneficial way. They also assist community partners with volunteer management, through efforts such as holding joint volunteer training sessions for community partners that may not have the capacity or the know-how to do so.We have been working closely with several SSAs, such as Loving Heart Multi-Service Centre and Filos Community Services to helm our SG Cares Volunteer Centres in Jurong East and Bedok respectively. Over the past two years, these SSAs forged over a hundred partnerships with corporates, schools and other SSAs. We commend their hard work and invite more community-based organisations to partner us.Care is also manifested by ensuring that spaces are inclusive and providing opportunities for all to enjoy pursuits such as sports. Ms Yip asked about updates to our Disability Sports Master Plan (DSMP). She shared suggestions to expand play opportunities for persons with disabilities (PWDs) and build partnerships to promote inclusivity in sport.The three key thrusts of the DSMP remain relevant and we are making progress on its recommendations. We currently have eight inclusive and senior-friendly gyms with equipment suitable for use by all, including PWDs. SportSG plans to retrofit three more gyms each year over the next three years. By 2026, all ActiveSG gyms in Singapore will be inclusive and senior-friendly.We will continue to work with community partners on inclusive programmes. We are expanding events, such as Play Inclusive, an inclusive sports competition, to offer more opportunities for persons of different abilities and special needs to train and compete in sports together. We are also supporting Goalball Singapore to bring sighted and low-vision students to play sports together.A Communities of Care grant has been introduced to support ideas to uplift the vulnerable and under-served through sport. We are disbursing $600,000 to support 18 community projects and 31 SportCares bursary recipients this year. SSAs are welcome to apply. SportSG also offers guidance to staff of SSAs to introduce inclusive sport activities.We are developing two frameworks to guide Special Education schools and SSAs on cultivating a lifelong enjoyment of physical activities for their students and clients. The adaptive swim framework focuses on teaching basic swimming and water safety competencies and the Fitness 1-2-3 framework focuses on imparting strength and conditioning knowledge.The DSMP also provides opportunities to participate in High Performance Sports, as Ms Yip suggested. Individuals with potential from ActiveSG and community sports programmes are referred to the Singapore Disability Sport Council and the National Disability Sports Associations for further development and training. The Singapore Sport Institute (SSI) also provides facilities, funding and specialist support for para athletes preparing for major games.I thank Ms Yip for her suggestions to build on the momentum of the DSMP. We will follow up with her on her ideas.We also want to support our charities and encourage giving through this time when we are all fighting COVID-19 as one. Donations to Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs) will continue to be matched via the Bicentennial Community Fund until December 2020, from March 2020 previously.This year, we are also introducing sector-specific digital solutions for smaller charities to operate more efficiently and more securely. These solutions aim to reduce administrative burdens, improve productivity and provide higher protection against cyber threats. Charities will also receive a digitalisation toolkit to expand their digital knowledge and capabilities.We are also simplifying the process of searching for charities' information on our charity portal to help donors make informed giving choices. Each charity's profile page, starting with those that are IPCs, will feature information about how well the IPC is governed, for example, its level of regulatory compliance. We will be engaging charities and the public on what information should be shared, and how it can be presented in a useful way later this year.The giving culture is strong in Singapore, and we want to sustain it and grow it further by encouraging those interested to give through a new national legacy giving initiative, developed in partnership with CFS.Legacy giving refers to a planned, future gift that designates a portion of a person's assets as a donation to charity. Examples of such assets include cash and insurance policies. Our goal is to foster a giving mindset, where planned gifts to charity become more common and more frequent.This is not just about bestowing financial assets. Legacy giving also imparts values such as kindness, compassion and generosity, which are far more lasting than assets alone. Acts of care and contribution go a long way, especially in these challenging times.Mr Chairman, MCCY will continue to pursue partnerships to uplift those in need and nurture an active citizenry. Together, we can build a democracy of deeds as our legacy to future generations.The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng): Mr Chairman, the arts, heritage and sports play an important role in making Singapore a vibrant and liveable city. They bring people together, inspire them and root us as Singaporeans.Earlier, Minister and Senior Minister of State spoke about our efforts to build a home that provides opportunities for all. This is exemplified through the celebration of different pathways to success for our artists and athletes and the nurturing of a vibrant arts and culture ecosystem.The partnership among the Government, arts patrons and arts community forms the basis of a sustainable arts scene. Mr Henry Kwek and Mr Terence Ho asked how MCCY will support the arts community during COVID-19. We want cultural performances to continue during this time as the arts inspire us and lift our spirits, as long as necessary precautions are in place. This is what MCCY agencies and institutions, including NAC, NHB and PA will commit to, where possible. We also want to encourage arts and culture practitioners to take this opportunity to develop their capabilities and better position themselves for the future. MCCY will therefore set aside around $1.6 million to support the arts and culture sector and to prepare the sector for the post-disease recovery.MCCY will provide a new 30% subsidy for venue rental and associatedcosts at our national cultural institutions. including the Esplanade, Arts House Limited venues, and the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre. This subsidy will be for arts and culture activities, including productions and workshops taking place from 7 March, tomorrow, to 30 June.In addition, NAC will provide a one-time, enhanced capability development grant for individuals and arts organisations, to promote upskilling and organisational capability development. The grant will be open for application from 16 March and will subsidise local courses and programmes.These two initiatives are part of the Support and Stabilisation Package announced by Deputy Prime Minister in Budget 2020. Arts groups and practitioners, including those who already enjoy subsidised rentals under NAC's arts housing scheme, can benefit from both these initiatives. The package also the new self-employed persons' (SEPs) training support scheme recently unveiled by MOM. Under this, all SEPs will be paid an hourly $7.50 training allowance when attending eligible programmes. NAC will continue working with SkillsFuture Singapore on a curated list of arts and culture courses for arts freelancers. This will complement existing initiatives, like the Arts Resource Hub, which is working with partners to provide shared services in areas like legal and financial matters.We encourage all eligible arts and culture professionals to tap on the available measures, including subscribing to the Arts Resource Hub, which is free, and prepare themselves for the post-COVID-19 upturn. As Mr Ho suggested, we encourage arts practitioners to support one another during this time.SportSG is also engaging stakeholders, especially coaches and fitness instructors to use this time to retool and upskill through various courses offered by CoachSG and partner institutions, supported by SkillsFuture Singapore and SkillsFuture Credits. Sports coaches registered with the National Registry of Coaches (NROC) can apply for financial assistance under the Coach Development Grant to attend courses and programmes to upgrade themselves. MOM's SEP training support scheme will also benefit these sports freelancers.We will also ensure that our arts spaces are effectively used. Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked for an update on the Gillman Barracks Art Cluster. Gillman Barracks provides Singaporeans and tourists access to high quality arts programmes through educational art and history tours, performances, as well as talks and workshops by long-term tenant galleries. This includes the current edition of the Singapore Biennale, which had tours led by seniors and concerts by students from Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Two successful editions of SEA Focus in 2019 and 2020 also enhanced Gillman Barracks' standing as a locus of Southeast Asian Art.Mr Terence Ho asked if we will provide more shared spaces and resources to bring people together via arts activities. To facilitate networking and to optimise available spaces, arts practitioners will have access to our arts centres. In January, we opened two physical spaces under the Arts Resource Hub at Goodman Arts Centre and Stamford Arts Centre. Plans are underway to have a third physical hub at Waterloo Street by early 2021 that will offer incubation and presentation spaces for arts freelancers.These plans complement schemes like the Community and Sports Facilities Scheme to provide artists with greater access to spaces. I encourage more arts groups to consider how they can pool their resources. Those with existing facilities, for instance, could share them with others.Mr Chairman, technology will also be used to strengthen our arts eco-system. NAC is collaborating with NLB to develop a National Online Repository of Singapore Arts to facilitate access to information on Singapore arts and deepen the expertise of arts researchers.This will complement other digital platforms, such as the Cultural Concierge and Offstage, which seek to widen the public's engagement with the arts.Sports also plays a crucial role in strengthening our community bonds.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked about our plans for a sporting Singapore. As part of Vision 2030, SportSG is partnering stakeholders to develop a strong sporting culture and grow our standing as a major sporting hub through local and international events, such as the Singapore Rugby 7s, FINA World Cup and the Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon.The GDP contribution of the sports industry has grown steadily, reaching $1.7 billion in 2018. This figure excludes growth areas like sports broadcast, infrastructure projects, sports events and conferences, as well as e-sports, which SportSG, Enterprise Singapore and Singapore Tourism Board and local and international businesses have been seen working together to develop the e-sports scene.1.00 pmMr Chairman, the Singapore Sports Hub hosted 212 events last year. The precinct has seen increased footfall, with regular activities such as quarterly Community Play Days and a variety of programmes. Like many Singaporeans, we want to see it succeed as the integrated sports and lifestyle destination that we envisioned. Regarding the acquisition of majority stakeholder InfraRed Capital Partners by Sun Life, we recently sought clarification from Sports Hub Private Limited (SHPL) and we have obtained their assurance that this will not have any direct impact on the Sports Hub operations.We have made our views and expectations known and SHPL agrees that Sports Hub should be a place that all Singaporeans can be proud of. SportSG is in regular communication with their top management and closely monitors performance to ensure that agreed standards for availability of facilities and performance are met. For example, SHPL is required to meet a minimum number of sporting event days at the National Stadium and Singapore Indoor Stadium each year. Where they have not met the standards, they have been held accountable and financial penalties have been imposed. We will continue to monitor and hold SHPL accountable to meet all their contractual obligations to deliver a first class and vibrant sports entertainment and lifestyle hub for all Singaporeans.Mr Darryl David asked how our athletes have fared internationally, how we are supporting our younger elite athletes and athletes who are competing in locations with a high rate of COVID-19 infections. Twenty-nineteen was a busy year for our athletes. I attended the 30th Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines where we fielded 659 athletes and achieved more than 50 gold medals.On the international stage, shuttler Loh Kean Yew beat two-time Olympics champion Lin Dan to win the Thailand Masters last year, and he defeated the world number two shuttler at the Badminton Asia Team Championships in February. Bowler Cherie Tan made history by becoming the first Singaporean to be named the World Bowling Athlete of the Year by World Bowling last year.In para sports, swimmer Yip Pin Xiu clinched two medals at the 2019 World Para Swimming Championships while archer Nur Syahidah Alim became the first Singaporean to be named Para Women World Archery Athlete of the Year for 2019.Looking ahead, we now have more than 10 athletes across six sports who have qualified for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics; and nine para-athletes who have qualified for the Paralympics.These athletes are supported through the spexScholarship programme or dedicated campaign funding for the games, as well as annual Government funding through the National Sports Associations. Specialised sport science and sport medicine support is also provided to help them achieve their best.For athletes going overseas, SportSG, together with the Singapore National Olympic Council and the Singapore National Paralympic Council, have developed detailed contingency plans to ensure the safety of our athletes and officials. The contingency plans for Tokyo 2020 are being developed and will include measures and precautions for athletes and officials with regard to COVID-19.We will also enhance our sporting infrastructure to support our youth athletes. The National Youth Sports Institute (NYSI) satellite facility will move to a bigger facility at the former Police Coast Guard Headquarters, next to the Kallang Basin in April. This will allow NYSI to scale up sport science support for more youth athletes. The new premises will be close to Singapore Sports Institute (SSI) and the Sports Hub where many athletes train, thus providing opportunities for interaction between the junior and senior athletes.Ms Yip Pin Xiu shared that she has seen many athletes face mental pressures from their sport and their daily lives. This also applies to retiring athletes.To ensure the mental well-being of athletes, the SSI sports psychology team has been equipping our athletes with skills to adjust to life post-competition and a post-sport career. They offer counselling services and a mental health literacy programme, Mind Matters, that helps athletes and coaches identify and understand mental well-being issues as well as when and how to seek help. We note Ms Yip Pin Xiu's comment on the programme's limited reach. SSI is working to expand the reach of this programme to benefit more athletes as well as partners under the spexBusiness network to offer professional development support and opportunities for retiring athletes.Our athletes can also look out for one another. I encourage our retired athletes and veterans to take the lead to build circles of support, lend a listening ear, offer advice and help one another.Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap asked about our plans for the Singapore national football team qualifying for World Cup 2034. The Government does not interfere with the management of our National Sports Associations, including the Football Association of Singapore (FAS). We were briefed by FAS on the plans for Goal 2034 and have given FAS feedback. We look forward to hearing back from them on their plans and how we can best support them.Supporting our athletes and artists is a shared endeavour. We have funds to encourage private and corporate philanthropy for the arts and sports, reinforcing the Singapore Together movement. Mr Terence Ho and Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked about the Cultural Matching Fund (CMF) and One Team Singapore Fund (OTSF) respectively.Since it was set up in 2013, the Cultural Matching Fund has benefited over 100 arts and heritage charities through one-for-one matching to over $215 million of private donations.We recognise that smaller arts groups may need more help as they lack strong fundraising capabilities. We will help these groups with the new Sustain The ARTs Fund, or stART Fund for short. This fund will bring together donations from corporations and individuals, which will be matched by CMF where eligible, to support small arts groups in developing robust governance structures and attaining charity and eventually Institutions of a Public Character (IPC) status as well as programming. Over the coming three years till 2022, NAC plans to build the stART Fund to $10 million, which aims to support about 100 arts groups. All eligible donations will receive prevailing tax deductions. Interested donors can reach out to NAC.In the sports arena, the One Team Singapore Fund (OTSF) complements the Government's investment in the high performance sports system by allowing individuals and corporates to make cash donations. The Government has set aside $50 million to match cash donations to encourage more to step forward. We wish to clarify that similar to other Government matching funds, the OTSF does not provide matching for commercial arrangements like sponsorships as the fund aims to encourage philanthropy to sport.But we are mindful that there are athletes outside the high performance sports system such as our indoor skydivers, national dodgeball and tchoukball squads who have done well in internationally. We want to support their aspirations. So, with support from Temasek Foundation, $100,000 will be set aside annually for a Temasek Foundation Inspire Fund for Athletes that will provide campaign funding for such athletes. More details will be announced in the coming months.Mr Chairman, I have spoken about how we are supporting our artists and athletes. Our efforts cannot stop here.We agree with Mr Lee Yi Shyan that arts and culture should be accessible to Singaporeans. Since 2012, we have established 21 arts and culture nodes across the island to provide quality arts programmes in our neighbourhoods. Through programmes such as PAssion Arts, Arts in Your Neighbourhood and Artseen, we have co-designed community arts programming with the community and other partners. We have also brought arts and culture outside the confines of concert halls and museums and into public spaces during events such as the Istana open house. Through NAC's Silver Arts Programme, we have arts programmes designed for seniors.To provide youths with opportunities to showcase their creative talent and energy, NAC has partnered *SCAPE to roll out the BUSKING@*SCAPE programme. Under this programme, Singaporeans between 15 to 35 years old are not required to go through auditions or be endorsed under NAC's Busking Scheme. Instead, they can register for time slots to busk at the prominent *SCAPE front-of-house which faces Orchard Cineleisure. The scheme was piloted from October last year. To date, more than 60 young buskers have showcased their talents.To provide buskers with greater access to spaces, NAC will gradually introduce the concept of busking zones at Singapore River and Ang Mo Kio from April this year. Each zone comprises a cluster of busking locations, allowing buskers the flexibility to move between them. This offers a more varied busking experience for audiences and ensures equitable access to popular busking spots.NAC will continue to engage venue partners and the busking community to review busking locations, manage busking activities and co-develop suitable programmes. I hope my fellow members will also offer your constituencies for buskers to perform.NAC will also develop a digital scheduling tool for buskers to pre-book their performance slots. With this, members of the public and venue partners can look forward to more vibrant spaces and a diverse busking calendar.Mr Darryl David asked about community engagement efforts to safeguard our cultural heritage. We will do this in partnership with the community, through public education and outreach, research and documentation. This year, there are two highlights – the Stewards of Singapore's Intangible Cultural Heritage Award and the outcome of the UNESCO Hawker Culture in Singapore nomination in December.The safeguarding, promotion and transmission of our intangible cultural heritage (ICH) will not be possible without the contributions of our ICH practitioners. These individuals will be honoured at the inaugural Stewards of Singapore's Intangible Cultural Heritage Award ceremony held in conjunction with Singapore Heritage Festival this year.Over the past year, we were heartened by the strong support from the community for our UNESCO Hawker Culture in Singapore nomination. We will continue to strengthen community support through platforms such as the Singapore Heritage Festival, community events and travelling exhibitions to schools to celebrate our hawker culture. We are lucky to have hawkers who continue to work tirelessly to serve Singaporeans amid this COVID-19 period.Beyond shared stories, traditions and practices that are passed on from generation to generation, our heritage is also embodied in historical buildings and neighbourhood icons. We will partner local shop owners within Singapore's historic precincts to co-create Street Corner Heritage Galleries and highlight heritage right in our neighbourhoods.NHB museums, heritage institutions and community galleries will partner local shop owners to create \"mini museums\" within their shops to showcase their history and heritage, trades and products through information panels, displays of historical documents, photographs and artefacts. The Street Corner Heritage Galleries may also develop programmes, such as tours and workshops, and participate in events such as Singapore Heritage Festival and the respective Culture Festivals of the heritage institutions.Balestier will be the first precinct, with five Street Corner Heritage Galleries opening to the public from tomorrow. Loong Fatt Tau Sar Piah along Balestier Road will host one such gallery. With a history dating back to 1948, visitors to the family-run business can watch the stallholders mould the dough, stuff with mung bean filling and bake using traditional gas-fired ovens. We have prepared some tau sar piah for tea later.By 2022, there will be Street Corner Heritage Galleries in four other historic precincts – Kampong Gelam, Kreta Ayer, Little India and Geylang Serai. These places will serve as reminders of our living heritage and anchor our memories as we move into the future together. Mr Chairman, I will continue in Mandarin, please.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Singapore's rich history and diverse heritage belongs to every Singaporean. To sustain a culturally vibrant Singapore, it is important that we safeguard and promote our nation's rich and diverse intangible cultural heritage, as this defines our identity as Singaporeans and it is a duty we must fulfil. Beyond our shared stories and knowledge, our heritage is also embodied in our neighbourhood icons. In order to bring our heritage to neighbourhoods where we live and play, museums, heritage institutions and community galleries operated by NHB will partner local shop owners to co-create Street Corner Heritage Galleries. These local shops will function as \"mini museums\" to showcase their history and heritage, trades and products through displays of historical documents, photographs and artefacts. We hope to encourage people to appreciate the heritage embodied in their daily lives through the lens of our heartlands.While our efforts to preserve and promote our intangible cultural heritage are ongoing, we have also diligently planned for the future by working on the succession of our heritage. There are risks threatening our local cultural heritage, traditional skills and craft, such as a lack of awareness or lack of interest in learning and passing them down. Through the inaugural Stewards of Singapore's Intangible Cultural Heritage Award which will be held this year, we hope to acknowledge the recipients' contributions and encourage them to continue safeguarding and transmitting intangible cultural heritage in their respective fields to the next generation. Over the past year, we have been heartened to see strong support from the community for our UNESCO Hawker Culture in Singapore nomination. In the coming year, we will continue to build community support through different platforms to celebrate our Hawker Culture. We will continue to safeguard and promote our intangible cultural heritage through different channels and plans, ensuring that more Singaporeans may come to understand and appreciate it.(In English): Mr Chairman, at MCCY, we are committed to providing opportunities for all, growing a democracy of deeds and nurturing a vibrant home. Our work covers a wide range of areas – arts, heritage, youth, sports, community relations and the strengthening of a giving culture. At its heart, our efforts seek to make Singapore a caring, cohesive and confident nation.There is much we can achieve by working hand-in-hand and by encouraging individuals and groups to come together for the common good. Let us continue to celebrate our collective achievements and build a shared future together.The Chairman: Clarifications. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah: Thank you, Sir. I have five supplementary questions. I am very happy that this time Yishun is being mentioned by Minister. 我们终于榜上有名.The Chairman: Yishun is always mentioned all the time. [Laughter.]Er Dr Lee Bee Wah: My question is: what is budget for this Yishun Sports Complex project. I hope if it is not as gorgeous as One Tampines Hub, at least it is something comparable to our neighbour, Sembawang Integrated Hub.Question number two, a master plan to grow the sports industry was developed during 2005 to 2010 thereby resulting in positive outcomes. It was developed with EDB, STB and so on. I would like to ask what is the progress of this master plan to build upon the past success, activate from a huge investment of the sports hub and capitalise on the new opportunities that exist in our shores.And the third question, with the substantial monthly unitary payment paid by Government to Sports Hub Private Limited versus Sports Hub's contractual performance and ability to meet the expectation of Singaporeans, do you believe that this national icon is value-for-money so far? Please explain your rationale.Question four, according to existing and potential hirers —The Chairman: Is that a clarification or a question?Er Dr Lee Bee Wah: Yes, the clarification is that there is a lack of event in the Sports Hub calendar that attribute to the high rentalcost and high variablecost, according to the industry feedback. Has Sports Singapore spoken to this group of stakeholders – that means those who wanted to rent the place – and conduct a benchmarking to assess whether the pricing charged by Sports Hub, is it fair or not?And last question, what is the role of ActiveSG? Is it to generate and encourage mass participation at the grassroots level? If so, then why is ActiveSG stepping into the arena of elite sports? Example of this include football where ActiveSG is running elite programmes and also in tennis, where ActiveSG is running at elite academy with Voyager from Australia. These programmes undermine the role of the respective NSAs. So, why is ActiveSG involved in this?Mr Baey Yam Keng: Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked about the sports industry. SportSG Vision 2030 seeks to inspire Singaporeans to live better through sports and as part of the eco-system there is indeed the industry's contribution to economy, as a culture of sports in Singapore. So, there are various platforms and initiatives including ActiveSG as the national movement of sports to engage our people and rally the nation, facilitate the master plan.But you must also take note that the sports industry is also an evolving landscape. There are many new interesting developments in sports, like we mentioned e-sports. We have recently set up the National E-sports Association. That is also in response to the interest among young people, interest among the corporates, local and international businesses. So, we will continue to monitor the emerging trends in sports.So, for example, sports development in Asia, its growing interest with China's growth as a global sports power, in the manufacture of sporting goods and the foray of Chinese companies into sports enterprises. So, we are looking into such opportunities for Singapore arising from these trends into developing an eco-system that can support sports business development and how we can further leverage on SportSG infrastructure and assets to nurture a market place for ideas and innovations with stakeholders.At Sports Hub, there is a commercial contract that we have with SHPL. So, as mentioned, there are deliverables, there are penalties that are part of the contract. So, they have been taken to task over areas where they have not met the KPIs and we are in continuous discussion with them, monitoring their performance and having their assurance that they are committed to building a sports hub, as what we envisaged.I would like to see that Sports Hub will have value-for-money for Singapore. It is our national sports icon and we hope that Singaporeans would also participate in activities at the Sports Hub to help build a strong sporting culture for Singapore.ActiveSG's role is to promote the sporting culture. Member asked about the academies in football and tennis. These are academies' initiatives and programmes that SportSG initiated to bring sports to more people but working closely with the respective National Sports Associations.I do not think it is a fair statement to say that when you have renowned or very established coaches involved in the academy, it means that it is just elite sports and, therefore, it is at the expense of high performance sports training and development. I do not think mass or public sports should be denied good coaches, people who have the ability to bring the sports to a higher level and also to cultivate interest among especially young people.The Chairman: Dr Lim Wee Kiak.Dr Lim Wee Kiak: I have two clarifications. One for Minister is regarding our submission of the hawker culture to UNESCO for this December. We are all eagerly waiting for the results. Can I ask the Minister what are our chances of getting this as well as what can we do now, as Singapore together, to increase our chances?The second clarification is on the ActiveSG Credits – whether MCCY will be considering topping of the ActiveSG Credit. Because some of my residents have used up their credit and they are looking forward to the Sembawang Integrated Sports Hub which is now called Bukit Canberra, just mentioned by Er Lee Bee Wah just now. They are hoping that they can use their credit there.I am very happy to hear that those above 65 now will have free admission to the gyms as well as the swimming pool. But why 65? Can MCCY bring it lower, to 50? Because exercising early, from the doctor's point of view, is important for health.Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The question on hawker culture, the process now is in the hands of UNESCO. To be very frank, they will go through their internal assessment. There is nothing we can do as a country to influence or affect the process. But I think there is a lot that Singaporeans can do to continue to support hawkers and hawker culture in Singapore. Many of them deserve our support, whether it is by patronising them or showcasing them or just giving them the kind of exposure that they so deserve. When there is good food, I am sure we will tell each other about it. So, continue to support and give them good business.I think we are also trying to, in a way, make our hawker centres a lot cleaner, particularly in this period of time. That is also an important part of hawker culture – it is not just the food but also the place. How do we have a new standard of public eating spaces in our hawker centres? So, it is also something that Singaporeans should think about.The second question about Active SG Credit, we had hoped the free admission will have addressed the Member's request. But I think why 65 – we thought that is a good age, timing with how we see our lives, getting into retirement age and having more time on your hands. It is really a good time to get into an active lifestyle and we hope that ActiveSG gym and swimming pool will be part of the lives of those 65 and above.In general, I think we are looking at ways to encourage Singaporeans to adopt an active lifestyle. When they are young, we are doing as much as we can in the schools, starting this time round, as you can see, our efforts will go into the pre-school sector, getting the teachers involved, getting the programme instituted at the pre-school level, and also getting the parents at the pre-schools involved as well.So, it is really to try to work along the wide range of ages to access sport opportunities, with customised and appropriate measures for each age range.The Chairman: Yes, Mr Alex Yam.Mr Alex Yam: Chairman, I have four supplementary questions.The first one on the Orchard Youth Belt which I believe Senior Minister of State Sim Ann said that Senior Parliamentary Secretary would mention. I am not so sure I caught that part of the answer. Will there be delays because of the current economic situation and what are the broad plans forward?In relation to sports, again to the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, yesterday there was quite a stark commentary on the state of sports in The New Paper, written by Leonard Thomas. I echo some of his concerns. I would like to ask what are the plans that SportSG and the Ministry have to increase attendance at sports events, especially for competitive sports, and to raise the support level overall, especially for our traditional sports?I also heard the Senior Parliamentary Secretary say earlier that Ministry and the SportSG does not interfere in the running of the NSAs. Leonard also mentioned in his article that, and I quote, \"I can't help but feel some undercurrent of distrust between NSAs and SportSG.\" So, I would like to ask what is the type of oversight that SportSG has over the NSAs, especially over drafting of their constitutions, rules and regulations on elections and renewal of their management committees.Mr Baey Yam Keng: On the Somerset Belt, last year we went through a long process, engaging many youths on developing a master plan for the Somerset Belt as a place where youths can gather, realise their aspirations. We have completed the work. We were planning to announce it a few weeks ago. But because of the COVID-19 situation, we thought that it may not be a good thing to have that kind of announcement. So, we are planning for some time later this month.Following that, we will also be doing some pilots for the type of programming, activities that would rejuvenate the Somerset Belt; programmes that are relevant and interesting for young people throughout the year. So, it is an evolving plan and we look forward to more youth engagement and participation to help us further develop and realise the master plan.Mr Yam also asked about how we could increase the interest of the public in competitive sport events, especially with the attendance numbers. I think that is where we would first like to develop a strong sporting and interest in sports, as a whole, as a nation.1.30 pmFor specific events, we will then have to work closely with the event organiser or the respective NSAs on how to make their sports spectator experience a meaningful and interesting one.SportSG has worked at the national-level events, to institute a certain format of the venue atmosphere in terms of how athletes are introduced as they enter the courts or the match venue, in terms of the results announcement, and medal presentation – these have all helped to make it look more professional and also sustain the interest among public.We also work with the schools because a lot of the students do enjoy the sporting competitions at the school level. So, we hope that we will continue to be able to work on this to make it such that going to sports, cheering for athletes would become a way of life for many of our Singaporeans.As to the relationship between Sport SG and NSAs in areas where Sport SG provides funding for the NSAs to roll out their respective programmes, I think that is where we have the biggest interest because we are using public money, taxpayers' money for sport NSAs.Therefore, things like governance where it is not reflected in the constitution or where there is a lack of rules and regulations or by-laws that does not assure the Government of a structure to make ensure proper accountability, that is where Sports SG will take a keen interest and even direct certain changes in the NSAs.As to the other programmes, we would leave it to the NSAs to set the targets, to roll out the programmes as long as it is beneficial for the sports scene. In areas where public money is concerned, we would definitely take a much closer look.The Chairman: Ms Anthea Ong.Ms Anthea Ong: Thank you, Chairman. Could I ask the Minister to elaborate her response to my cut on OSF. On behalf of the many ground-ups, the many community builders, they would like to know if the Ministry would be keen to review OSF in the three areas that I mentioned earlier.Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: I would like to thank Ms Anthea Ong for their suggestions. Like we do here, we always listen to suggestions from Members carefully, and I am sure we will go back and take in these suggestions as we review the scheme.Having said that, OSF is a fund that will encourage as many ground-up projects and groups as much as possible. So, the structure is set low, with low hurdles so that it is easy to get but the amount generally is kept low – for a purpose because we want to encourage as many as possible to access the funds.If we were to have it for multiple years of a much larger sum of funds, then obviously I think the Member would appreciate that with the importance of being a custodian of Government funds, we would then impose more rules.MCCY is also in the process of harmonising the rules of the grants. We are bringing several grants under the Government – not just MCCY but over several Ministries – under one umbrella. That is really to address some of these issues that the Member and Mr Irshad have raised earlier on about having to go to multiple agencies.I would also like to explain that while OSF is the place to go to for Singaporeans if they want to start a ground-up or a new project, we are really not the domain experts for many of these projects. Very often if the project is going to take a longer life, if we are going to invest more time and effort into expanding or deepening the project, then it is inevitable that we have to rope in our sister agencies or Ministries to take a look on the efficacy of the project.So, I would like to urge Members to bear with us when you see bureaucracy. We want to keep it as simple as possible. But if the project requires more funding over a longer period of time, I think it is only reasonable to expect more questions and more KPIs.The Chairman: Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.Mr Sitoh Yih Pin: Thank you, Sir. Sir, I need to declare my interest as the immediate past President of the Singapore Wushu, Dragon and Lion Dance Federation. But my question is not on that. My question specifically is on football. [Laughter.]I hear the Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned about FAS' Goal 2034 and he mentioned that Government does not interfere in NSAs and you appeared to say that the ball is in FAS' court. I think Goal 2034 – as a football fan myself and like many Singaporeans here – I find it awesome and most inspiring and I think many Singaporeans do look forward to the even to the old days where we can go back to the Kallang Stadium for the Kallang Roar. So, may I ask what is MCCY's position on Goal 2034? Whether you are supporting it and if so, how are you supporting it?Mr Baey Yam Keng: Goal 2034 is a goal set by FAS. It is not a goal set by the Government. So, the role of the Government is to support NSAs where possible. We have asked FAS for a briefing on how they aim to achieve the goal. We are in a discussion and we have given some inputs that they may want to look at their mid-term and long-term development plans for youths in order to achieve Goal 2034.I understand that FAS has taken the feedback and they are in the midst of talking to other stakeholders to further refine this vision. We look forward to FAS sharing plans on how it would achieve or aim to achieve Goal 2034.The Chairman: Ms Yip Pin Xiu.Ms Yip Pin Xiu: Thank you. I have three clarifications. The first one is with regard to the cut on mental health for athletes. Is it possible to consider having a trained clinical psychologist in the picture because some issues need a bit more than counselling or just general programme. And sometimes athletes need these professionals to also understand high-performance sports. So, it might be a bit harder for them to go outside and seek help.Next, on the One Team Singapore funding, I understand that the Ministry wants to encourage philanthropy towards sports. However, is it also possible if a programme can be developed for corporates to see the value and potential in sports so that they can possibly allow sports in Singapore to thrive and be a bit more sustainable.And lastly, referring back to my cut, is it possible for Sports Singapore to set up a challenge fund for NSA integrations for those NSAs that have already raised interest?Mr Baey Yam Keng: I thank Ms Yip for her suggestions. On how we can better improve the mental well-being support for athletes or retired athletes, she suggested having a clinical psychologist to be part of the team to provide such services. Let us discuss with the team to see how we can further enhance the expertise so that our athletes can benefit from that kind of services. I thank her for that.As for how we can help NSAs to develop fund-raising capabilities, beyond sponsorships, I think that is a key area of expertise that we would also like to see in our NSAs. Not only NSAs, our arts groups as well to have the ability to look for and retain their sponsors, their donors and how to promote philanthropy for their sector as a whole. So, our funds, CMF or OTSF is just a catalyst to encourage that and we would look at how we can provide more support to enable our NSAs to develop that kind of capability. The Member had one more.Ms Yip Pin Xiu: NSA integration.Mr Baey Yam Keng: Integration. Yes, integration between the main sports and the para sports. I think the challenge fund is something we could look into to promote integration. Ultimately, it is up to the respective associations, whether they want to work together, and I know that sometimes they also take guidance from their International Federations. But we would pay more attention to this.The Chairman: Dr Lim Wee Kiat, would you like to withdraw your amendment?Some hon Members: We still have questions.The Chairman: Yes, but I have no time. Thank you. [Laughter.]Dr Lim Wee Kiak: Mr Chairman, I would like to thank all 19 hon Members of this House for participating in thisCOSdebate. On behalf of all Members of the House, I would like to thank Ministers Masagos and Grace Fu, Senior Ministers of State Maliki Osman and Sim Ann as well as Minister of State Zaqi Mohamad and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng for their replies. I would like to express our gratitude as well as appreciation to all men and women at MCCY, all stakeholders and partners in arts, youths, sports and community for their efforts in bringing all Singaporeans together as one nation, one Singapore. On that note. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $1,889,177,900 for Head X ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $390,036,800 for Head X ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.1.41 pmThe Chairman: I shall now deal with the remaining Heads of Expenditure in respect of which no amendment stands on the Order Paper Supplement. In respect of the Main Estimates, they are Heads C, D, E, F, G and Z. I propose to take those Heads of Expenditure en bloc.Question, \"That the sums stated for Heads C, D, E, F, G and Z which appear in the last column of the schedule of estimated expenditure under the Main Estimates on page 6 of Paper Cmd 24 of 2020 stand part of the Main Estimates,\" put and agreed to.The Chairman: In respect of the Development Estimates, they are Heads C, D, E and F.Question, \"That the sums stated for Heads C, D, E and F which appear in the last column of the schedule of estimated expenditure under the Development Estimates on page 7 of Paper Cmd 24 of 2020 stand part of the Development Estimates,\" put and agreed to.Question, \"That the sum of $108,398,100,400 shall be supplied to the Government under the Heads of Expenditure for the Public Services shown in the Main Estimates for the financial year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, contained in Paper Cmd 24 of 2020,\" put and agreed to.Question, \"That the sum of $32,539,083,600 shall be supplied to the Government under the Heads of Expenditure for the Public Services shown in the Development Estimates for the financial year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, contained in Paper Cmd 24 of 2020,\" put and agreed to.The Chairman: Resolutions to be reported.Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the House.1.45 pmThe Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah): Mr Speaker, I beg to report that the Committee of Supply has come to certain resolutions.First Resolution reported –That the sum of $108,398,100,400 shall be supplied to the Government under the Heads of Expenditure for the public services shown in the Main Estimates for the financial year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, contained in Paper Cmd 24 of 2020.Second Resolution reported –That the sum of $32,539,083,600 shall be supplied to the Government under the Heads of Expenditure for the public services shown in the Development Estimates for the financial year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, contained in Paper Cmd 24 of 2020.Ms Indranee Rajah: Mr Speaker, I beg to move, \"That Parliament doth agree with the Committee on the said resolutions.\"Question put, and agreed to.Resolutions accordingly agreed to."

        "Content": "ADJOURNMENT MOTIONThe Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"Question proposed.Working Together Towards a Zero-suicide Singapore6.47 pmMs Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): Mr Deputy Speaker, please allow me to read the struggles of Lucy, not her real name, and her suicidal thoughts to this House. I quote verbatim: \"I have been a witness to a suicide, I have lost a friend to suicide and I struggle with suicidal ideation on a near daily basis. Itcost me my university education, landed me in tens of thousands of dollars in debt, and left me with little means to earn enough to pay back my study loan and survive on my own. I will likely never be able to earn more than $1,000 per month and will likely take my life than die of other causes in the near future.\"Other than Lucy, there were 46 more people who came forward to share with me about their experiences with suicide, among the 400 respondents to the public consultation on mental health conducted by my team and I. Like Lucy's and the many near and far ones who have reached out to me, each and every one of their stories was heartbreaking to know and read, as they agonised over their struggles to live.Suicide is a global public health concern. Close to 800,000 people lose their life to suicide every year, nearly one-third of which occur among young people.Here in Singapore, teenage suicides peaked in 2018 – the highest since suicide tracking started in 1991. Sadly, so did the number of elderly aged 60 and above who took their own lives. From 2017 to 2019, there were 1,204 attempted suicides yearly. Last year, the Immigration and Customs Authority reported that there were 8.36 suicides per 100,000 Singapore residents in 2018, up from 7.74 in 2017. Suicide has entrenched itself as the leading cause of death for those aged 10 to 29.Sir, these worrying numbers could be higher, given issues of under-reporting. According to the Attorney-General's Chambers, a classification of \"suicide\" only occurs when there is clear evidence of suicidal intent and self-harm. From my interactions with suicide-bereaved parents, the cause of death is sometimes categorised as \"fall from a high place\" or \"unnatural death\" and also labelled as such on the requests of family. In addition, we must also not forget that for every suicide and attempted suicide we know, there are many more people struggling with self harm and suicide ideation that we have little data on. In fact, estimates from WHO show that for every suicide, there may have been more than 20 suicide attempts that go undetected.So, whilst some may argue that our numbers are not high by international standards, we are still not doing enough because the number of deaths by suicides in Singapore has remained relatively unchanged from 9.5 suicides per 100,000 residents in the 1980s to 8.3 suicides per 100,000 residents today.How have we managed to develop from a third-world to first-world country and yet not be able to successfully tackle this issue of suicide? How is it that we still have the current number of suicide deaths we have today? One large reason might be the disappointing fact that Singapore was not listed as one of the few \"high income\" countries with a national suicide prevention strategy even though we are a member state of WHO – because we do not have one! National suicide prevention strategies are essential for working towards the ultimate goal of suicide reduction. According to WHO, such a strategy is important as it indicates a government's clear commitment to prioritising and tackling suicide, while making resources available for necessary interventions.Mr Deputy Speaker, Senior Minister of State Amy Khor's assurance at Budget 2020 that a whole-of-Government review of our mental health strategy will be undertaken to identify gaps and strengthen existing inter-agency efforts brought much hope to many who are struggling. Building on this, I hope to use the rest of this speech to ask the Government to go further in developing a national response that aims for zero suicides under this review as part of a multi-ministry and multi-sectoral effort.But first, let me take this opportunity to address the discourses about suicide. It is a common fear that talking about suicide could encourage suicide behaviour, hence many friends and families who are concerned about their loved ones in distress often struggle with asking about suicide ideation or intent.Similarly, Minister Ong Ye Kung shared his concerns in this House that talking about suicide numbers in schools \"may heighten suicide risk in vulnerable youths\". While I appreciate the intention of these concerns, I would like to point out that youths today already consume a large volume of media online related to mental health and suicide. Youths have shared with me that schools often try to keep quiet about students who died due to suicide, but this backfires as students are often already in the know about their peers' mental health and suicidal intention. The expert consensus is that, to have a chance at preventing suicide, we must talk about suicide responsibly.Earlier this month, Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong indicated that allowing for treatment for self-inflicted injuries in MediSave or MediShield Life could encourage suicidal behaviours, although exceptions could be made for those with existing mental health conditions. In this House, a few colleagues expressed their concerns last year that decriminalisation of suicide could send the wrong signal in incentivising suicide. These views perpetuate the stigma by shrouding suicide in exclusion. Experts indicate that incentives for help-seeking are helpful in combating stigma, allowing those who are struggling to feel more comfortable in seeking support.Mr Deputy Speaker, apart from poor mental health that Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong gave concession to, we must also recognise that there are social and environmental factors embedded within our society and structures that also contribute to an individual's intention to self harm or suicide or to take their own life. Intense feelings of hopelessness can also arise from sudden and adverse life events including unemployment, trauma and the loss of loved ones. Not every suicide is a result of mental illness, nor is someone with mental illness always suicidal.Lastly, we must take the lead in recognising that suicide is far from a selfish choice and cannot be blamed on the individual. My cousin, who has attempted suicide several times, often shares that he feels that he's a burden to his family, including me, even as he acknowledged that he knows how much we love him.Studies have shown that people who attempt to take or took their own lives commonly feel that their lives hamper others, viewing their decisions as relieving their loved ones. The following excerpt of a suicide letter from an elderly victim broke my heart, I quote: \"Father is reluctant to leave all of you. I have failed so badly that I have no choice.\" This is the reality of suicides, and those who succumb can hardly be labelled as selfish.Mr Deputy Speaker, as recommended by the WHO, it is fundamental for the Government to lead and coordinate efforts in suicide prevention, starting from the establishment of a national strategy, to show this Government's priority in tackling suicides. This should first start from identifying currently available resources and committing further resources and funding to improve suicide prevention and efforts to support individuals struggling with suicide. One example would be to expand funding for organisations like SOS, the Samaritans of Singapore, not just to operate our de-facto national suicide helpline, but to ensure timely follow-ups with callers who need further support. We should also consider increasing resources and funding for mental healthcare services to address wait time and patient load issues.I am deeply alarmed that our public hospitals do not track whether an admission is due to attempted suicide. Yet, studies show that 83% of people who die by suicide visit some kind of doctor a year before their death. Hence, healthcare facilities, especially emergency facilities and departments, are a logical place to prevent suicides. By getting our hospitals to track suicide attempts, our national strategy is better placed to coordinate the continuity of care for these suicide attempters. In the mould of the Zero Suicide Initiative, we must ensure that on the individual level, that we acknowledge each person's pain, empower them to make safe decisions and on the systems level, build hope for recovery with a continuity of care approach across agencies.We should also note that since the decriminalisation of suicides, data of suicide attempts is no longer required by the Criminal Code. Without data surveillance of attempted suicides, our ability in developing informed strategies is limited.Through a national strategy of data surveillance coordinated across Government agencies and community partners, the transparency and awareness of the support available can be improved, allowing various stakeholders better position their role and plan their work in tackling suicides. A robust framework of monitoring and evaluation is also required, thereby instilling a sense of accountability among those in charge of interventions.We have a crisis on our hands with the spike in teenage suicides. I would like to lend a voice to the suicide-bereaved mothers of the PleaseStay. Movement. They believe there needs to be clear and strong suicide prevention and post-suicide intervention protocols in schools. Despite their inconsolable grief, they came forward to share what they believe could be done to prevent more teen suicides so that other parents do not have to go through the same pain. Families and friends, especially other students in the school, will inevitably suffer from grief and trauma to varying degrees and urgently need this post-suicide intervention support.Many education systems such as the state government of Victoria in Australia establish step-by-step guidelines on what to do in the event of a suicide attempt and/or in an occurrence of suicide, making them publicly available as part of a whole-of-society effort. Notwithstanding the peer support networks that Minister Indranee cited in response to my question in Committee of Supply (COS) on MOE's suicide prevention strategy, I am sure we all agree that laying out clearly MOE's suicide protocols to parents and students can only help confront increasing suicides amongst teens.Mr Deputy Speaker, as much as the Government must take the lead in suicide prevention, the complex and multi-faceted nature of suicide means that all of us are a part of this national response towards zero suicides.Studies show that 50% to 60% of all persons who died by suicide gave some warning of their intentions to a friend or family member. One mother from the PleaseStay. Movement shared she was not aware that her 11-year-old son was suicidal until it was too late. Young people have often asked me what the warning signs are and how they can help their friends.We need more public education programmes in schools, workplaces and communities on suicide prevention 101, including learning these warning signs: from unusual and sustained changes in actions, to actions like withdrawal, loss of interest, words like verbal statements such as \"Everybody will better off without me\", \"What is the point of living?\", and feelings – guilt, hopelessness; also, biological and physical aspects like poor sleep and loss of appetite.Key gatekeepers like police, teachers, grassroots leaders and more must also be trained in suicide first-responder training so that they can intervene appropriately for suicide attempts. Community support groups like the SOS as the first community responder, or the PleaseStay. Movement and new groups like Caring for Life are key stakeholders in this whole-of-society effort to reduce and prevent suicides.However, without a national strategy for these efforts to align to, we risk having a fragmented and sub-optimal approach to supporting survivors and bereaved parents.Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to conclude by imploring the Government to take action now to arrest the rising suicide numbers by initiating a National Suicide Prevention Strategy with a vision towards a Zero-Suicide Singapore, together with community partners and citizens. We must stand firm in the belief that suicides are preventable and commit to the efforts in making that possible.Why zero suicides? Because unlike any other targets – like 2020 for gender equality, 30 by 30 for food security – that we have made in this House when it comes to loss of lives; human lives, nothing short of zero has ever been good enough for us. A Zero-Suicide Singapore as a goal joins the Vision Zero aspiration of our workplace safety and health policies and the Zero Accident movement in our public transportation policies too.And we would not be alone. The United States aspires towards a nation free of the tragedy of suicide in its national prevention strategy. Japan envisions a society where no one is driven to take their own life. South Korea wants to create safe and healthy communities free from suicide. And last but not least, Sweden’s Vision Zero Policy which was ratified by its parliament in 2008 aims to build a nation where no one should be in a situation of such vulnerability that suicide is seen as the only way out.Mr Deputy Speaker, as they say, if we fail to plan, we plan to fail. And we most certainly must not fail our people like Lucy. We must work together towards a zero-suicide society that cares because every life matters. To Lucy and those of you who are struggling with suicidal thoughts out there, please know this: \"You are not a burden nor are you alone. Yes, the world will be a better place in it. Please stay.\"Mr Deputy Speaker: Senior Minister of State Amy Khor.7.03 pmThe Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan): Mr Deputy Speaker, MOH is committed to mental well-being and suicide prevention and to this end, Singapore adopts a multi-pronged approach.Internationally, based on WHO's 2016 age-standardised death rates, Singapore’s age-standardised death rates from suicide – 7.9 per 100,000 resident population – is lower compared to not just countries like South Korea at 20.2 and Japan 14.3, but also countries like Finland and US – 13.8, and 13.7 respectively. It is also lower than the annual global age-standardised suicide rate of 10.5 per 100,000 population. In Singapore, the number of suicides involving 10- to 19-year-olds fluctuated from 13 cases in 2014, 27 in 2015, 22 in 2016, falling to 12 in 2017 and rising again to 22 in 2018. The number of elderly suicides has declined from 126 cases in 2014 to 115 cases in 2018 despite an ageing population.Nonetheless, we recognise that every suicide is one death too many and we have and will continue to strengthen our strategies to prevent suicides, as guided by the National Mental Health Blueprint and Community Mental Health Masterplan.Through partnering Ministries and agencies, we have adopted a multi-prong approach to suicide prevention based on the following key strategies of building mental resilience; encouraging help seeking and early identification; supporting at-risk groups; and providing crisis support.We have also invested in resources for mental health as well as put in place monitoring and tracking mechanisms to evaluate the effectiveness of our programmes.As noted by Ms Ong, there are social and environmental factors that contribute to the individual's intent to self-harm. Therefore, our strategy targets upstream protective factors in addition to strengthening downstream supportive services. Suicide prevention and intervention strategies have been developed in schools, workplaces and in the community. Let me briefly highlight our many efforts under the four key strategies.As part of suicide prevention strategy, MOE has focused on upstream efforts to build students’ social and emotional skills and resilience through the school curriculum, CCAs and various programmes. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) also offers mental well-being programmes to equip students with the skills to cope with stress, overwhelming emotions, interpersonal conflicts, change and transitions.At the workplace, HPB conducts mental well-being roadshows and workshops to provide stress management tips and techniques to employees. MOM’s Workplace Safety and Health Institute, in partnership with other agencies have developed an assessment tool, iWorkHealth, as well as a website to help workers identify workplace stressors and resources to improve one’s mental well-being.Under the National Seniors’ Health Programme, HPB organises healthy ageing workshops that include psycho-social education modules aimed at empowering our seniors aged 50 years and above with the knowledge and skills to manage their mental well-being.Early identification and encouraging help seeking are vital for suicide prevention. Hence, we have invested in raising mental health literacy through training and education programmes. Beyond SOPs, school teachers are trained to identify students experiencing distress, provide timely support and refer students in distress to school counsellors or mental health professionals for further interventions. Peer support structures are also being established in schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) by HPB as well as MOE.The Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT) offers easy access to mental health resources and help via different avenues for young persons between 16 and 30 years old. Young persons may either visit the CHAT hub, log onto CHAT’s online portal for its WebCHAT service or call CHAT’s hotline.Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) conducts programmes on how to identify suicide warning signs and where to seek help.The Agency of Integrated Care (AIC) has been working with community-based organisations to set up Community Outreach Teams to reach out to seniors with or who may be at risk of dementia or depression.Anti-stigma efforts play an important role in encouraging persons in distress to seek help early. Hence, in 2018, the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) rolled out a multi-year public education campaign, called \"Beyond the Label\" to achieve this objective. NCSS also recently launched the Beyond the Label Helpbot, Belle to make access to mental health information and resources to the community easier for the general public.We recognise that persons who are greatly distressed and attempt to take their own life requires help and the criminal justice system may not be the best option. As of 1 January 2020, attempted suicide is no longer a crime in Singapore. However, the Government will continue to track reports of such cases. Additionally, public hospitals are working on tracking attempted suicide cases that they attend to.There are a range of services in place to support at-risk groups of all ages in our community. For instance, we have trained Silver Generation Ambassadors to identify seniors who live alone, and to proactively offer them befriending services, identify and escalate cases with mental health needs.We also have services in place to support persons in distress who require assistance such as Institute of Mental Health (IMH)’s 24-hour mental health helpline and the SOS' hotline which is funded by NCSS.I agree with Ms Anthea Ong that every life matters, and we will continue to strengthen our efforts. During this year’sCOS, MOE shared that they will feature mental health education in the revised Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and MOH will also be setting up an Integrated Youth Service (IYS) in Woodlands this year.MOM has also announced their intention to work with tripartite partners to develop a Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-being. In addition, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) has recently clarified that companies should not ask for declaration of applicants’ mental health conditions unless there is a job-related requirement.We have established platforms for a coordinated interagency approach to suicide prevention. For example, the Inter-Agency Research Workgroup for Youth Suicides, brings together agencies to study the issues surrounding youth suicides and to facilitate deeper collaboration between the various agencies. The workgroup will be sharing their recommendations, for agencies to follow up later this year.Since February this year, more than 800 people from different walks of life responded to Minister Desmond Lee’s open call and will have an opportunity to be part of the Youth Mental Well-being network to be established. This Network brings people together to identify opportunities and gaps to work on, to improve youth mental well-being.There is no easy solution to suicide prevention as the causes are complex and multifaceted. Even as we undertake a whole-of-Government review to enhance our efforts, a whole-of-society approach is necessary to build mental resilience in order to prevent suicide in Singapore.Mr Deputy Speaker, even as we celebrate life, we all know too well that it can sometimes be stressful and challenging. COVID-19 for instance poses yet another huge test for all of us, not least in mental resilience. Beyond the Government’s resources and support as well as the many community programmes and efforts, I urge my fellow Singaporeans to stand together, look out for each other, develop strong empathy and reach out your hand to others to uplift them.Only together, can we ensure each other's mental well-being, especially in such unprecedented times.On this note, let me conclude by thanking the Member for her selfless efforts to promote mental well-being and prevent suicides. Let me assure her and all Members of this House that the Government, too, will not let up our efforts on this front. [Applause.]Question put, and agreed to.Resolved, \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"Adjourned accordingly at 7.13 pm."

        "Content": "Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [Allotted Day].[Mr Speaker in the Chair]5.43 pmThe Chairman: Second Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, contained in Paper Cmd 28 of 2020.I shall deal first with the Heads of Expenditure in respect of which amendments stand on the Order Paper Supplement. Head M, Ministry of Finance.Head M – Ministry of FinanceThe Chairman: Ms Anthea Ong.Transnational Families and Migrant SpousesMs Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".Low-income transnational families have been particularly hard-hit by COVID-19 and circuit breaker measures. According to an AWARE survey with migrant spouses of Singaporean citizens in May, 99% of 36 respondents have either lost their jobs or seen a drastic decrease in income since the onset of COVID-19. Close to half were not earning any income from work because their jobs did not allow them to work from home.Migrant spouses are particularly vulnerable in times of economic crisis as they are often the first to be let go, especially since COVID-19 related job support schemes do not provide incentives for employers to retain non-citizen workers. Can the Ministry consider funding an online platform to facilitate job-matching for these workers at a national level so that employers looking to hire overseas workers could be encouraged to hire from this pool, which includes migrant spouses, first?This widespread loss in income is making it difficult for many migrant spouses and their families to meet basic needs. They can receive a $300 one-off Solidarity payment but only if they are on LTVP+. Even so, this amount may be insufficient. According to AWARE's survey, more than half of the respondents reported that, in addition to their current household income, which mostly falls below $2,000, they still need more than $300 a month to meet their basic needs. To cope, some have cut down on food-related expenses; a few said they were unable to pay rent.5.45 pmCan the Government consider relaxing the citizenship criteria for COVID-19 related financial assistance and make them available for all migrant spouses with aSingaporean in their household? Only when we include those who have chosen to make Singapore home and help raise our children can we truly say we are “SG United”.Question proposed.The Chairman: Minister Indranee.The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah): Mr Chairman, if I may now address Ms Ong’s questions on support for transnational families and migrant spouses.The support schemes announced at the various Budgets aim to provide support to Singaporean households, including those with non-citizen members, who may be concerned over household expenses during this period. These include household-based benefits like GST Voucher – U-Save rebates and Service and Conservancy Charges Rebate under the Care and Support Package, and the Solidarity Utilities Credit. Transnational families would already be receiving support through the $600 Solidarity Payment to the citizen member, and $300 Solidarity Payment to the PR or LTVP+ spouse. This was explained by the Deputy Prime Minister during the round-up of the Solidarity Budget and in response to a Parliamentary Question from Mr Murali Pillai last month.If they or their Singaporean family need further financial support during this challenging period, they may seek help through the MSF Social Service Offices (SSOs), which provide assistance to those who fall into financial hardship. MSF has exercised more flexibility when considering ComCare applications during this period, to ensure affected Singaporean families, including those with non-citizen members, can get help. SSOs will also work closely with other agencies and partners to address the family’s needs, including employment concerns. There are also many Social Service Agencies and those in the community providing support to families in need. These include Social Service Agencies funded by MSF to support transnational families.Migrant spouses who are allowed to work can access work opportunities through many channels, including job advertisements, referrals, recruitment agencies and various online platforms.The Chairman: Would Ms Anthea Ong like to withdraw the amendment?Ms Anthea Ong: Mr Chairman, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $3,650,000,000 for Head M ordered to stand part of the Second Supplementary Main Estimates.Head O–Ministry of HealthThe Chairman: Head O, Ministry of Health. Ms Anthea Ong.Emerging Stronger MentallyMs Anthea Ong:Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head O of the Estimates be reduced by $100.”As Singapore extends safe distancing measures to protect lives, we must remain aware of how doing so leads to not only “costs” for our economy and businesses, but real and significant detriments to our mental health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed “widespread psychological distress” in COVID-19 affected populations, with mental distress being reported in 35% of the population surveyed in China and 45% in the United States.A similar picture of a “mental health pandemic” is being observed in Singapore. In an Ipsos survey of 1,000 Singaporeans between late April and early May, one in four respondents said they were not in good mental health. Our national suicide prevention hotline, operated by the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), received 23% more calls in April from March. Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL) has shared with me that their caseloads have significantly increased in the last three months, with many care-givers reporting increases in mental health relapses and crisis incidents experienced by their care recipients, four of them have even lost their loved ones to suicide just in the last six weeks.To deal with the psychological fallout from COVID-19, countries like New Zealand and Scotland have relied heavily on mental health experts in their COVID-19 response. The extended safe distancing measures for Phase One of exiting the circuit breaker is likely to prolong mental distress, as we continue to deal with social isolation, the lack of personal space, and disruption to routines. Would the Ministry consider appointing mental health experts for the Multi-Ministry COVID-19 Task Force, to advise on mental health implications as we extend the stringent safe distancing measures to re-open cautiously?Singapore’s economic woes are likely to continue for the long term, as GDP growth forecasts have been downgraded from -4% to -7%. As the resident unemployment rate climbed to a 10-year high of 3.3% in March, a survey by Profile Asia indicated that many employees are facing increased levels of stress dealing with uncertainty over future pay cuts and their jobs.Deputy Prime Minister Heng talked about seeking out “opportunities in adversity” during his Fortitude Budget Statement. The COVID-19 crisis also offers us an unprecedented opportunity in equipping businesses and workers for the rebound through improving workplace wellness. A recent report has linked business recovery from COVID-19 to a sustained focus on employee well-being. Would the Ministry consider appointing at least one mental health expert on the Emerging Stronger Task Force to advise on well-being policy interventions to strengthen our recovery from this crisis?Question proposed.The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor.The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan): The mental health of our nation is important, and the Government is committed to taking care of the mental well-being of Singaporeans, especially during this COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic has resulted in increased stressors that impact our mental well-being, given the changes in daily routines, social isolation and economic uncertainty.Hence, more support needs to be put in place to address the mental stress that the COVID-19 pandemic and circuit breaker measures have brought about. The Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) recognises this and has been tapping on mental health professionals from MSF, MOH and MOE to give inputs on the psychological aspects of COVID, and in the enhancement and development of mental health initiatives.Our public healthcare institutions (PHIs) continued to provide essential mental health services during the circuit breaker period. Some of our community mental health partners continued to conduct urgent home visits for vulnerable clients and those at risk of self-harm, harm to others, or at-risk of deterioration. Tele-consultations were also adopted by PHIs and community service providers so that they remain connected with their clients to ensure their mental health needs are supported.A specific initiative developed is the new 24-hour National CARE Hotline (NCH). The NCH, which came into operation in April 2020, is manned by volunteers comprising trained psychologists, counsellors, social workers and other professionals, and provides support to the larger community on mental health concerns, such as anxiety and adjustment issues related to COVID-19.For employees, MOM, along with other agencies, such as MSF, AIC and NCSS, issued an Inter-Agency Advisory with practical steps to support employees’ mental well-being and provided counselling resources for employers and workers to tap on.For students, school counsellors continue to support those in need through face-to-face and online sessions. Vulnerable students were actively identified for further support and invited to return to school during the CB period. MOE also provided students with Holiday Care Packs containing resources and helplines on mental well-being and cyber wellness.For the elderly, the Silver Generation Office reached out to some 47,000 vulnerable seniors to refer them to assistance as required, including befriending and mental health services. As we gradually ease movement restrictions, we have also paid special attention to addressing the well-being of seniors. The decision to allow children to visit their parents or grandparents is one example.The Emerging Stronger Task Force (EST) was set up primarily to develop recommendations on how Singapore should refresh, reimagine or reset its economic strategies, to stay economically resilient and build new sources of dynamism in the post-COVID-19 world. Hence, besides the two co-chairs, the remaining members are industry representatives. Nonetheless, the EST has committed to consult multiple stakeholders to draw on insights beyond its membership.MOH, together with the relevant partners and agencies, will continue to ensure that mental health support and services are accessible to persons in need. We will take into consideration the impact of COVID-19 on mental health as we undertake a whole-of-Government review of our mental health strategy and study ways to further strengthen our community mental health services to support new vulnerable groups that may emerge due to COVID-19.The Chairman: Any clarifications?Ms Anthea Ong: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for the response. Could I then ask if MOH has the intention to increase funding for these community health organisations? Many of them have actually shared with me that, well, we know that there is a long tail to the mental health impact and they are also sharing that increased funding would really help them in terms of increasing their capacity.Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan: In this Fortitude Budget, MOH has an increased budget to implement many of the COVID-19 management measures. I have no doubt that even as we undertake a whole-of-Government review of our mental health strategies to strengthen mental health services, where there is a need to access additional funding, that could be put into the next Budget, if necessary.The Chairman: Would Ms Ong like to withdraw the amendment, please?Ms Anthea Ong: Chairman,I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $7,000,900,000 for Head O ordered to stand part of the Second Supplementary Main Estimates.Head V–Ministry of Trade and IndustryThe Chairman: Head V, Ministry of Trade and Industry. Ms Anthea Ong.Identifying \"Promising\" Start-upsMs Anthea Ong:Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\"I would like to declare my interest as an impact investor and also founder of social enterprise Hush TeaBar and A Good Space Co-operative. Both are start-ups.The Deputy Prime Minister announced that $285 million will be set aside to support “promising start-ups”. I appreciate that this is a longer term view to maintain our attractiveness and robustness as one of the top start-up eco-systems in the world. However, start-ups are inherently risky and identification of \"promising start-ups\" is often a hit-and-miss endeavour. I know this as an investor and an entrepreneur. Economic downturns often sift the wheat from the chaff, leaving the most resilient ones behind. By intervening in the sifting process, is there a danger of the Government artificially propping up ailing start-ups and distorting market forces? Moreover, an inability to adapt to the changing economic landscape by continuing to rely on Government financing seems to go against the spirit of start-ups.6.00 pmWhat was the reason behind dedicating $285 million to support \"promising start-ups\", which can also tap into the many support schemes for SMEs, over other areas of spending, such as extending greater support to struggling households like public rental waivers? Which immediate concerns or areas of national priority will the $285 million be used to address, for example, climate change? What are the checks and balances in place to ensure that the $285 million will be effectively utilised?Question proposed.The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Dr Koh Poh Koon.The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon): Mr Chairman, start-ups play an important role in our economy. They contribute to the development of new technologies and the rejuvenation of traditional industries. We have set aside $285 million in the Fortitude Budget to provide financing support for promising start-ups. Ms Anthea Ong asked why our start-ups need more help and how we intend to identify the promising ones. In fact, the answer is in her question. The keyword here is \"promising\".Start-ups, especially those that work on cutting-edge technologies, need to be nurtured with long-term patient capital. COVID-19, unfortunately, has sharply curtailed the availability of such capital. The Special Situation Fund for Startups is intended to fill this gap. Other countries like the UK and France have introduced similar measures.Without help from the Government, many high potential start-ups will likely scale back their innovation activities or even cease prematurely. That will be a loss to Singapore and will certainly have a detrimental impact on Singapore's innovation eco-system, which we have painstakingly built up over the years. By helping promising start-ups sustain their growth momentum, we want to maintain the vibrancy of our eco-system and maximise the value of our innovation-related investments.To impose market discipline, the scheme will operate on a co-investment basis with private sector investors that have expertise in assessing the value and viability of start-ups. This will also help crowd in more private capital. These co-investors can also offer industry insights, networks and even mentorships to help our start-ups to succeed better.Mr Chairman, the COVID-19 pandemic presents many immediate challenges. But even as we address the immediate ones, we must not forget to put in place plans for our future, so that Singapore, our companies and Singaporeans can emerge stronger post-COVID-19. Start-ups are a critical part of these plans.The Chairman: Any clarifications?Ms Anthea Ong: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I thank the Senior Minister of State for the response. I am very happy to hear that we will be co-investing in these start-ups. Could I ask the Senior Minister of State if there is a plan in this co-investing to take equity or is that in the form of grants? And if, once the start-ups are on their way to growth, would we then ask for a clawback of the initial investment or grant?The Chairman: You have eight seconds.Dr Koh Poh Koon: Mr Chairman, I thank the Member for the question. Under this scheme, the Government will co-invest in the selected start-ups, together with the private sector, on a one-to-one basis via convertible bonds. A convertible bond is of one of the most expedient instruments to invest into a company in this current COVID-19 situation as discussions on equity valuation can be deferred to the next funding round, hopefully, when the economic situation is better.The Chairman: Would Ms Ong like to withdraw the amendment?Ms Anthea Ong: Mr Chairman, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $1,851,670,000 for Head V ordered to stand part of the Second Supplementary Main EstimatesThe sum of $1,710,800,000 for Head V ordered to stand part of the Second Supplementary Development EstimatesHead S–Ministry of ManpowerThe Chairman: Head S, Ministry of Manpower. Assoc Prof Walter Theseira.Worker Classification and Income SupportAssoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head S of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\"Sir, many Singaporean workers who have lost income due to COVID-19 have benefited from the Government's income support schemes. These help schemes are differentiated between employees, who are eligible for the COVID-19 Support Grant, and the self-employed, who are eligible for the Self-employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS).I believe the Government has sought to address the different needs of each group in designing these schemes. However, the maximum cash assistance quantum at $9,000 is higher for the SIRS than for the Support Grant at $2,400. Inclusion in SIRS is also automatic for qualifying Singaporeans, whereas the Support Grant must be applied for.This difference in benefits has caused some concern among workers who believe that their employment classification – as an employee or as a self-employed person – does not accurately reflect how they work, their control over their income, and their COVID-19 income risks. There are also workers who are not sure which group they belong to.I will give two examples. Our Universities engage adjunct instructors to teach. They are paid on a piece rate per course. This was previously considered self-employment. The Universities were informed this treatment was incorrect. Therefore, the Universities switched to using contracts of service, which made them employees. But the adjuncts are actually still paid on a per-course basis. Nothing has changed about their work. They still lack the income security of full-time or even part-time employees, although they now do get CPF contributions.Another example is that of workers who are unsure of their status. I was told that a hair stylist needed to apply for a COVID-19 income support grant. Is the hair stylist an employee or self-employed? It turns out that this person operates under a reverse commission model. The stylist works in a hair salon, she pays the salon owner a percentage of the revenue she brings in. This sounds like self-employment. But then, the salon owner may believe that the stylist works for them and may impose conditions on how and when they work. These cases often have no formal contract or they have a contract which is poorly drafted. An appeal was made demonstrating self-employment and I believe the stylist got their SIRS payment. But the point is that these work arrangements are not always easy to classify sometimes.Sir, a worker who faces income risks due to COVID-19 needs help, regardless of how they are classified. Can we do more to ensure that help is calibrated to the workers' actual income risks and income level, rather than their classification status? For example, if a part-time or contract employee faces substantial income risks, because they are hired on a case-by-case basis, could they be considered for SIRS benefits instead? We should also review the legal status of different work arrangements. Other countries are exploring an intermediate classification between employment and self-employment for gig-economy workers and those whose work is under the partial control of another. So, really, to cope with the severe shocks induced by COVID-19, we should aim for benefits tailored to income risks, rather than tailored to the classification of the worker.Question proposed.The Chairman: Ms Anthea Ong, you can take your two cuts together.Workplace Adjustments for Mental HealthMs Anthea Ong: Yes, Mr Chairman. Businesses have been hard-hit by COVID-19. Not referenced in the Fortitude Budget is the impact of the pandemic on the mental well-being of employees. I have mentioned earlier that in a survey of business leaders and HR professionals, nearly one in two Singaporeans has had their mental health adversely affected by COVID-19.A recent survey also found that employees without managers attuned to their well-being are 61% more likely to say they have been less productive. Hence, establishing workplace adjustments for mental health must be an urgent priority for business and overall economic recovery. The inter-agency advisory for employers to support employee well-being, which Senior Minister of State Amy Khor alluded to earlier, is a step in the right direction.Protecting jobs is as important as protecting employability, which includes mental well-being. Can the Ministry integrate the inter-agency advisory into the Job Support Scheme (JSS) such that beneficiary employers must demonstrate effort to introduce workplace adjustments to support their employees? I propose that businesses should adopt Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs), mental health insurance coverage for employees and/or other well-being programmes to qualify for JSS payouts in July and October.Also, will the Ministry consider encouraging these progressive well-being practices with further incentives? I propose that the Ministry expands the scope of the Enhanced Work-Life Grant beyond flexible working arrangements (FWAs), for funding EAPs and/or other well-being programmes.Jobs Support Scheme–Mitigating Failure of Trickle-down EconomicsNext cut. The Government has signalled that the COVID-19 Support Grant is an important—sorry, that is the wrong one.The Chairman: It is okay, the clock is ticking.Ms Anthea Ong: Yes, I know. Sorry. I missed that.The intention behind the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to protect jobs and salary is welcome. However, abuse has been ongoing. MOM has received complaints about companies taking JSS monies and not using them to support their employees. It appears that workers have been threatened with dismissal if they complain about their employer's errant behaviour. IRAS announced on 3 June 2020 that employers who abuse the JSS may be charged under the Penal Code and face imprisonment and a fine. I applaud this strong stand against abuse of the scheme. However, I also note that IRAS continues to encourage individuals to report malpractices and abuses of JSS. Despite IRAS' promise that whistle-blowers' identities will be kept strictly confidential, I foresee many cases in which this will pose little obstacles to the employer discovering the identity of the whistle-blower. Some complaints may never make it to the authorities because the employees do not know of the avenues for complaint or are afraid of souring their relationships with their employers. This is particularly true for elderly or lower income employees who will be most affected by the loss of their jobs and are consequently more vulnerable to exploitation.To empower employees to make complaints against errant employers and protect the most vulnerable in our workforce, will the Government consider a strong whistle-blowing protection law similar to the protected disclosures regime in the UK's employment Rights Act 1996 that is adequately communicated to all workers so that they are aware of the channels and feel safe exercising their right to whistle-blow. Further, instead of relying on goodwill, should there be a mechanism to make companies that are unaffected by or even profiting from the crisis return their JSS payouts?The Chairman: Ms Low Yen Ling.The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling): Mr Chairman, as we go through these challenging times, the Government is committed to protecting livelihoods and sustaining businesses. The support provided through the Unity, Resilience, Solidarity and Fortitude Budgets is targeted to help keep businesses viable and workers employed, so that they can tide over this crisis and recover quickly as the economy restarts.MOM, with the support of the four Budgets, seeks to achieve this in three ways, namely: one, ensuring fair support for all workers – both for the employees and self-employed persons (SEPs); two, championing fair employment practices; and three, promoting mental well-being in our workplaces.Firstly, ensuring fair support for all workers. The Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) has cushioned the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the labour market by helping employers to hold on to their employees and continue paying their salaries, even during the Circuit Breaker period.We introduced the SEP Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) to help Singaporean SEPs with less means and family support tide over this difficult period. Although SIRS is means-tested, the Government has taken into consideration that these are unprecedented times. For comparison, usually, about 50,000 SEPs receive Workfare each year. In other words, they are assessed to need more help. SIRS has now benefited over 120,000 SEPs – more than double the usual number of Workfare recipients.6.15 pmWe understand that many SEPs may have seen their incomes fall. Nonetheless, the income criterion serves as a proxy for their ability to save and, therefore, the likelihood of their ability to tide through periods of less earnings.It should also be noted that about 80% of the personal income taxpayers earn incomes below the SIRS criterion of $100,000 a year or about $9,000 a month. In other words, one would have to be in the top 20% taxpayers' bracket to exceed the SIRS criterion.As for the Annual Value (AV) of property criterion, it serves as a proxy for wealth and family support. The Government has similarly sought to cover more people under SIRS. The AV criterion of $21,000 covers about nine in 10 owner-occupied residential public and private properties.We understand that some of the SEPs who exceed the AV criterion may not themselves own these higher-end properties. Rest assured they can still appeal to be considered for SIRS. We will work with NTUC to assess the circumstances on a case-by-case basis and ensure that the scheme helps SEPs who most need it. Even if an appellant is not eligible for SIRS, we will certainly connect him or her with other relevant agencies like the Social Service Offices (SSOs) to offer other forms of assistance.Mr Chairman, in administering schemes and programmes, such as SIRS, the Government has always partnered various like-minded organisations to better serve Singaporeans and our businesses. This is a key feature of tripartism and has served our Singaporean workers very well.For instance, we work with the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) and Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) to administer the Work-Life Grant (WLG). Likewise, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) is our appointed programme manager for SGUnited Traineeships, working with host companies to review and approve the scope and development plans of the proposed traineeships.Other Government agencies, such as Enterprise Singapore (ESG), have also partnered with Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) to administer schemes for companies. In governing these schemes, the responsible Ministries and agencies determine the policy parameters, including the eligibility criteria. The Ministries set clear boundaries within which our partners must operate, and any exceptions would require the Ministry’s approval.Mr Chairman, over the past few years, several Members of Parliament and members of the public have raised concern that some employees could be misclassified as SEPs and, as a result, not received CPF contributions from their employers and other employee benefits, such as leave entitlement. Assoc Prof Walter Theseira also raised this question earlier in his cut.In determining whether an individual is an employee or SEP, the Singapore Courts consider factors, such as the degree of control exerted by the company and its ability to decide on the hours of work. However, given the wide variety of work arrangements today, each case must be evaluated based on the specific circumstances. The Government applies a similar approach to the Courts when assessing the employment status of an individual.To ensure that the employees are not misclassified as SEPs and denied their statutory employment benefits, MOM follows up on complaints – every one of them that we received – and ensures that the employers make rectifications where needed. For example, arising from feedback from adjunct teaching associates a few years ago, MOM worked with our Autonomous Universities to ensure that the CPF contributions and leave entitlements were provided to those working as employees.I understand that during the circuit breaker period, adjunct teaching associates have continued to receive full salaries from their Universities which are supported by the JSS payouts.Secondly, championing Fair Employment practices. The Government has provided substantial support through the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to help our employers retain and pay local workers. Deputy Prime Minister Heng recapped and shared with us that the JSS amounted to $23.5 billion, protecting 1.9 million jobs for Singaporeans. Employers should act responsibly and fairly, and make sure that they are ensuring that their local workers are given wages even if they are unable to work.I want to assure Ms Anthea Ong that the Government takes a very serious view of irresponsible, unfair or fraudulent employment practices, including false reporting of workers' CPF payments by employers to obtain higher JSS payouts. We take a whole-of-Government approach to identify such fraudulent cases. As highlighted in the media release by IRAS on Wednesday this week, there are severe penalties for any attempt to abuse the JSS.I want to assure Ms Ong that workers need not be afraid to come forward to report any infringement of employment laws, because the Employment Act protects them from wrongful dismissal by employers, especially those who seek to punish workers for exercising their rights.Employers who wrongfully dismiss their workers may be ordered to pay compensation or to reinstate workers to their former jobs. Errant employers may also see a withdrawal of Government-paid employment support or suspension of their Work Pass privileges. MOM takes all feedback on employment law infringements very seriously.During this difficult period, workers and employers have to work even more closely together than ever before and strive to maintain open channels of communication. As Mr Louis Ng pointed out, employees may need greater work flexibility to deal with the disruptions that arise due to COVID-19. Likewise, Mr Desmond Choo and Ms Sylvia Lim raised points regarding the challenges of workers, in particular, women, face and how Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) can benefit employers, employees and the society in the long run.FWAs help workers better prepare and better balance their commitments at home and at work, and enable women to remain in the workforce, gain work experience, earn higher wages and assume leadership positions. MOM has been working with the tripartite partners to improve workers' access to FWAs, such as by providing support via the Work Life Grant (WLG) and recognising progressive employers through the Tripartite Standard on FWAs.As a result of COVID-19, many more companies are working from home now and are benefiting from FWAs. We will seize the opportunity to continue this momentum and ensure that work-from-home arrangements are sustained beyond the COVID-19 period. This will not only strengthen business resilience; it will better support work-life harmony for all workers.Thirdly, ensuring workers' mental well-being. As more businesses gradually resume operations, workers will take some time to adjust to the new normal as well as different working arrangements. Since the start of COVID-19, there has been many changes and adjustments. We understand that workers may face additional stress, and some may have mental health challenges. I agree with Ms Anthea Ong that we must look into our workers' mental health as we also seek to protect as many jobs as possible during this challenging period.Ms Ong had suggested that we consider introducing additional requirements to qualify for JSS payouts. However, the intent of JSS is, as I have mentioned earlier, to help the companies retain and pay for local workers. It is to help as many companies stay afloat and keep jobs for Singaporeans. So, really, the JSS is a temporary scheme designed to help companies save jobs for Singaporeans during this period of economic uncertainty. Adding too many conditions would only make it more difficult for the employers to benefit from JSS or, inadvertently, cause a delay in employers getting the urgent help they need. Jobs may be lost if the employers do not get timely help.Instead, we have been working on other ways to encourage our employers to implement progressive practices and workplace adjustments to take care of our workers' mental health needs in the workplace.During the Committee of Supply (COS) in March, Ms Ong will remember that MOM announced that we will formulate a Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-being to educate our employers on basic mental health knowledge and make available the resources to help them. We will work with the tripartite partners to evaluate the possibility of including an Employee Assistance Programme as well as insurance coverage for mental health as part of the upcoming Tripartite Advisory, which will be finalised in the second half of this year.We are also working closely with the various Government agencies and the Labour Movement to provide our employers with resources that can support their workers' mental well-being.Mr Chairman, what I have just shared are ways in which we are supporting our workers and employers to overcome the challenges arising from COVID-19. During the circuit breaker, we have all come across many heart-warming and heartening stories of how businesses, workers and Singaporeans are rallying behind one another as one community. As we slowly reopen the economy and transit to a new normal, I am confident that the unity and the fortitude of our workers and the employers will see us through this crisis and help us emerge stronger together.The Chairman: Clarifications. Ms Anthea Ong.Ms Anthea Ong: Mr Chairman, I thank Senior Parliamentary Secretary Low for her response. I would like to ask if the Senior Parliamentary Secretary could answer my question. Should there be a mechanism to make companies that are unaffected by or even profiting from the crisis return their JSS payouts? That is one. Secondly, I am very heartened that the Senior Parliamentary Secretary is reiterating that employees should come forward because they are protected under the Employment Act, if they have errant employers.How are we actually making sure that this is made known, particularly to the more vulnerable employees, that they have this right? Many of them are sharing with me that they are so afraid to come forward because,first of all, they do not know they have this right and, secondly, they are worried about employers actually making life harder for them.The Chairman: The longer the question, the shorter the answer.Ms Anthea Ong: I will just keep it to two then, Mr Chairman, on your cue.The Chairman: You have 20 seconds.Ms Low Yen Ling: Thank you. I want to thank the Member, Ms Anthea Ong, for her supplementary question. On the first one about whether there are companies profiteering from the crisis. Earlier on, I mentioned that the JSS is targeted to help companies retain and pay their local workers. In designing the JSS, MOF as well as MOM and the various Ministries sought to achieve a balance between targeted assistance and also administrative efficiency, because this is really a crisis period. You want to make sure that the help reach the intended target audience as expeditiously as possible and make sure that we save every job. So, we strike a good balance between targeted assistance and administrative efficiency in designing the JSS.I would like to inform Ms Ong that a large percentage of our firms and local employees, as the Deputy Prime Minister has mentioned, will be severely impacted. And earlier on, when he reminded us that the JSS amounted to $23.5 billion protecting 1.9 million jobs, two-thirds of our SMEs benefit from this. It is really important to provide the support to them. So, the question the Member asked —The Chairman: Kindly wrap up, Ms Low.Ms Low Yen Ling: So, to identify and exclude individual employers from this scheme will certainly need another level or, in fact, a few levels of administrative operations to sift through, especially when the eventual economic impact to them remains uncertain. It may not be administratively efficient to do so. So, I just want to share the balance between providing the help in an efficient way to the target audience vis-a-vis operational complexity. Now, I also want to reassure Ms Ong —The Chairman: Ms Low, can you just wrap up quickly?Ms Low Yen Ling: Yes. I want to assure Ms Ong that any irresponsible or unfair, fraudulent employment practises, including a false reporting of CPF contributions and so on will be dealt with severely and we will not hesitate to take actions accordingly. And we really urge the workers to report such errant employers. The Member will be familiar with our various programmes like Work Right and so on. We do have MOM officers going out not just to big companies, but also to small ones to share with them the rights of our workers, what are their rights under the Employment Act and how they would be protected. So, they need not fear because the Employment Act protects them, especially those who have been wrongfully dismissed.The Chairman: Thank you. Would Ms Ong like to withdraw your amendment, please?6.30 pmAssoc Prof Walter Theseira: Chairman, it is myself who is withdrawing the amendment.The Chairman: That is right. Assoc Prof Walter Theseira.Assoc Prof Walter Theseira: Chairman, I wish to thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for her kind replies. May I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $3,122,917,400 for Head S ordered to stand part of the Second Supplementary Main Estimates.The sum of $59,711,200 for Head S ordered to stand part of the Second Supplementary Development Estimates.Head I–Ministry of Social and Family DevelopmentThe Chairman: Head I, Ministry of Social and Family Development. Ms Anthea Ong.Gaps in COVID-19 Support GrantMs Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".The Government has signalled that the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) is an important piece in the array of COVID-19 welfare schemes by pumping in $800 million as part of the Fortitude Budget. However, I would like to bring attention to several aspects of the scheme that obstruct it from fully meeting the needs of those who need it most.First, its overly strict eligibility criteria. Applicants have to first show that they have lost or will lose income over three months. For those whose initial conditions of no pay leave or reduced income do not reflect at least three months, they will have to wait to become eligible for CSG. This will be the case for most employees, especially lower wage workers, many of whom who do not even have a document from their employers spelling out conditions of leave. It would be inconceivable to expect employers who lay off employees to provide a confirmation that the employee will have three months of income lost, nor is it logical to expect individuals to show loss of future income of at least three months now.From May 2020, there is no interim support scheme that can help to tide such individuals over. Further, the amount and duration of support provided under CSG is ungenerous, especially when compared to the Self-employed Persons Income Relief Scheme (SIRS). Crucially, members of society in precarious positions are excluded from CSG, such as individuals with no bank account or daily-rated workers.Hence, I recommend that the Government reduce the required period for involuntary no pay leave or duration of income loss from three consecutive months to one month and allow individuals with no bank account and daily-rated or ad hoc workers to be eligible for CSG. The duration of support should also be extended from three months to nine months or when applicants are able to secure a job, whichever is earlier.If the Ministry disagrees, individuals who have been financially affected by COVID-19 will be forced to apply for ComCare financial assistance in the interim or after they have exhausted their full CSG payout. Given the almost five-fold difference in income eligibility criteria of CSG versus ComCare, will the Ministry consider enhancements to ComCare such as: (a) increasing the income eligibility caps for ComCare and (b) increasing the flexibility with regard to supporting documents required? For instance, instead of strictly requiring bank statements, one could be allowed to produce documents that show job or income loss.Question proposed.The Chairman: Senior Parliamentary Secretary Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim.The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim): Mr Chairman, the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) supports lower to middle income Singaporeans or Permanent Residents who, as a result of the economic impact of COVID-19, are presently (a) involuntarily unemployed due to retrenchment or contract termination; (b) placed on involuntary no-pay leave (NPL) for at least three consecutive months; or (c) experiencing reduced monthly salary of at least 30% for at least three consecutive months.While MSF provides support for affected employees through CSG, employees are also supported through the Jobs Support Scheme. Self-employed persons (SEPs) are mainly supported through the Self-employed Persons Income Relief Scheme or SIRS.Employees who have lost their jobs can apply for CSG immediately without waiting for three months.Employees who are placed on involuntary NPL or experiencing reduced monthly salary need not wait till they are affected for three consecutive months to apply. They are eligible for CSG if their NPL or salary loss has already started and they provide supporting documents, such as a letter from their employer, showing that the involuntary NPL or salary reduction will be for at least three consecutive months. The \"three or more consecutive months\" requirement for involuntary NPL and salary loss scenarios is to ensure that help is channelled to those who have greater needs.Daily-rated and ad hoc workers may qualify for CSG if they meet the eligibility criteria. Workers who do not have employment contracts due to the nature of their work may approach their nearest Social Service Offices or SSOs to make a self declaration on their employment status. This includes daily-rated and ad hoc workers. SSOs will undertake further checks against applicants' past CPF records and facilitate their CSG application if they qualify. Individuals eligible for CSG and without bank accounts can approach SSOs for assistance.Those who are ineligible for CSG and are in financial need can apply for ComCare, which provides financial assistance for basic living expenses and other support such as household bill expenses and medical expenses. In general, those who are newly placed on ComCare will receive at least six months of assistance, which provides them with a longer runway to regain stability.For those with urgent financial needs, SSOs, grassroots organisations and Family Service Centres can provide them with ComCare Interim Assistance.ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) and Interim Assistance have income eligibility criteria of a monthly household income of $1,900 and below or per capita household income of $650 and below.The Chairman: Senior Parliamentary Secretary Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, please wrap up.Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim: These are not hard thresholds and each case is considered on its own merit. Supporting documents including bank statements and payslips enable SSOs to accurately assess the applicants' circumstances, savings and needs. SSOs exercise flexibility as needed to provide the necessary financial assistance and social support. SSOs can conduct their interviews and assessments electronically and applicants can submit their supporting documents via email.While CSG is open for applications from May 2020 till September 2020, the Government will continue to review our support schemes for those who need help, taking into account how the COVID-19 situation evolves.The Chairman: Ms Ong, would you like to withdraw the amendment, please?Ms Anthea Ong: Thank you, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, for your response. Mr Chairman, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $1,063,442,000 for Head I ordered to stand part of the Second Supplementary Main Estimates.The Chairman: I shall now deal with the remaining heads of expenditure in respect of which no amendment stands on the Order Paper Supplement. In respect of the Second Supplementary Main Estimates, they are Heads K, Q, T, U, X and Z. I propose to take those Heads of Expenditure en bloc.Question, \"That the sums stated for the Heads K, Q, T, U, X and Z as shown on page 7 of Paper Cmd 28 of 2020 stand part of the Second Supplementary Main Estimates\", put and agreed to.The Chairman: In the respect of the Second Supplementary Development Estimates, it is Head T.Question, \"That the sum of $500,000,000 for Head T stand part of the Second Supplementary Development Estimates\", put and agreed to.Question, \"That the sum of $41,042,104,400 shall be supplied to the Government under the Heads of Expenditure for the public services shown in the Second Supplementary Main Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 contained in Paper Cmd 28 of 2020\", put and agreed to.Question, \"That the sum of $2,270,511,200 shall be supplied to the Government under the Heads of Expenditure for the public services shown in the Second Supplementary Development Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 contained in Paper Cmd 28 of 2020\", put and agreed to.Resolutions to be report.Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the House.Mr Speaker: Minister Indranee Rajah.The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah): Mr Speaker, I beg to report that the Committee of Supply has come to certain resolutions.First resolution to be reported,\"That the sum of $41,042,104,400 shall be supplied to the Government under the Heads of Expenditure for the public services shown in the Second Supplementary Main Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 contained in Paper Cmd 28 of 2020.\"Second resolution to be reported,\"That the sum of $2,270,511,200 shall be supplied to the Government under the Heads of Expenditure for the public services shown in the Second Supplementary Development Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 contained in Paper Cmd 28 of 2020.\"Ms Indranee Rajah: Mr Speaker, I beg to move, \"That Parliament doth agree with the Committee on the said resolutions.\"Question put, and agreed to.Resolutions accordingly agreed to."

        "MPs Speaking": "[The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan), Assoc Prof Walter Theseira, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member)]",
        "Content": "11Assoc Prof Walter Theseiraasked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the studies, projections, orcost-benefit analyses that supported development of the $4.7 million SecureMyBike project at Admiralty MRT that has been discontinued due to lack of demand; and (b) how does the Ministry plan to ensure future walk, cycle and ride (WCR) infrastructure improvementsThe Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan): Sir, the SecureMyBike project is not part of the Admiralty MRT station. It is part of the Kampung Admiralty development, a greenfield HDB project which I initiated in 2012 when I was in MND. The project site was a vacant plot of 9,800 m2– almost 10,000 m2– next to Admiralty MRT Station where HDB had planned to build 2-room Studio Apartments for seniors. We decided to intensify the land use to meet the diverse needs of the potential residential and commercial tenants.I appointed a committee and while the primary objective was to build Studio Apartments for the seniors, I advised the committee to identify the daily needs of the seniors, beyond mere accommodation, so that the seniors could access such needs easily and with little hassle. I envisaged Kampung Admiralty to be a mixed precinct that our seniors would find highly liveable and where neighbours look out for one another, with good old kampung spirit. And that is why we named the project \"Kampung Admiralty\", to help focus the planning.The committee surveyed the needs of the residents in the precinct and sought the views of the many commuters who regularly used Admiralty MRT station. Over several months, they conducted extensive public consultations and organised many focus group discussions with the potential users of this project. Out of a long wish list, the committee finally decided on the range of services to be provided. These included a hawker centre, an outpatient medical cum day surgery centre, a childcare centre, an elderly day care centre, some commercial spaces for shops and restaurants. All these were built, in addition to the Studio Apartments for the elderly as per the original intent of this project. We also made generous provisions for greenery and public spaces to support community gardening, so that the elderly residents living there could live an active lifestyle.We also wanted to make this precinct user-friendly for the many residents who cycle to Admiralty MRT station. There were many surface bicycle parking lots at Admiralty MRT station, but they were not enough during peak hours. The shortage was serious back then, with indiscriminately parked bicycles cluttering the parking area and posing safety concerns. The committee did several counts of the parked bicycles there. They projected substantial, long-term demand for over 500 cycling lots in the vicinity of Admiralty MRT station and proposed to meet the demand as part of the Kampung Admiralty project. We then had to choose between surface parking or underground parking. Surface parking was cheaper to build, but underground parking would free up valuable surface space for other uses; and this is an important consideration in land-scarce Singapore.As Japan faces similar land constraints, the committee studied their experience with bicycle parking and became aware of the extensive underground bicycle parking facilities in their cities. LTA made study visits to Japan to find out more. I myself visited similar facilities in Tokyo when I happened to be there on one official visit. Each facility stored up to 200 bicycles and charged users up to S$35 a month – so, about a dollar per day – for usage of bicycle parking services. My impression was that the Japanese were very satisfied with their paid underground facilities.After much deliberation, the committee decided to experiment with underground bicycle parking in Kampung Admiralty, to see if this model could be financially viable in Singapore. HDB called an open tender for the construction of the entire Kampung Admiralty in 2014 and received six competitive bids. HDB eventually awarded the contract to Lum Chang Building Contractors, which subcontracted the construction, maintenance and operation of the bicycle parking system to a Spanish company, which met the relevant requirements. Implementation was uneventful.The Kampung Admiralty project was completed in 2017. The final plot ratio is 3.6, in line with our intent to intensify land use. We set aside 198 m2– so, that is about 2,000 square feet – for underground bicycle lots, adjacent to the much larger basement car park of about 12,400 m2. So, the bicycle parking lot is less than 2% of the total underground parking space.While Kampung Admiralty was being built, the shared dockless bicycle phenomenon popped up in Singapore! Remember the very colourful Ofo, oBike shared bicycles? We were surprised by the rapid public acceptance and growth of shared bicycles, which led to many problems. By then, I had moved to MOT and had to deal with it, including imposing regulatory controls on the operators. But just as we managed down the shared bicycle numbers, e-scooters came along. The new devices had many advantages and took off quickly, creating new problems which we are now actively dealing with. In fact, two Bills are coming up in an hour's time to deal with this problem.Both shared bicycles and PMDs, especially e-scooters, have dramatically shifted the usage and parking patterns of privately owned bicycles. This fundamentally altered the economics of paid underground bicycle parking. As the fees collected could not cover the operatingcost, LTA decided to end the pilot or the trial.But overall, Kampung Admiralty has been a highly successful project, although the outcome for underground parking for bicycles has turned out to be disappointing. The underground space of 198 m2for bicycle parking remains, and can be re-purposed. We are keeping the options open, as the current situation is still changing. As the number of PMDs comes down, the usage of shared bikes and privately owned bicycles may well rise again. I would not be surprised that similar underground bicycle parking systems may be needed in Singapore, perhaps even at Kampung Admiralty, in the future.Mr Deputy Speaker: Assoc Prof Walter Theseira. There are only three more minutes.Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member): Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the Minister for that reply and I apologise for the mis-attribution in location. I think what it highlights is the difficulty of forecasting demand during market research. So, I think it will be very useful if the Ministry could put in place guidelines for market research studies, even a logic model that has to take place before these projects proceed. And the idea is after the project commences, we can check back against these original projections and see where did we go wrong, where did we go right. That will be very useful because I think it is only now that we are hearing this very excellent story of what actually happened.Mr Khaw Boon Wan: Indeed, we must have that discipline of making sure that you set down clearly what are the planning assumptions so that you can check back after the project is completed. We do that all the time. That is why there is always a project review or a post mortem so that we learn from it. But I think for this particular episode, it is an on-going saga. My last sentence was deliberately crafted. We cannot tell yet how the saga will end; perhaps, in a couple of years' time. I personally think that demand for privately owned bicycles phenomenon may grow, especially as we expand the cycling path infrastructure, a topic which we will discuss extensively at next month's Committee of Supply (COS) for MOT. Stay tuned.3.00 pmMr Deputy Speaker: Order. End of Question Time. Introduction of Government Bill.

        "MPs Speaking": "[Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry, Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M]",
        "Content": "26Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henryasked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether Singapore will stay the course on fighting climate change and meet our climate change commitments despite the current upheavals in the energy market and the potential long-term economic impact arising from the COVID-19 situation.Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The Government's current priority is to manage the COVID-19 outbreak and ensure the lives and livelihoods of Singaporeans, as well as those of our migrant worker community, are well taken care of. We are all in this together and we will spare no effort to make sure that Singapore comes through this COVID-19 crisis much better than before.Even as we continue with our efforts to suppress the outbreak and prepare our economy to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we must not lose sight of the other global challenge of climate change, which remains the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term. As a small island city-state, Singapore remains highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This is why we cannot let up our efforts to address climate change.Recently in March, we released our long-term low-emissions development strategy and enhanced our 2030 climate pledge in support of the goals of the Paris Agreement. They contained bold aspirations and plans to guide our long-term development and ongoing work to effect a well-managed transition to a low-carbon economy. Despite the uncertainties presented by the COVID-19 situation, we decided to press ahead with these plans and submitted them early to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in March, as we wanted to send a strong signal to Singaporeans and the international community that Singapore remains fully committed to tackling climate change. They demonstrate our seriousness and commitment to support global climate action and move towards a low-carbon and climate resilient future. We hope that our early submission to the UNFCCC would encourage other Parties to do likewise and jump-start the process of early submissions, thereby strengthening the momentum of global climate action at this critical time.We also remain committed to climate action and are making good progress on our climate plans. Just last month, Energy Market Authority (EMA) announced that we had achieved our 2020 solar deployment target of 350 megawatt-peak. We are now pressing ahead with our plans to reach our more ambitious solar target of at least two gigawatt-peak by 2030. MEWR will play our part. As earlier announced at the Committee of Supply (COS) 2020, Public Utilities Board (PUB) will be deploying floating solar photovoltaic systems at Bedok, Lower Seletar, and Tengeh Reservoirs by 2021. With this, Singapore will be one of the few countries in the world to have 100% green waterworks.In the face of climate change challenges, Singapore cannot take food security for granted and we have made early moves to prepare ourselves. As early as 2019, my Ministry announced an ambitious \"30 by 30\" goal to produce 30 per cent of Singapore's nutritional needs locally by 2030. The COVID-19 situation has underscored the need to further enhance our food security and resilience. To this end, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has just launched a $30 million \"30x30 Express\" grant call to accelerate the ramping up of local food production over the next six to 24 months.We are also pressing on with plans to protect Singapore from sea-level rise. PUB has taken on the role of the national Coastal Protection Agency from April 2020. With this new responsibility, one agency, PUB, will study both coastal and inland flooding holistically and develop models to guide our flood protection response.To facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy, we are continuing our investment in low-emissions solutions and are partnering the industry and our research community to explore pilot projects to evaluate and improve the feasibility of technologies to drive the decarbonisation of our electricity grid and industrial processes. The Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and EMA have launched energy efficiency incentives and schemes to help our companies to be best-in-class globally in energy and carbon efficiency, and are bringing companies within a sector together to achieve systems-level efficiency gains across the sector. We urge companies to use this period of lowered activities to consider implementing energy efficiency improvement projects where possible, so that companies can be morecost-competitive and emerge stronger when the economy picks up again.As we work to prepare Singapore to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, members of this house can be assured that the Government will keep climate change high as a priority. We will work assiduously to build a more resilient Singapore to withstand the test of future challenges, notably climate change. We encourage all Singaporeans to join us and play their part to \"game change\" climate change."

They comprise School Counsellors, Student Welfare Officers, AEDs in Learning and Behavioural Support (AEDs(LBS)), and AEDs in Teaching and Learning (AEDs(T&L)).Each school is typically resourced with one to two School Counsellors to support the social-emotional and mental health needs of our students, and one to two AEDs(LBS) to provide structured intervention support to students with Special Educational Needs. Some schools also have a Student Welfare Officer to support our students who struggle with attendance issues.Over the last five years, we have grown the number of School Counsellors, Student Welfare Officers and AEDs(LBS) by over 30%, and we intend to expand this further to meet the growing needs of our students. For the existing AEDs(T&L), we are encouraging and also facilitating them to still remain as allied educators, but in the other specialised roles. For example, over the last two years, we have sponsored around 100 AEDs(T&L) to a 10-month full-time Diploma in Special Education (DISE) at the National Institute of Education (NIE) and plan to train another 100 this year.MOE will continue to review our AED numbers and workforce profile to ensure that we respond effectively to students’ needs.Mr Speaker: Mr Leon Perera.Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member): Thank you, Sir. I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answer. Just one supplementary question. There is some anecdotal feedback – it may or may not be the correct perception – that AEDs for classroom support are being reduced in number. Is that actually taking place or are there any plans to do that or is that just an incorrect perception?Ms Low Yen Ling: Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Member for his supplementary question and I also want to assure him that the AEDs form an integral part of our teaching force, to guide the growth and development of our students, especially students with special educational needs. MOE remains committed to deepen and also to expand our mainstream schools' capacity to support our students with special educational needs.On the Member's specific supplementary question on AED(T&L), earlier on, I cited the four types of AEDs. Let me briefly explain the differing job roles and responsibilities. There are four types of AEDs in our schools. First, the School Counsellor provides counselling services to meet the social-emotional and also the mental health needs of our students. The second type is the Student Welfare Officer, who supports students with long-term absenteeism issues and sometimes, is involved in managing their family-related issues as well. The third is the AED(LBS) who provides learning and behavioural support for students with special educational needs, mainly students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), mild ASD, ADHD and dyslexia. The fourth type – the one that the Member specifically highlighted – is the AED(T&L) who provides teaching and learning support for our students in and outside of the classroom.Within the AED pool, we are committed to grow the number of School Counsellors, Student Welfare Officers and also AED(LBS) because we see that they are well-positioned to support the changing profile and the new and growing needs of our students, especially students with special educational needs. The number has grown for these three types of AEDs – it has grown by more than 30% and we are still recruiting. From time to time, MOE will review the profile of our teaching force, including the AEDs. We do need to re-shape the profile of our teaching force, including the AEDs, to be able to better support the changing needs of our students.For example, with smaller student enrolment and with a healthy teaching force, in general, our teacher-to-student ratio has come down, has improved, which also means that now, the teachers rely slightly less on the AEDs(T&L) to provide generic classroom support, than many, many years ago. In order to future-proof our AED(T&L), to better support them in terms of career development, career advancement, we also are facilitating them in terms of taking up the training or even sponsoring them in relevant diplomas, so that they can also take on specialised roles.We are happy to see that in the past few years, AEDs(T&L) have successfully transited to AEDs(LBS). They have done well, also because of their previous experience supporting the teachers in the classrooms.I want to give the assurance that we remain committed to the professional development of our AEDs, including the AEDs(T&L).Mr Speaker: Mr Perera.Mr Leon Perera: I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answer. Sir, just one last supplementary question, really just to confirm if I understood the Senior Parliamentary Secretary correctly, the thinking of the Government is that AEDs(T&L) are less necessary now and therefore, the numbers are going to be reduced and then, those AEDs(T&L) are going to be transited to other roles and so on. I just want to confirm that understanding.Ms Low Yen Ling: Earlier on, I did mention that from time to time, we will look at re-shaping our teaching workforce, including the AEDs. And moving forward, we are looking at ramping up the recruitment of School Counsellors, Student Welfare Officers and AEDs(LBS). For existing AEDs(T&L) who are keen to make the transition or career switch to any of these three roles or even other roles in the teaching force, we will support the AEDs(T&L) in doing so with the necessary sponsorship or diploma courses in NIE or even very specialised courses to support them, so that they can continue to support students – whether it is students with special educational needs or students who need counselling and so on.In the next few days, during the MOE Committee of Supply (COS), we will share more details about how we are boosting the professional development of our teaching workforce, including supporting teachers to better support students with special educational needs."

        "MPs Speaking": "[The Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo), Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang, Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon), Mrs Josephine Teo]",
        "Content": "3Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwangasked the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider increasing the period during which Government-Paid Paternity Leave may be consumed from within 12 months of childbirth to within 24 months of childbirth.The Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Prime Minister): Mr Speaker, fathers play an important role in their children's care and development. For this reason, we have progressively increased parental leave provisions to support fathers in caring for their children. Today, fathers can tap on up to eight weeks of leave in the year after their child's birth, including two weeks of paternity leave and four weeks of shared parental leave.Similar to maternity leave, paternity leave should be consumed within 12 months of childbirth, as it is meant to support working fathers in caring for their infants when they are younger and in need of more care. For this reason, we have no plans to extend it to 24 months of childbirth. This is also in line with international practice where parents are typically required to consume maternity and paternity leave within a few months or up to a year after the child's birth. This is the practice in many countries such as Denmark, United Kingdom and South Korea.After the child turns one, parents can continue to tap on other forms of leave support. This includes six days of unpaid infant care leave per parent per year until the child turns two, on top of six days of paid childcare leave, which each parent can take annually until the child turns seven. Together with tripartite partners, we also encourage employers to provide up to four weeks of unpaid leave per year if their employees have children below two years old who need more care, for example, due to medical conditions. This is a provision under the Tripartite Standard on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, which I must thank the Member Mr Louis Ng for helping to bring about.Beyond leave provisions, the Government will continue to work with employers to better support parents in managing their work and family responsibilities. This includes promoting the adoption of flexible work arrangements and encouraging more family-friendly practices at workplaces.Mr Speaker: Mr Louis Ng.Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): Thank you, Sir. I thank the Minister for the reply. I think what was shocking for me was that in 2018, 65% of fathers in Singapore did not even take one day of paternity leave. I am just wondering whether the Ministry is looking into this further, whether we are looking at Denmark, UK and South Korea – the three countries that the Minister mentioned – what is the take-up rates of paternity leave there and what are they doing that can help increase our take-up of paternity leave.The second clarification is a suggestion, actually. I understand the default arrangement now is that the fathers have to take their paternity leave within 16 weeks of child birth and he has to take it in a two-week continuous block. For any other arrangement, they would need the employers' consent. I am just wondering whether we can make the default arrangement that the fathers can take it anytime within the 12 months of child birth and they do not need to take it in a continuous block. Maybe then, there will be an increase in the number of fathers taking up the paternity leave.Mrs Josephine Teo: Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. The figure of 65%, if I recall correctly, is within a certain period of reporting. What happens is that you need the employers to have submitted the claims in order for the true picture to emerge. So, usually, fathers have one year after the child's birth to take leave and employers have three months after the fathers take leave to submit the claims. So, I would take that 65% in context.The Member asked about the experience in other countries. It is actually very interesting. I still recall visiting Denmark, one of the Nordic countries that is very well-known for its family-friendly policies as well as, overall, very strong support for parenthood. If my memory serves me right, I was myself, quite surprised that their paternity leave utilisation was just about 70%, not higher than that. So, I asked my counterpart to explain to me why this was so. I recall quite distinctly being told that even in a country like Denmark, there are certain sectors, where it is just not considered at the workplace to be very acceptable for the man to go on paternity leave. That is the reason why, even for them, the paternity leave is not closer to 100%.It is quite the case for also a country like South Korea. Paternity leave utilisation is around 3%, very low.What these countries experiences suggest to us is that workplace norms, how accepting the co-workers are and also the employers are, for paternity leave utilisation, that is still something that is being worked on.In the Singapore context, actually we have been making very good progress. Today, the paternity leave utilisation is about 53%, that is not too bad. Within the public sector, the utilisation rate is even higher, about 84%. So, within the public sector, the utilisation already surpasses some of the Nordic countries.What can we do? I think a change of norms, which is something I see happening to a very large extent. You see very many more fathers are involved in the raising of their children. Can we encourage employers to be even more supportive? I think the answer is yes.If I may just make an observation. This is, I think the fifth time you have asked the question about paternity leave in as many months. So, we are happy to answer your slightly different questions. I hope that you are equally happy with our slightly different answers. During theCOS, where we get a chance to deal with marriage and parenthood in a more comprehensive manner, I think we can have a fuller exchange. So, I seek the Member's indulgence for us to take the rest of your questions together in theCOS.Mr Speaker: Order. End of question time."

        "MPs Speaking": "[The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung), Mr Darryl David, Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio), Mr Ong Ye Kung]",
        "Content": "5Mr Darryl Davidasked the Minister for Education how will the period of home-based learning and school closures affect students applying to Secondary schools under the Direct School Admission programme.The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung): Despite the COVID-19 situation, the Direct School Admission or DSA exercise this year will proceed. The timeline for just accepting the applications will be broadly similar to previous years, which is middle of May to early June. But there will need to be some adjustments in how schools evaluate the students.Let me first give some background. Since 2018, we have been making some significant changes to the DSA process and there are three.First, we moved DSA away from being an evaluation of general academic abilities, and instead, focused on specific talents and aptitudes of students. Second, with that shift, we encouraged more schools to participate with their respective niche talent development programmes, and as a result, we expanded the number of DSA places on offer. Finally, we simplified the application process with a centralised DSA portal that allows more students to access DSA opportunities.These changes are part of our continuing effort to recognise students’ abilities for admission to Secondary schools, beyond using PSLE exam results. This is an important shift we are making to the entire education system, moving away from the over-emphasis on examinations and grades, and focusing on what matters to our children in the future, which is their curiosity, passion, ability to learn for life and mastery of their chosen crafts.We will therefore do our best to maintain the same number of DSA placements this year compared to last year, which is about 3,500 placements. In selecting students for DSA, schools will continue to uphold the principles of transparency, objectivity, inclusiveness and student-centricity.However, the evaluation methods will have to change as we need to observe safe distancing measures. We will not be able to depend on traditional selection methods like trials and auditions. Instead, our schools will implement the following measures.First, schools will conduct interviews through video-conferencing tools, which our students, teachers are now all very familiar with. To ensure an even playing field with a common setting and equipment for e-interviews, students will go to their own Primary school to participate in the e-interviews. These sessions will take place from early July to middle of September, so a couple of months away. They will be scheduled and spaced out to avoid inter-mingling of students. Schools may also conduct simple e-auditions in a similar way, for arts categories such as singing, dancing or drama.Second, without selection trials and with the suspension of National School Games, Secondary schools will need to give more recognition to the student’s talent, potential, passion and character through their school track record, and information provided in the students’ online applications. Schools will look out for the student’s demonstrated dedication to a sport and their training attitude, even without a placement in the National School Games. This is not entirely new, but if the circumstances this year force schools to re-evaluate their definition of a good sportsperson, I think it is not a bad outcome at all. Each school will have to decide how it wants to evaluate a student, and apply it consistently and fairly.Third, our Primary schools will step up efforts to encourage students with ability and potential, especially those from less advantaged family backgrounds, to apply through DSA to suitable schools. This will ensure that students from less advantaged backgrounds have equitable opportunities to access DSA. MOE will announce the details shortly.Mr Speaker, Sir, let me just make a final comment. COVID-19 has taken away regular classes, and also our tried and tested methods of grading and DSA selection. But instead of stalling our education reforms, it has underscored their importance and provided impetus for us to journey on.For example, we recognised the importance of digital literacy – we always did – but acceptance of online learning tools and capabilities across schools were uneven, and we therefore needed a fairly lengthy phase-in period that I announced in Parliament during the Committee of Supply (COS). But now having forced everyone into home-based learning, that has helped us overcome that problem almost overnight.We always wanted to emphasise more on Character and Citizenship Education and especially moral education, and COVID-19 has provided us with many important teaching moments.Similarly, we have progressively been reducing the over-emphasis on examinations and grades in our current system. Now, COVID-19 is forcing us to adopt more alternate evaluation tools and make greater efforts to exercise judgement on the potential and character of a child.So, education reforms will therefore continue and so will the DSA exercise, and all the more so this year.Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio): I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply. As a school sportsman who spent more time on the field than in the classroom, I have had been a huge fan of DSA. I am glad to know that DSA will continue for this year. I do understand that there will be challenges for different types of students applying under DSA. For example, it might be easier to arrange for e-auditions and e-interviews for those using the arts or drama.The Minister mentioned something about the students who are participating in sports in lieu of the national sports games or time trials. I am just wondering, Minister, for many of these individual sportsman, especially, the timings of that particular sports would determine sometimes whether or not they are able to qualify for the programme in certain schools.Would the Minister or the Ministry be able to clarify how will the schools be more transparent, perhaps, ensuring that there are some common guidelines or common practices across all the schools with regard to say accepting students who are swimmers, athletes or tennis players in the absence of objective qualifying times, which would have been the case if there had been national sports games or even national time trials.Mr Ong Ye Kung: First, for artistic talent, I do not think the community will feel it is easy to go with e-auditions; it is a challenge. But, also, judgement is involved. When you watch an e-audition, you can judge and evaluate how hard have this child been training, how much effort they have put in, how passionate and dedicated they are. There are also no time trials for arts but you just have to make that judgement. It may have to well apply to sports this year, there being no national games; there is no timing.But this is one of our habits as an education system and as a society as well. We always like to boil everything down to one number and we compare the number, whose number is bigger and smaller and, therefore, you enter. This has the strongest semblance of objectivity, transparency and meritocracy.But on the other hand, if we want to judge a child and bring the child into DSA at the age of 12 or 13, I think we may have to go beyond timings or grades, and to really also put some weight on the child's dedication, how hard he or she trains, and the schools have those records. So, the Member is right, that schools have to dig a bit deeper this year, given the circumstances; they have to come up with alternate criteria and explain them transparently to students and parents, so that they can apply to DSA.At the same time, for students and parents, I also need all their understanding that this year, in the absence of National School Games, some of these qualitative attributes will come into play. And do accept that schools, principals and teachers do have to exercise judgement this year. This is in a way how life is."

        "MPs Speaking": "[Mr Deputy Speaker, The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai), Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast), The Minister for National Development and Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong), The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam), Mr Murali Pillai]",
        "Content": "Debate resumed.Mr Deputy Speaker: Mr Patrick Tay.6.52 pmMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to all aspects of our lives and debilitated the economy. Many businesses are struggling to cope with the on-going impact to their sales and operations, and many workers are struggling with income loss or even job loss. I would like to commend the Government and the team of luminaries for its swift response in drafting the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill, a multi-Ministry effort that offers relief for businesses and provides alternatives for companies, trade unions, societies and other bodies relating to the conduct of meetings.I wish to speak on two specific aspects of the Bill. First, relief for parties who are unable to perform their contractual obligations; and two, alternative measures for the holding of meetings.First, I would like to speak on the proposed measures relating to the performance of contractual obligations. Many businesses are badly affected by the pandemic and have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations. I welcome the proposals to provide temporary relief from legal action for a party to a contract who is unable to perform its contractual obligations because of the pandemic. However, I note that this relief is limited to certain specified contracts only.I have received feedback from one type of business which has not been covered under the Bill – security agencies which provide security services at various buildings in Singapore. Such contracts typically require the agency to pay liquidated damages if it fails to meet various obligations under the contract, such as ensuring that a specified number of security officers are present at the work site each day.Some agencies are unable to fulfil these requirements as their security officers are under quarantine orders or on leave of absence or are unable to come into Singapore as they are Malaysians. I understand that there are cases of service buyers who insist on enforcing their contractual rights by claiming liquidated damages from the security agencies. This imposes a heavy burden on these agencies, which are caught in a bind due to circumstances which are entirely beyond their control.Furthermore, with the closure of most workplaces now, these agencies will most likely face the termination of a number of existing contracts, which will have a further adverse impact on their business and survivability.Security agencies perform a very important service in ensuring safety for the public. I urge the Minister to extend protection and relief under the Bill to security agencies, so that they have a respite from legal action by service buyers during this difficult period.Having said this, I would like to sound a cautionary note. The proposed measures to provide relief under the Bill are fairly extensive and generous. I believe all Singaporeans will recognise that they are a sincere attempt to ameliorate the tremendous pressures businesses face at this time. However, we must also be careful to ensure that they do not go too far, such that while one group is accorded relief, another group becomes adversely affected, or that the measures become subject to abuse. In this respect, I am heartened to note that these measures are temporary and will be in place for only six months at the first instance.Second, I wish to speak on the proposals relating to alternative methods to convene, hold or conduct meetings as required under any written law or legal instrument. Trade unions registered in Singapore are required by their constitutions to conduct various types of meetings or conferences at specified times. For example, many unions which are affiliated to the National Trades Union Congress, of which I am an Assistant Secretary-General, are required to hold a Delegates' Conference, which includes election of the union's Executive Committee, every four years.Prior to that, the unions may have to hold General Meetings at each of their branches, where branch leaders are elected. In addition, their constitutions require them to obtain the sanction of their delegates or members for large items of expenditure or to make changes to their constitution.NTUC has been receiving queries from several of our affiliated unions which are required to hold their Delegates' Conferences or members' meetings this year, and find that it may be difficult, if not impossible, to do so within the time frame mandated by their constitution. I therefore welcome the proposal to allow the Minister to prescribe by Order alternative arrangements for the meeting.The Bill sets out some examples of possible alternative arrangements which may be prescribed. Some of these are more relevant to entities such as companies or trusts. Where unions are concerned, some of these alternatives may not be workable. For example, in the case of matters which need to be decided by a secret ballot, it would not be feasible to allow voting to be done by electronic means at a meeting, as the unions may or may not have systems which provide the levels of security and confidentiality which the Registrar of Trade Unions may mandated.I would therefore like to propose that where unions are concerned, the Minister could provide by Order that the Registrar of Trade Unions, as the regulatory authority, may come up with guidelines relating to alternative arrangements which unions may adopt.In the same vein, besides Unions, there are associations, charities, co-operatives, religious organisations and clans which also have in their respective Constitutions and specified Regulations, process provisions to comply with – in the conduct of AGMs, voting and other meetings for approval of expenditure, leadership change as well as day-to-day operations. A clearer articulation or a set of guidelines for the respective organisations to follow or make reference in these unusual times is welcomed.To sum up, the extraordinary nature of this Bill amidst these extraordinary times call for extraordinary understanding and appreciation by parties, litigants, the legal and judicial system. With that, I support this Bill.Mr Deputy Speaker: Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong.6.58 pmMr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will just respond to two points. The first was raised by Mr Louis Ng, the point about whether the Courts have oversight of why a party may choose not to consent. Let me just explain the framework.Under clause 28, it is an enabling provision. So, the current position under the Evidence Act is that in all non-criminal proceedings, the Court may permit any witness to give evidence by video or television link in remote proceedings. No consent of the parties will be needed in such a situation. This is for all types of witnesses, whether expert or factual.But in criminal proceedings, the current position is that all witnesses must be present in Singapore and the current position is therefore narrower. What the Bill does, is to try to expand this slightly given the current situation by allowing overseas witnesses to appear by remote proceedings if the parties consent. And the reason for this is because, in criminal proceedings, life and liberty is at stake and we want to ensure that the overriding consideration is fairness to the parties. To the extent that there might be some prejudice to the accused person and the accused person does not consent, then in such a situation the Courts are unable to force the appearance of the witness by remote proceedings, and I hope that explains the situation.Mr Patrick Tay asked about unions and the way in which unions might conduct their meetings. I believe I talked about this in my speech earlier as well as about the other types of different meetings that might take place. No doubt, these particular considerations that might apply to one type of meetings or another will be taken into account when the Minister prescribes the alternative arrangements.Mr Deputy Speaker: Minister Lawrence Wong.7.00 pmMr Lawrence Wong: Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Members who had spoken and given their suggestions on the specific provisions of the Bill concerning the remission of property tax. There were some points raised so let me provide quick clarifications.First, whether property owners who had acted quickly to pass on the property tax rebate before this Bill was introduced will be unduly penalised. I think it is very commendable that some property owners had indeed done so and I would like to assure everyone that these property owners will not be penalised for their earlier efforts. If these property owners had already passed on the rebate to each of their tenants in the form of monetary payment, rental reductions or an offset against current and future rental, consistent with the requirements in this Bill, the amount of rebate passed on earlier will satisfy the obligation imposed under this Bill.The second issue, the amount and the timeliness of property tax rebate passed on to the property owner's tenant. The property owners will be required to pass on the benefits they received at two milestones, namely by July 2020 and December 2020. This is because property owners on instalment payment plans for their property tax will only receive the full benefit of the rebate by the end of the year. These two milestones therefore strike a balance between ensuring that property owners will not be required to pass on more than the rebate that they have received on hand and ensuring that they pass on the rebate in a timely manner to their tenants.Third, whether master tenants are required to pass on the property tax rebate to their sub-tenants. While we are cognisant that sub-tenants, namely the tenants of the property owners' tenants, are also impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, the obligation under this Bill is on the property owner to only pass on the rebate to his own tenants. It does not extend to requiring the property owner to pass the rebate to the sub-tenants or to require that the property owner ensures his own tenant passes the rebate to the latter's sub-tenant. There are two reasons for this.First, we are very mindful that there is a whole range of commercial arrangements between tenants and sub-tenants. It is not always a straightforward landlord and tenant relationship. They have profit-sharing, they have partnership arrangements. So these can be quite complex.Second, there is no contractual between the property owner and the sub-tenant. So it would be rather onerous to oblige the property owner to reach out all the way to the sub-tenants.Nevertheless, we strongly urge and encourage all master tenants to pass on the savings from the rebate to their sub-tenants and to share the burden during this time of uncertainty and difficulty.Fourth, on the maximum fine of $5,000 and whether or not that is sufficient as a deterrent against non-compliant property owners. Again, let me provide some context. First, the fine of $5,000 takes reference from the Property Tax Act, which sets a penalty for general offences at a fine of the same amount. Second, remember that property tax is paid on a per account basis. So, a retail mall, for example, would have multiple property tax accounts to pay and if they were to not comply with multiple property tax accounts, then the fine of $5,000 will be compounded up to $5,000 per account.I should remind everyone that the fine does not absolve a property owner of his obligation to pass on the property tax rebate to his tenants under the Bill. The property owner must still pass on the rebate fully in the prescribed manner and by the prescribed timelines. Tenants can bring civil action against a property owner to enforce the obligation to pass down the property tax rebate.On documentation required of property owners, property owners should ensure that they keep sufficient documentation to show clearly when the rebate was passed on and how much was passed on to their tenants. In the case where the property owner lets out a property to multiple tenants, then the owner should also keep documentation showing how he derived the amount of rebate to be passed on to each of his tenants. Property owners can retain the relevant documentation in either soft copy or hard copy form so long as they remain available over a period of three years.We also strongly encourage property owners to ensure that their tenants acknowledge the property tax rebate received. This is to minimise potential disputes between the owner and the tenants on whether the rebate has been properly passed on.Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe I have addressed all the comments from Members and I thank them for their support.Mr Deputy Speaker: Minister for Law.7.06 pmMr K Shanmugam: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the Members who spoke. I tried to note down as many of the questions as I could. If I have missed out on any of them, it is not intentional.Mr Zainal Sapari and Mr Patrick Tay asked if we could extend the protection that this Bill offers, to cleaning firms, security firms and others. The general point I want to make is that this COVID-19 Bill is not intended to be a general intervention to all contracts. At the same time, Members would have noted it gives me the power to add further categories of obligations and contracts beyond the five that are specified.Both Mr Zainal and Mr Tay are Labour Movement Members of Parliament. I suggest that NTUC study these two contracts that they have specifically talked about, whether they think that a case can be made out – that COVID-19 has particularly affected these contracts and some relief ought to be given, because performance has been affected by COVID-19 in an unexpected way and it is unfair to expect performance. If they can make a persuasive case, we will be prepared to add those categories, but always bearing in mind that this is not simply a case of – there is some problem and therefore we need to help people in their contracts. It has got to go beyond that and be a matter of principle. There should be unfairness in enforcing the contracts and we must find a fair way in resolving the issues.Subject to that, my Second Reading opening speech made it very clear that we have a duty to help the people who have been affected by COVID-19. We should not ask people, we should not require people to be held very strictly to the contracts if they have been affected by this massive event. So, we will take a sympathetic approach.Mr Murali Pillai asked about trading contracts. I think I can give the same answer, and the Member can take it up with us. But I want to tell him this. I think we need to be careful about trading contracts. There are many wide varieties of trading contracts. Some of them are international in nature and we ought to be careful about imposing our legal obligations on international parties, because that can also have a disproportionate impact on Singapore as a commercial hub. So, we need to be careful about that.If we are talking about trading contracts within Singapore, Mr Murali Pillai is a lawyer. If it is a question of say, delivery of certain supply, and that supply is no longer available or supply has been affected by logistics, the contracts usually provide for relief in themselves. The law also provides for relief. But if Mr Murali Pillai believes that over and above that, we can identify a class of contracts that can be circumscribed and be subject to relief, we will be happy to consider them.There was a question about hire-purchase agreements. If the item is for business, as I said in my speech, that will be protected.Mr Murali Pillai also asked about international arbitrations or arbitrations which are not local, and can there be a moratorium? We carefully considered this. We have been promoting Singapore as a cross-jurisdictional, international arbitration centre. Two parties who are unconnected to Singapore often come to Singapore to arbitrate and I really do not think it is our business then to be saying automatically that there should be a moratorium.If a French man and a Chinese party have dealings with each other, and they have chosen Singapore because of its neutrality, and the law that applies is, let us say, a foreign law. Simply because they have chosen to come to Singapore, we should not impact on their arbitration. We should leave it to them to decide. If they have chosen Singapore law, then COVID-19 will become part of Singapore law if Parliament passes it. So, we thought about this quite carefully.Mr Christopher de Souza asked, what about actions taken before this legislation comes into force? For example, deposits which may have been forfeited. Now, the Bill covers deposits which may have been forfeited. So, as I said earlier, that has got to unwound. Other than that, if other actions have been taken, if properties have been possessed, it is difficult for us to go back and unwind retroactively. But pending legal actions must be stayed if the categories of contracts are covered by the Bill.Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about the scope of contracts that are covered. He asked about wedding couples who want to cancel their bookings. It covers hotel bookings, it covers all goods and services relating to the event, and for those who have already cancelled, if the deposit has been forfeited, as I explained earlier, relief is available. And I have explained what sort of relief is possible.I have also pointed out the need to balance between recovering the deposit immediately and the ability of the other party to pay, because everyone is suffering from COVID-19. It does not mean that the event planner or the other contractual party who has taken the deposit can immediately pay back the deposit to everybody who is demanding immediate payment. So, there needs to be some justice, which is why we have gone via the route of Assessors to look at individual facts and decide.Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about remedies. I spoke about it in my earlier speech. One possibility, which I think is the fairest, is that as a rule, if you have booked an event or a certain venue, if now you cannot hold it because of COVID-19, the fairest is to postpone, if that is possible. And then, the event or the event planner or the hotel does not lose out. They still have the contract. You do not lose out because your deposit is not lost. Both sides find a reasonable accommodation. If that is, for one reason or another, not possible or not suitable, if the contract has to be cancelled, then the question is how much to refund and what is a fair amount to be given back, and those are matters for the Assessors.And I made the point earlier. Just because you do not want to proceed with the event does not mean that you must get back 100%. If the event companies have spent some money, if they have done some work and so on, they need to be compensated for that.Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about whether contracts for tours with travel agencies and air tickets will be covered. The contract for tours with travel agencies will be covered. There should be no forfeiture of deposits. Tours can be postponed. Otherwise, alternate arrangements can be directed by the Assessors. Contracts for air tickets are not covered. Airlines have their own re-booking, refund and cancellation policies that are broadly similar internationally, and we should not intervene in those. Many airlines are currently sorting out those issues with their passengers as well as travel agents.Mr Saktiandi asked about events that are slated for the later part of the year and whether the Bill could offer protection for such contracts. The answer is – his guess is as good as mine. It depends on how long this situation lasts and how long the Bill is valid for; in the first place, as I have said, it will last for six months. We will see. I am unable to say beyond that.Mr Liang Eng Hwa expressed concern that the reliefs would trigger counter-claims because service providers could charge an upfront fee or price a risk of non-forfeiture in the fees charged. The Bill does not cover contracts entered into on or after 25 March 2020. So, these points would not apply to this Bill. Because the parties are contracting with full knowledge – willing buyer, willing seller.Mr Murali Pillai asked whether relief under the Bill could apply on a mutual basis, for example, if a hotel was unable to proceed with the event because its workers are on Stay-at-Home Notice, and he asked why big companies ought to be covered.Sir, the principle is one of fairness, justice and equity. On the whole, the Bill helps the weaker party. But that does not mean always that the bigger party is at fault. For example, if the hotel is unable to proceed because of COVID-19, is that the hotel's fault, and should we try and find some other alternate arrangement?The relief under clause 5 of the Bill would apply to either contracting party which is unable to fulfill obligations and revise them in a way that seeks to be fair to both parties. For any party to obtain relief, whether big or small, it would have to show that it was unable to perform the obligation and comply, meet the other requirements in the legislation. If the hotel's workers are subject to Stay-at-Home Notices and it can show that it has got no other resources and cannot get any other workers, and if it complies with and fulfills the other conditions in the Bill, it will be covered.Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Chong Kee Hiong all spoke about landlords, especially the smaller landlords who may require rent proceeds to service other obligations, such as mortgage payments. Mr Saktiandi also spoke about landlords who are REITs, and Mr Chong Kee Hiong as well, and the eventual impact that non-payment of rent would have on retail investors.Sir, on REITs and landlords, I have spoken in extenso earlier. The Bill does not alter the payment obligations of the tenants to the landlords. The landlords can show the Assessors that the tenant, in fact, has the financial capacity to pay a part, if not all, of the rent. If the Assessor finds that the tenant is able to pay all or part of the rent, he may determine that the tenant pays that part or in full either immediately or after the expiry of a prescribed period.Now, how do we balance the interests of the landlords and the tenants? Mr Chong Kee Hiong pointed out that the rate of return will be affected. I spoke at some length about rates of return. I think, at this point, the real question is not the rates of return but how do we protect the parties. Even if we do not have this Bill, the rates of return are going to be impacted. How many tenants are going to be able to pay? How many tenants are not going to be able to pay? And when a tenant is not able to pay, you put him into bankruptcy, you put him into liquidation, are there a queue of tenants waiting to come in? Is it not going to affect the bottom line anyway?So, those are the realities of the current situation and the landlords are being helped in a significant number of ways. As I have said earlier, they are going to get 75% of their employee wagecost paid for in April. They are going to get Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) paid for their employees following that. They are going to get the whole series of other benefits.MAS has also worked with the financial institutions to provide for credit flow. Other issues that they may have in terms of people not paying rent and having a knock-on effect on their credit position, these are issues that I am sure MAS will be able to talk to them about and then talk to the banks about. We cannot prevent banks from exercising their rights, but I think, overall in Singapore, everyone can take a sensible approach.Essentially, the relief is provided for tenants who are not going to be able to pay anyway. So, all these consequences that one sets out – oh, you know, this is going to impact on the rate of return, it is going to impact on the cash flow of the landlords and so on – but we are dealing with tenants who are not going to pay you, who are not able to pay you.Second, you already have security deposits for a few months. So, your cash flow would not be affected for a few months. And I have indicated the Assessors will be given guidance that, in the first place, in general, they will say for three months, the tenant can suspend payment, if the tenant seeks. Not all tenants will seek. If the tenant seeks that permission, they will be given that for three months and then the Assessor can look at it. The Assessor can give a longer period or shorter period but the general guidance will be three months.The entire system is under threat. It is not business as usual. Mr Chong Kee Hiong also made a good point about – and others, too – you know, supposing they get a six-month rental holiday, even if we set off two, three months, there will be some months of rental accrued and, at the end of that period, it will be a substantial amount. Can they pay up?Well, Mr Louis Ng had a suggestion for that. He asked why do we not be like the Germans? Give an additional two years for them to pay. I do not think the landlords would want that. At the same time, would it mean because some will not be able to pay, therefore, we should not even give them relief now? That would effectively be an argument to say we should not intervene; we should let whoever is going to go bust, go bust, and that would inflict a lot of damage.The proposal we have, there is no perfect solution simply because the situation is very economically dire. There is pain. There is no complete solution. It is a question of how do you share out that pain? If we have a perfect solution where everyone can walk away with their contractual rights, of course, we would do that. But that is not the real world.So, do we say some tenants will not be able to pay at the end of six months and, therefore, we should do nothing now? And, therefore, let a lot of other businesses which can pay go bust? What will the REITs and the landlords be left with in such a situation eventually?So, I would say to the bigger players, look, you are getting the benefits from the Government packages. Play your part and help share some of the pain, too. It cannot simply be that you get all the benefits on one side and, on the other side, you only look at it in terms of your contractual rights.This Bill is one part of, as I have said, the three aspects, the packages put up by the Deputy Prime Minister, the initiatives by MAS. But I understand the points that Mr Chong makes and some of the others make, and I know that some of it is with a genuine concern for tenants. So, really, we are on the same side seeing how we can help the tenants. And is that best done by extending the payment period by two years and giving them a longer period to pay? I want to be careful about it. At this stage, we are focusing on immediate cash flow relief by suspending for a period of six months, or rather, the Bill is for six months; relief is for a period of months, as determined by the Assessor.Mr Louis Ng had a couple of points which would have meant substantive intervention or substantive alteration of the rights. One is to extend the period for payment. The other is even more radical – why do we not automatically reduce the rental? I want to be very careful about it because, as Mr Chong Kee Hiong and others have pointed out, there are also landlords who are small businesses themselves. They may have one small building with some tenants. And if you tell them that the rent is going to be reduced automatically by a certain percentage, will they survive and is it fair to them? These are all issues that require much more careful deliberation by Ministries, beyond MinLaw. It requires an economic analysis; it requires an assessment of how the situation plays out over the next few months.Meanwhile, if the Bill passes, we apply a tourniquet, we hold the ring, we give people time. It also gives the time for the Government to assess the situation as it proceeds, do a deeper economic analysis to see whether any other interventions are justified. We have got to be very careful talking about these interventions. If we say we are studying intervening in order to reduce the payments that tenants make, then you can be sure a lot of tenants, even those who can pay, will not pay. They will say \"Let us wait for what the Government is coming up with\".If we say we are not going to deal with this, then a lot of landlords, who might have been willing to accommodate a better arrangement with their tenants, will say \"Well, since the Government is not going to come in and do anything, therefore, we do not need to come in and help\". So, I think Ministers standing at this box need to be very careful in answering these questions. Let us focus on this Bill. This is a suspension. You can be sure that the economic agencies are actively looking at the situation and looking to see how best to handle it as we go forward, and they will take into account all the feedback that has been given.Mr de Souza asked whether the Assessor can determine that the security deposit may be used to offset rental arrears. The answer is a clear yes. It does not even need to go to the Assessor. We have already said there is nothing to prevent set-off by the landlord against the security deposit.It is not in every case that the Assessor will have to even decide, review after two to three months. It will depend on the circumstances and, really, if the parties can work it out themselves more sensibly, then it does not even have to go to the Assessor.If the landlord can show that, yes, there is a queue of tenants waiting to come in and it is unfair to the landlord to allow a particular tenant to carry on without paying rental, that is something the Assessors will take into account.Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked a related point whether putting in this Bill will give struggling tenants a false sense of hope that they may not need to pay. I expect that tenants, our commercial people, are quite savvy. I am quite sure they will try and understand what the obligations are. But in any event, MinLaw will put it out in very simple terms as much as possible and push it out. I think even if the tenant is under such a misconception, I am sure the landlord will correct those misconceptions pretty soon.Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked if the landlord will be prohibited from imposing interest on late penalty fees for rent. He also spoke about this with respect to bank loans. These are outside the scope of this Bill but Members will know that the MAS initiatives cover quite some aspects of what he has mentioned.Ms Joan Pereira asked if the Government will be putting in place further mechanisms to monitor the situation of smaller businesses. Mr Liang Eng Hwa also called for economic agencies to help companies cope with their payment obligations. Mr Saktiandi asked whether the inability of businesses to fulfill contractual obligations would count against their credit ratings. These questions all raised broader policy questions beyond the ambit of this Bill. I can tell Members that the economic agencies are monitoring the economy very closely.Ms Jessica Tan spoke about construction contracts, how delay in construction contracts will impact individuals or businesses for whom the works have been committed. Mr Lim Biow Chuan also said that he has residents who cannot shift out of their tenanted residential homes because the contractors are not able to complete renovations due to the circuit breaker.Well, you can look at the Minister for Health. He has imposed the restrictions and there is nothing any of us can do about it. He has actually made it into a criminal offence if you breach those regulations – Part 7 of this Bill. So, we just have to comply. Now, that impacts on everyone.It is outside the scope of this Bill except to the extent that anyone wants to claim liquidated damages against the contractor. So, what happens to all these people who are in temporary arrangements? I think everything has got to extend by a certain period. However long the Minister of Health tells you that you cannot move, you are stuck. And that in turn depends on health assessments which obviously must override all other considerations because if we are not careful there can be a substantial spread.In those situations, the law outside of this Bill provides for certain types of reliefs, Mr Lim knows. If you are not able to perform, if the law requires you to be in a certain situation, there is nothing you can do. You cannot complete on a certain date.And I am given to understand that during this period, 7 April to 4 May 2020, HDB will also not issue any new renovation permits, but HDB will allow on-going renovation works to be completed if it would take only a few days to complete essential works. Basically, if you can do the work within two or three days, and it can be safe for residents to stay, HDB will allow you to do it.For those with no other housing options in this situation, HDB will be prepared to allow a few more days to complete minimal essential works to make the place liveable in the interim. And the rest of the works can be carried out later. For those whose flats are undergoing transactions, sale purchase, the buyer and seller will have to discuss new dates. That is essentially it.There have been some questions on Assessors. Mr Saktiandi, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr de Souza had a number of questions on Assessors.There is no minimum or maximum cap on the value of the claims that may be brought to the Assessors. We will seek to appoint a sufficient number of Assessors to ensure that the process is as quick as possible, as efficient as possible, and my Ministry will also be looking at implementing a quick and simple online process of making an application, sending documents, receiving determinations. Hearings may also be held via video-conference where that is viable.Mr Liang Eng Hwa suggested giving Assessors powers to direct a process to restructure loans. That will be outside the scope and ambit of this Bill. The Assessors do not have that power and the primary purpose here is to suspend obligations for a period.Mr Lim asked what is to be done if there is clear prejudice shown by an Assessor. How would MinLaw ensure that the Assessor would always be impartial? The process will have to comply with the rules of natural justice and judicial review remedies will be available, when there is breach of natural justice or corruption, for example. Mr Douglas Foo asked if Assessors would be covered by indemnity insurance. The Assessors will not be acting in their professional capacity. The Bill provides that they will have no liability with respect to anything done in good faith, so there is protection.Mr Murali asked and sought clarification on the phrase \"unable to perform an obligation\", in relation to event contracts. It is meant to cover the performance of obligations. The intention is to look at whether a party can perform a contract. In the situation that Mr Murali pointed out, the couple have as much obligation to accept the goods and services as an obligation to pay the price for it. If the contract is to have a wedding banquet of a photography services, but they have become unable to accept the services because of the new measures, they are unable to perform.Mr Murali also sought clarification on the phrase \"inability to a material extent caused by a COVID-19 event.\" The Bill is intended to cover situations where COVID-19 has meaningfully caused the inability to perform. It need not be the dominant cause but it cannot be a remote, insignificant cause either. It can cover situations where there is more than one reason for the inability to perform the obligation as long as COVID-19 is a material reason.Mr Murali also sought to clarify whether a contractor who intends to seek relief under clause 6, which prevents the other party from calling on a performance bond, has to serve notice on the other party. The answer is yes. The notification for relief has to be served in order for the contractor to rely on clause 6. If the notification for relief is not served expeditiously, the other party may call on the performance bond. A balance has to be struck between providing relief to the contract and certainty to the beneficiary in the event of default. The paying bank also needs to know whether to honour the payment of the performance bond.Mr Murali recommended that MinLaw look at digitising wills, should the circuit breaker restrictions extend beyond four weeks. As we explained during the Committee of Supply orCOSspeech this year, we are reviewing the probate and administration regime and we will consider his suggestions as part of that review.Mr Saktiandi asked what the Government is doing to ensure that the reliefs given to employers are reaching employees – whether in terms of helping them keep their jobs or upgrading their skills. These are outside the scope of this Bill and they were dealt with by the Deputy Prime Minister yesterday and today.Ms Jessica Tan said that Assessors will review the moratorium after three months. I should correct this: they may review it depending on what the first order is. It does not preclude giving a longer period or shorter period, but the general position would be three months and then review.Mr Louis Ng specifically mentioned the case of a lady who had a car hire-purchase and she uses it for purposes of her work. I suppose personal and work. She is in the property field. I can understand. I think it is a fair point. We gave some thought to it when we considered it and we left it out, when you take a hire-purchase vehicle and it is not used purely for business.We left it out because pretty much everyone who takes or buys a vehicle on hire-purchase may be able to say that they need it for their work. They need it to travel to their workplace or they need it as an essential part of their work. So, that was not the intention of the clause. The clause is, really to say that the vehicle is part of your goods and trade, like a van that is used to ferry people, cars used to ferry people in private hire business. But we will look at what he has said. As I said, it is not a closed category and we can consider whether some refinements are possible in there.Mr Douglas Foo, I think I have covered his point. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think I have covered the points that at least I wanted to cover.Mr Deputy Speaker: So, if Members have any supplementary questions, please return to your seat. It will make it easier for me to spot you. Mr Murali, please.7.38 pmMr Murali Pillai: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the hon Minister for giving a comprehensive response to the issues I raised in my speech. I just wish to clarify that I did not raise in my speech the issue about landlords' dilemma. Neither to my recollection, did I raise the issue about trading contracts in my delivered speech so I will let the record speak for itself.I have a short clarification to ask in relation to the hon Minister's response to the reference to the Arbitration Act in clause 5(3)(b) of the Bill, Minister mentioned that this was looked at very carefully and what he does not want to do is to affect international arbitration. And he mentioned the example of two parties outside Singapore having arbitration in Singapore and I completely understand where he is coming from.The focus of my question, however, is to deal with situations where the subject matter is dealt with in Singapore. You could have, for example, an international party against a Singapore company. That is also considered an international arbitration under the definition under the IAA so I wonder why in those circumstances, perhaps, the reference to arbitration being seated in Singapore could offer some kind of some kind of practical solution to companies who would also want to seek temporary relief under this Bill.Mr K Shanmugam: I thank the hon Member. As to my setting out what he might have said in responding to things that he may not have said, I am entirely happy to accept that he may not have said it and I may have mistakenly ascribed to him what someone else has said. My apologies.On arbitration, I understand the point that Mr Murali makes. I want to be very careful about this. We will study it, but given how much effort we have put into making Singapore an International Arbitration Centre, I want to be very careful about doing anything that potentially affects that perception. We must also look at how many contracts fall in this category that he mentioned – international party and a Singapore party, arbitration in Singapore, coming out of the International Arbitration Act. If it is not that many contracts – my understanding is it may not be that many – then I think we need to analyse it as a balance of benefits and the damage that could be done to our reputation through perception.Question put, and agreed to.Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. – [Mr K Shanmugam].Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed."

        "Content": "Resumption of Debate on Question [3 March 2020],\"That the total sum to be allocated for Head K of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\" – [Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng].Question again proposed.The Chairman: Ms Rahayu Mahzam.Support for the Special Needs CommunityMs Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong): In recent years, there has been greater support for students with special needs in mainstream schools. For one, schools are equipped with allied educators who can provide more specialised support. There are also professional development opportunities for teachers to acquire deeper knowledge and skills in attending to students with different needs.There are some areas which schools could continue to work on, including helping neuro-typical students understand people with different abilities. This could help with normalising differences, reducing occurrences of discrimination or even bullying. There could also be more extensive support in transitioning students through different milestones in their educational journey by creating an ecosystem and support network with teachers, parents, therapists and people in the community.Having well-trained staff that truly believe in the cause, is key to the quality of support for students with different needs. Can MOE provide an update as well as more information on how it intends to equip educators in mainstream schools with the capabilities and strategies to better support students with special needs?Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce (UPLIFT)Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines): Sir, we have good schemes such as the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme and the School Meals Programme to help ease some of the financial burden faced by some of our students.However, I believe that more can be done to ensure that all our children are given a good start in life. In a recent house visit, I saw two boys standing on the kitchen counter-top and another running around and their great grandmother chased him with a cane. The great grandparents in their late 70s are caring for three boys, age eight, nine and 10. The father has left the family and their mother is a Grab driver. She could not afford much time for them. The seniors told me that it has been difficult as the boys get into disciplinary issues in schools and after-school care. How can the UPLIFT programme identify students and families who need help?Can the Minister provide an update on our UPLIFT efforts, including how MOE is strengthening after-school support and counselling support to tackle the challenges faced by disadvantaged students. What are the efforts to reduce long term absenteeism and drop out numbers, and have the statistics improved over the past five years?Update on UPLIFTMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok): Sir, recently, I met a PE teacher from a school that participates in the UPLIFT programme. He shared that there were occasions where his students did not attend regular classes but would make the time to attend his soccer training sessions instead. Ordinarily, such students would have been barred from taking part in CCA, but what was done here was different and, in my view, \"uplifting\".The teacher used the contact time during the training sessions to develop deeper relations with the students and encourage them to improve their class attendance. This changed approach appears to have worked. Quite clearly, though, a lot of effort has to be put in to change the mindset of the students and, on some occasions, their parents too.May I please ask the hon Minister what are the main problems her colleagues face in the task of ensuring these students under the purview of UPLIFT reach their true potential? What strategies have she and her colleagues identified to overcome these problems? How can we motivate these students to stay the course and how can the rest of the society help?UPLIFT ProgrammeMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong): Chairman, there are many ground-up initiatives in the community to support children from underprivileged families. In Jurong, for example, we have stepped up our efforts over the years. Two years ago, we started the Jurong Central Student Assistance Scheme or SAS, that helps students from families that receive financial assistance from the Social Service Office. We provide $40 to $50 vouchers per month for each student when they to join SAS with parental consent.These students are mentored by trained volunteers in the areas of life skills, social skills and leadership skills. If these students are underperforming in their academic studies, we will provide them with free tuition. To-date, 50 students from more than 30 families have benefited from the scheme for the last 20 months. We have managed to get two donors to donate more than $250,000 over five years. We hope to share and scale this scheme.This is why I was excited to hear about the UPLIFT Community Pilots started by MOE. My experience working with the SAS recipients has shown me that it is not enough to provide financial assistance to students from disadvantaged families. We need to dive deep and understand the needs of the students and families, and provide necessary support like mentorship, so as to monitor, guide and to encourage the students to be the best persons they can be.I believe MOE's UPLIFT efforts are also in the same spirit, with the aim of providing support holistically to children and families in need. To do so, it is important for us to strengthen and coordinate our efforts across agencies and community partners for these students.As more than a year has passed since UPLIFT was first announced, I would like to ask MOE for the progress update. Moving forward, how does MOE plan to link up UPLIFT efforts with community initiatives like SAS, so that we can partner the Government to better help those students in need?Partnership with Parents and CommunityMr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade): Mr Chairman, last year, the Ministry announced major structural changes to the education system, including the implementation of Full Subject-based Banding in our Secondary schools by 2024.MOE's efforts are to reduce the overemphasis on academic grades, and help students build confidence and develop a motivation to learn for life. This is a right move. Education is a team effort involving not just the schools, but also parents, teachers, and the community, so that students can develop to their fullest potential.MOE has made many changes in recent years to work more closely with the community.Last year, a set of guidelines for meaningful school-home co-operation was released, so parents and schools can work together to enhance children's development. Interestingly, many of the guidelines encourage more \"hands-off\" parenting. Parents are encouraged to create conducive environments and let their child develop a sense of responsibility, instead of always breaking their fall.I would like to ask the Minister – have schools noticed a difference after the guidelines were released? If not, what else needs to be done and if yes, what positive signs have we seen? Character building, learning to learn, becoming a better person – all these are much more challenging than scoring straight As.To take this forward, MOE should build strong partnerships with parents, industry partners, and the community to develop the values, dispositions and skills that will place our students in good stead for the future.Would the Minister be able to also share details and examples of how we are working closely with our stakeholders to ensure that our students develop the right values, skills and dispositions so that they are future- ready?Building Strong PartnershipsMiss Cheng Li Hui: Sir, when we talk about education, we are not merely referring to the teachers and schools, or even exams and subjects. It consists of an interrelated group of key stakeholders comprising of teachers, schools, parents and the wider community, so that together they strive to allow our students to develop holistically to their fullest potential.I am heartened that MOE has made many good changes in recent years to work more closely with the community and to build stronger partnerships. For example, last year, they built up upgrading opportunities for our ITE graduates. There is also enhanced support for disadvantaged students through community partnerships and after-school support.Looking ahead, how does MOE intend to build strong partnerships with parents, industry partners and the community to develop the values, dispositions and skills that will place our students in good stead for the future?The Chairman: Minister Ong Ye Kung.10.30 amThe Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung): Mr Chairman, Sir, let me start with Ms Denise Phua's question. Ms Phua asked if MOE has a transformation map. Two years ago, we launched something like that. We launched a reform movement of the education system and we called it \"Learn for Life\". But Members are probably not very familiar with it because we did not launch everything we want to do with a big bang, so no big headlines. Instead, we paced out the announcement of each thrust of the movement, adopted multi-year implementation plans, so that schools, parents and students can fully understand the changes and can adapt to these.Today, let me do three things. One, I will give a short update on what we have done so far. Two, I will talk about the new things we are doing – yes, we are doing some new things. Three, I will tie them altogether.Let us start with a progress update. We have rolled out four thrusts to improve the system we have today.The first is nurturing the \"Joy of Learning\". Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Lim Biow Chuan have asked for an update on this.Joy of learning does not mean schools should be just all fun and games. Joy comes from purposeful learning, from a sense of progress and fulfilment by doing something challenging, hard and meaningful. Then, you feel a sense of accomplishment and you get joy from that.A major move is the changes we are making to the PSLE scoring system. We will grade students in wider bands, what we call Achievement Levels, as opposed to differentiating them very finely through today's T-scores. We hope this will change the psychology of students and parents towards PSLE and reduce the over-emphasis on academic results.The new scoring system, its biggest impact, actually, is that it will affect Secondary school postings and parents are naturally anxious. We will help students and parents familiarise themselves with this new system.Sometime later this year, we will release simulated cut-off points under the new PSLE scoring system for selected Secondary schools. This will be based on last year’s Secondary One Posting Exercise and PSLE results. Next year, we will release another set of simulated cut-off points based on this year’s Secondary One Posting Exercise results. So, two sets of simulated cut-off points before the system goes live in 2021. But please remember these are simulations. It is not that these are definite cut-off points. There can be changes from year to year, as choice patterns change. And when the system goes \"live\", cut-off-points can change further. Notwithstanding this, we hope that by giving parents information early, we can better support them in making Secondary school choices for their children.Another major move is the reduction of school-based exams. All Primary schools have removed exams for Primary 1 and 2. This year, 60% of Primary schools would have no Primary 3 and 5 mid-year exams. By next year, it will be 100% based on our implementation schedule.As for Secondary schools, all have removed Secondary 1 mid-year exams. This year, more than 90% will be removing Secondary 3 mid-year exams. By next year, it will be 100% too.Some schools, such as the School of Science and Technology (SST), have removed mid-year exams for Secondary 1 to 3 in one shot. When I visited the school, the students I spoke to were very happy with the change. They said with the time freed up, they can now do interesting hands-on stuff like coding, designing robots, making prototypes and so on.With more freed up time, other schools such as Gan Eng Seng Secondary introduced a programme called the Learning Fortnight. Students take up electives, like Universities. They do projects, learn a new sport, attend enrichment activities, and enjoy them.However, in general – I will be honest – I think the responses have been varied. When I speak with Primary school students, most will say, \"Hooray, fewer exams\", so they are very happy. But many Secondary school students told me they are not happy; they prefer to have mid-year exams. It may surprise you but it is true. They say, \"Now, without the mid-year exams, we have all these continuous mini-assessments throughout the year. That is more stressful!\" So, I told these students that they have gotten used to exams, which is why we have to change.On the other hand, Primary school students, their learning habits have yet to be formed and, therefore, they welcome the change.So, I advised the Secondary students that these exams are really part and parcel of learning, and they are really not high-stakes. The mini-assessment is not going to affect your future – not very likely.So, focus on learning throughout the year, rather than cram your studies and \"mug\" just before exams; that is a less effective learning habit. Along the way, seek your teachers’ help when necessary and schools will do their best to help you progress.As Mr Lim Biow Chuan pointed out, many students and parents have deep-seated mindsets about exams – not easy to change. But we are trying to change the paradigm. So, instead of tests and exams, the desire and joy of learning should be at the centre of school life.Indeed, as the Member has said, the stakes of exams are high actually because of admission into the next level of education – from PSLE to Secondary school, Secondary school to Polytechnic or Junior College (JC).That is why MOE has been very active in reviewing admission systems across levels. We reviewed the Direct School Admission (DSA) system for Secondary school students. We introduced aptitude-based admission systems for our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). We have done that; the Polytechnics went first. Right now, the Universities are doing it with great rigour.The different admission systems are still being refined to reduce the over-emphasis on exam results, and more changes will come in the coming years.Now, the second thrust of \"Learn for Life\" is \"One Secondary Education, Many Subject Bands\".At last year’s Committee of Supply debate, I announced the phasing out of Secondary school streaming by 2024 and replaced it with Full Subject-Based Banding or Full SBB. Mr Charles Chong and Mr Murali Pillai have asked for an update.As Members know, this year, 28 Secondary schools are piloting Full SBB. They are implementing the following two changes.Number one, allowing lower Secondary Normal stream students to take Humanities subjects at a more demanding level. Of all the Secondary 2 students who are offered this option, more than two-thirds took it up, and that is encouraging.The second change is more interesting – which is that schools are re-organising form classes so that they comprise students from different streams. The form classes take some subjects together, such as Art, PE, CCE and Design & Technology. For other subjects, students will split up into different classes based on their subject bands. Of course, we designed all these before COVID-19 but now we have a situation to manage.Some schools have organised the form classes by CCAs, others by their \"House\" systems. Most schools just like Deyi Secondary School, placed students in classes to ensure a good balance of stream, gender, race as well as learning needs.Deyi Secondary held an orientation camp for the Secondary 1 students to get to know one another. The teachers told me that during the camp, they made a point not to look at the background of the students. They did not know what stream the students were from during the camp, so that there would be no pre-conceived notions. They observed the students, identified those with leadership skills and initiative, and after the camp was all over, they appointed them as class leaders. After that, they opened the file and looked at the background of the students. To their great delight, the leaders comprised students from Express, Normal (Academic), and Normal (Technical) streams as well. The character of the students shone through regardless of their streams.Another teacher at Deyi reflected how Full SBB is changing his subconscious mindset. He spotted a student with long hair. He proceeded to stop the student and asked the three standard questions that he would pose in such a situation.First question: \"Boy, what is your name?”. The boy told the teacher his name. Let us say his name is Bono.Second question: “What level are you?” The child said, “Secondary 1, teacher.”Then, he asked the third question: “Which class are you from?” And Bono said, \"1-Determination.\"Then, the teacher got stumped. Because in the past, if you know the class, you know the stream of the child. Now \"1-Determination\" told him nothing. He did not know what stream the child is from.And then he realised all this while, his line of questioning in such a disciplinary situation was to find out the stream of the child. He reflected to himself: why is that relevant? This is not about whether an Express, Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) student has broken a school rule. Bono needs a haircut – that is all.It is possible that some of us may well have this subconscious mindset. But this teacher was really wise, brave and honest to be aware of it, and to acknowledge it.Important social dynamics are changing in these schools. We will learn from the experiences of the pilot schools and roll out Full SBB nationwide by 2024.The third thrust is \"Education as an Uplifting Force\". Inequality is an issue every society has to grapple with and education is the best social leveller.We are doing a lot more to tackle inequality through education, including investing significantly in pre-school education, setting up more student care centres, enhancing bursary schemes, implementing targeted programmes that bring social partners and community partners together. Second Minister Indranee will speak more about this later.With a good foundation, almost all our students today progress to post-Secondary institutions today. Seventy percent – the large majority – goes to Polytechnics or Autonomous Universities.Mr Ang Wei Neng was worried about affordability of course fees for the lower income group. That is why at the National Day Rally last year, the Prime Minister announced a significant increase in tertiary education bursary quanta for lower income groups. So, for a student from the lowest income group, he pays $150 in annual course fees in Polytechnic, and $2,000 in annual course fees for a general degree in the Autonomous Universities. If that is still too much, he can take up a tuition loan.When they graduate, 90% of them who want to join the labour force find work within six months; that is our track record. Starting salaries have also been going up.By the time they step into the workforce, they would have more or less pressed a reset button that mitigated their childhood disadvantages. This is uplift in action, where all young Singaporeans can access opportunities, because we have a stable country, a growing economy and a good education system.The fourth thrust is \"Learning Languages for Life\".Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about MOE’s bilingualism effort. I thank Mr Lim for sharing his personal experience in two languages. I will answer the Member in one. The Member lamented that he only realised the importance of Mother Tongue Language (MTL) in adulthood, after he stepped into his professional life.Unfortunately, some things do not change, and I think many of our students will still feel the same way as Mr Lim when they grow up.Hence, it is critical to start as young as possible and make students interested in learning MTL.10.45 amThis requires schools and families to complement each other's efforts. Families can provide an immersive MTL environment at home. Then, schools carry on the work, starting with kindergartens putting stronger emphasis on the teaching of MTLs in pre-schools, which we have started to do.We have also introduced targeted programmes. In Primary schools, we introduced a Mother Tongue Support Programme for Primary 3 and 4 students who have a weak command of MTL. Last year, 60 pilot schools enlisted 1,100 students. It will be fully rolled out to all schools in 2021.For students who are strong in MTL, we introduced the Language Elective Programme (LEP) in 15 Secondary schools this year. The Programme supports students to attain a higher level of MTL proficiency and acquire a better understanding of their culture. About 250 students took it up, which is an encouraging start.It also helps to have specialised schools, like the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools and programmes like the Elective Programme in Malay Language for Secondary Schools (EMAS) and the National Elective Tamil Language Programme (NETP).In other words, let us not shy away from doing what it takes to preserve the use of MTLs. The world is moving towards bilingualism, even multilingualism. We have an advantage because of our ethnic diversity and bilingual abilities. We must not only preserve this advantage, but strengthen it further.Let me move to the next part of my speech today – the new things MOE plans to do. They have to do with curriculum – what we teach and how we teach.We need to refresh our curriculum to evolve with the needs and realities of the times. But any changes to curriculum must be very carefully considered. It shapes the values, attitudes, mindsets and competencies of an entire generation. It gives meaning to MOE's mission of \"moulding the future of the nation\".For example, we introduced Values-in-Action (VIA) in 2012 to foster social responsibility amongst young Singaporeans. Today, you can see its imprint in our young Singaporeans, in the way they look at social issues. I do think it has an imprint.As Dr Intan and Mr Ang Wei Neng pointed out, events like the COVID-19 outbreak also offer a valuable opportunity in education. Schools today are placing strong emphasis on personal hygiene and on social responsibility. If we keep all these practices up, even after the crisis has blown over, I think we will have a generation of Singaporeans who will be much more resilient to infectious diseases.Today we face new challenges and realities that necessitate a refreshing of our curriculum. They are in three areas: first, in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE); second, Knowing Asia; third, Digital Literacy.I will start with CCE. I thank Dr Intan, Mr Zainal Sapari, Mr Ang Wei Neng, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Yee Chia Hsing for asking about this. There are a few components to our CCE today, such as the teaching of values, National Education, Social and Emotional Learning, and Education and Career Guidance.In 2016, we started a comprehensive review of the CCE curriculum. The more we progressed in the review, the more we thought it in urgent need of change. Why is that so?Because the young today are different from previous generations in one major aspect, which is their exposure to technology. For those who follow comics and watch superhero movies, they are like Bruce Wayne, who is also Batman – one day, one night. They have one real world that parents can see and another one online, which they spend a lot of time on, that parents do not see. As adults who have grown up without this duality and without this space, I do not think we fully understand what our young are going through.The impact of technology on students and on children is complex and multi-faceted. But let me just highlight one of the most significant effects, which is that technology presents children with the influences, choices and decisions previous generations never had to contend with.In an online world, you can be anonymous and there are no policemen, no editors, no verifiers. A child can choose to be nasty and then get away with it. Whereas in the real world, it is not easy to say something nasty to your friend in the face; a punch can come back. In fact, sometimes there is nothing very social about social media.More importantly now, with a powerful device in their hands, our children can decide: do I use it to acquire knowledge for learning, or access undesirable materials? Do I use it to keep in touch with family and friends, or get addicted to digital entertainment? Do I use it to record beautiful memories, take pictures with my friends or intrude into the privacy of others, or worse, commit a sexual offence?How do we ensure that our young make the right choices and survive well in an online world? I think digital world problems require analogue world solutions. It goes back to our values, our morals, our humanity. Values are what distinguish us from computers and machines, and that we cannot abdicate to technology. We apply our moral and values system whether we are offline or we are online. We determine the purpose of technology, we determine the purpose of devices.Dr Intan said that values are more often caught than taught. I think both are needed. Families play a big part in instilling them in the young, at home. But schools can then work with parents and make a big difference too. We need to update the CCE curriculum to reflect this imperative and reinforce the teaching of values in our children from as young an age as possible. So, we will build on the existing CCE curriculum and strengthen it with the following five changes.Number one, we will restructure formal CCE lessons to reinforce the teaching of moral values. Today, CCE lessons cover both character and values, and also citizenship. For Primary 1 to 3, we will henceforth devote the bulk of CCE lessons to character and values. As the Chinese saying goes, \"品德在先，学术在后\" – values before academics. We will emphasise respect and care for others, honesty, humility and kindness. They must also learn resilience and courage. Our children need to learn to stand up against discrimination, against bullying – of all kinds and regardless of who the victim is.Many of these lessons will be taught in MTL from Primary 1 to 6. We will therefore better align the CCE and MTL lessons – ensure that the standard of the language is appropriate and engage students in much more interesting ways. From Primary 4 to 6, we will broaden the existing Form Teacher Guidance Period to include National Education and citizenship topics – values relevant to us as a nation. For these topics, it is more meaningful to have a diverse group of students from all communities and therefore, these classes will continue to be taught in English.The second change, we will place more emphasis on cyber wellness. We will devote more time and develop more materials to teach this subject, so that students will learn to critically evaluate what they read online, be able to tell genuine news from falsehoods and not rely on social media \"likes\" for validation. They need to be able to say no to bad influences, and protect themselves from cyber bullies and predators.Several Secondary schools – in fact, 11 – have piloted the new CCE curriculum on cyber wellness. I visited one of them – New Town Secondary – and observed a class on the topic of cyber bullying. This was conducted via a video case study and students were asked at every juncture of the story to vote and decide how the story would unfold. So, they could tell how their decisions affected the outcome of the story. I could tell the situation resonated with them and the students were very engaged.To me, the lesson that day was quite clear. The lesson is: if you encounter cyber bullying, seek help and support, do not retaliate. That day, the students voted for retaliation, even though I was sitting there! And the ending did not turn out well. This is one way we are using more authentic scenarios, immersive modalities and giving students more voice and agency to bring CCE to life – not just for cyber wellness, but for all aspects of CCE.The third change, the CCE curriculum will have greater focus on mental wellness, which is closely related to cyber wellness. We already teach students socio-emotional competencies today. The new CCE curriculum will seek to strengthen one important aspect, which is peer support. Second Minister Indranee will speak more on this topic.Fourth, we will expand our efforts to engage secondary school students more actively on contemporary issues through CCE lessons.This is already done today. We will explore more topics, find ways to engage students more deeply and increase the frequency of these lessons to at least once a fortnight.Climate change, as Miss Cheng Li Hui and Mr Yee Chia Hsing suggested, could be one of these issues. Other examples could be Government policies, social inequality, race and religion, online falsehoods and so on and so forth.Mr Leon Perera suggested including a subject like Theory of Knowledge (TOK) into our school curriculum. MOE is quite reluctant to over-crowd our curriculum. It is already quite a heavy curriculum, especially given that TOK is a pre-university subject for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.Some of these contemporary issues and the discussion of them will help hone the critical thinking skills of our students. They may be sensitive to discuss, but they are important to help our students better understand the complexities of our country and our life. MOE will develop the resources and methodologies. Teachers will guide students to listen attentively, converse respectfully and be open to differing perspectives.Finally, given the expansion of the CCE curriculum, we will need to have more time to teach it. We will have to, as Miss Cheng Li Hui suggested, further integrate CCE into school lessons and activities, such as CCAs, camps, learning journeys and Values-in-Action.With these changes, every school experience can be a CCE lesson. Every teacher can be a CCE teacher. And every school a good school, of course. It should become a whole-school approach. This is happening in some schools, but we will implement it system-wide, be more deliberate about CCE and make learning intentional rather than incidental.The new CCE curriculum will be progressively implemented from 2021 in all Primary and Secondary schools.The second area of curriculum review is Knowing Asia. Several Members, such as Ms Foo Mee Har, Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Teo Ser Luck, have explained why this is important. Suffice to say that Southeast Asia is one of the fastest growing regions in the world. Together with China, India, Japan and Korea, they all form part of our natural hinterland.Singapore-based enterprises need to be able to venture out to the region. And Singaporeans must be able to play a part in it. To do so, we need to be equipped with the relevant knowledge, language and cultural skills. But, like all skills, it takes many years, even decades of experience, to become a country or a regional expert. What the education system can do, is to get our students started young and expose them to the region. As a start, we will do this in three ways.First, through our Humanities curriculum. It must provide students with a deeper appreciation of the geographies, histories, cultures, languages and economies of our regional countries. We will give the study of Asia its due emphasis in Humanities subjects.For example, in history, students will learn more about the Vietnam War and how developments in Southeast Asia is intertwined with the complexity of the Cold War. In Social Studies, students can learn about the importance of ASEAN centrality.11.00 amSecond, we will leverage overseas trips. Overseas trips have taken a backseat due to COVID-19 but I am sure, in time, the crisis will blow over.The younger ones in schools attend student exchanges, cultural enrichment or embark on service learning projects. The older ones in IHLs typically go for overseas internships and immersion programmes in a foreign education institution. These have been effective in building their cross-cultural skills, resourcefulness and resilience. Students generally enjoy overseas trips, but I think their favourite destinations are still New York and London.We will organise more trips to Asian countries and encourage students to participate in them. Students from the West are flocking here to experience Asia because of the cultural diversity and the exciting economic opportunities. Our students should do so, too. This is our own backyard and, here, we will always have a natural competitive advantage. We will need that mindset shift that Mr Teo Ser Luck talked about.As announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng in the Budget Statement, our aspiration is \"70-70\". I would like to assure Mr Saktiandi Supaat that the target includes our ITE students. This means to have 70% of IHL students undergo an overseas stint and with 70% of that going to ASEAN, China or India. Today, the numbers are about \"50-50\". So, it is not an exclusive experience, as Mr Faisal Manap puts it. But there is room to do more.Third, we can know our region better through the learning of languages. A good start is to learn our Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs) better. Where possible – I keep coming back to learning MTL better – and if the students have the aptitude and interest, we will also encourage the learning of third languages. For most students, this will be at a conversational level and it is not examinable.So, to Mr Chen Show Mao’s suggestion – I know the Member has been raising this every year – that MOE make the learning of conversational Malay compulsory in Primary school, I think it is better that we continue to emphasise the learning of a student’s own MTL. As it is, many students are already finding that quite challenging. But we have been encouraging students to learn the language of another community at a conversational level. Today, about 60% of Primary schools and 40% of Secondary schools offer Conversational Malay and Chinese. We are encouraging more schools to do so and more schools will do so.There is also value for our young to learn to converse in regional languages, as Members have suggested. We will pair the learning of conversational ASEAN languages with overseas school trips. MOE will start with Vietnamese and Thai. That way, learning is more meaningful and can be immediately applied and more students can access it.The third area of curriculum review is digital literacy. Ms Denise Phua, Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar, Miss Cheng Li Hui and Mr Ang Wei Neng spoke about this. We all know how digital literacy is important for our young. I do not have to explain this.But what are the responses? One popular response around the world is \"Let us make coding compulsory in schools!\" But that is too simplistic. Not everyone will grow up to be a coder. Many of us just need to learn how to use technology and software and be comfortable with using them. Further, programming languages will become outdated by the time the students graduate.Another popular response is, \"Let us give every student a digital device\". It is not a bad idea, but it can do more harm than good if the device becomes another gadget that is a big distraction for the student. So, if we want to do this, we must do it in the right sequence – make sure that the curriculum is rightly designed, teachers are equipped with the suitable pedagogical skills, then use the device to enhance teaching and learning.We need to think about digital literacy more deeply and holistically, rather than simply implementing immediate things that come to mind. One way is to think of digital literacy like language literacy. There are important similarities between the two.First, both are generative or seminal skills, allowing a learner, after you have learnt it, to access knowledge in other domains.Second, both require an immersive learning environment. We do not teach children language just through the formal lessons, but within a holistic and immersive environment. Likewise, we should embed digital literacy within our overall school curriculum and not as a standalone subject.Third, we can break digital literacy into productive and receptive components – listen and speak, read and write. In Chinese – 听，说，读，写。 We are conscious of how we teach each of these components, how they relate to each other and how they reinforce each other.We, too, can break digital literacy down into different components. The framework MOE has adopted is: find, think, apply and create. They represent the different and mutually-reinforcing aspects of digital literacy.Recognising the importance of digital literacy, MOE will launch a National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP). This is MOE’s contribution to the national effort, with a focus on schools and IHLs. Let me explain what the NDLP entails using the four components I have just mentioned.The first component is “Find”. It means being able to gather and use information and data from digital resources. Our young have no problem doing that; they are digital natives. Their challenge is how to do it in a constructive, safe, responsible and ethical way. This will be taught through the cyber wellness component of the new CCE curriculum that I spoke about earlier.The second component is “Think”. This is the ability to manage, analyse, interpret and understand data and then solve problems systematically. These are skills largely found in what we call computational thinking. But we do not need a new subject called computational thinking. The elements are present in existing subjects, especially Mathematics, where there is a strong focus on problem solving already. What schools can do is to explicitly draw out the learning points from Mathematics.Let us take an example – the teaching of prime numbers. I hope Members remember what prime numbers are. A prime number is one that is not divisible by any other number. Today, teachers typically explain the process to identify prime numbers as follows: for a set of numbers, say one to 100, cross out one, then the teacher will say, \"Then, all the higher multiples of 2, cancel off; then all the higher multiples of 3, cancel off; we skip 4 because it is divisible by 2; and then we go to 5, you skip 6 and go 7 and, finally, what you are left with are prime numbers.\" All of us went through that, right?In future, to be more explicit about developing computational thinking, teachers can challenge students to write a simple program to follow that same logical sequence. Through such an exercise, students learn various programming structures, such as loops and conditions. One common programming logic is: \"if, then, else\". So, applied to this example, if a number is a multiple of 2, then you take it out, it is not a prime number, or else you retain it as a possible prime number and you loop back and you try with 3 and then 5, 7 and so on. With this, the already renowned Singapore Mathematics curriculum has received another upgrade!The third and biggest component is \"Apply\". We need to teach students to use software and devices productively to learn to work for daily living across different contexts. A major initiative in this area is the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS). This is a dynamic online learning portal. Almost the whole of our curriculum is on SLS, complete with animation, interactives, videos, assessments and other resources.To Mr Chen Show Mao's question, we started building it a few years ago, way before there was COVID-19. The idea is not to make students learn completely online and not have to go to school. The quality and outcomes of e-learning will never be the same as a physical learning environment with teachers, friends, CCAs and a social setting. Neither are we using SLS to make the classroom high-tech and futuristic.What we want to do is to use SLS to enhance the classroom experience. Let the technology fade into the background, and let the interaction, thinking and discussion come to the fore. Flip the classroom, give students more voice, make learning become collaborative. Then students are more likely to internalise the lessons and achieve better education outcomes.So, we got eight schools to start a pilot project where teachers conducted lessons using SLS and gave every student a personal learning device to access the SLS portal and we learned many things from this pilot project.First, teachers cannot teach the traditional way. They need new pedagogies – e-pedagogy. I witnessed some of these lessons. They are nothing like the lessons that I went through as a kid.At Orchid Park Secondary, I saw how a Mathematics teacher, Mr Marwin Low, used SLS to teach students about angles within a diagram. So, after the students logged on to SLS, they were shown a quadrilateral on screen. The students could drag each of the corners and change the shape and size of the quadrilateral. But no matter how they manipulated the diagram, a display at the side will show that the addition of all the interior angles was always 360 degrees. The concept is presented visually and it is very clear.They were then presented with various tasks, which they had to solve and use SLS to key in their answers. Students can remain anonymous and give themselves nicknames. They could also see each other's answers, comment on them or pose questions. In this online space, anonymity is put to good use as the students experience a much higher level of psychological safety in learning, as Prof Lim Sun Sun puts it.The teacher could monitor the answer given by every student in real-time, through a heat map. If the heat map is filled with green dots, it means everyone got the answer right and the lesson carries on. If it is all red dots, it means everyone has got it wrong, and the teacher had better re-teach the concept. If it is mostly green with some red dots, it means that some students need coaching and the teacher will know who they are and can intervene accordingly.At last year’s Malay Language Anugerah Arif Budiman Teachers’ Award, one of the winners was Cikgu Siti Mariam from Crest Secondary. I asked her how she managed to make her MTL lesson interesting and engaging. She said she used digital technology. In her case, she incorporated her students' interest in photography into the lesson. The students would take photos using their mobile devices, prepare a photo story in Malay and then upload it on an online platform and share it with the rest of their classmates.There are many ground-up digital lesson plans that teachers have created and uploaded onto the SLS platform to share with their colleagues. So, we are now crowd-sourcing digital lesson plans. And I think we are still just scratching the surface of this very powerful SLS tool.A second important insight from this pilot is that to conduct e-learning, it is very useful for every student to have a personal learning device. Device sharing makes learning sub-optimal. A device is as essential for e-learning in a digital learning classroom, just as paper and pen are for a traditional classroom.A third lesson is that having issued a device to every student, there has to be controlled access so that the device is used for education and learning and not other distractions. The pilot schools have effectively addressed this through device usage control. It can access educationally meaningful sites on the Internet, but online games and Korean dramas are out. It will also monitor students’ use of the device and where they have gone to. Some students are naturally disappointed with the limited functionality of their devices, but it is a necessary thing to do. It is consistent with a common school practice where mobile phone usage is disallowed during school hours.11.15 amWe are now ready to expand the pilot programme. Over the next few years, MOE will progressively roll out this new way of teaching nation-wide, to all Secondary schools.By 2024, we will equip every school with e-pedagogy capabilities and every single Secondary 1 student with a personal learning device. This could be a tablet, a laptop or a chromebook. By 2028, all Secondary school students will be equipped with a digital device and this will address the concerns of Ms Denise Phua and Dr Intan.We will make sure that the device is affordable. Given that it is primarily used for learning and education, we do not intend for it to be a high-end device. We will use a bulk tender to lower the price further, probably, I think, to a few hundred dollars.Students can pay for the device through their Edusave accounts. The Government contributes to it annually. Last year, we raised the Government's annual contribution to the Edusave accounts. We also provided a $150 Bicentennial Bonus top-up for all Primary and Secondary Singaporean students.This year, and in anticipation of the full roll-out of this initiative, we will provide another $200 top-up to the Edusave accounts of all Singaporean students in Primary and Secondary schools. This willcost $75 million.We expect most students to have enough balance in their Edusave accounts to pay for the device. Some who have used more of their Edusave funds might have to fork out a bit of cash. But MOE will provide further subsidies for students from lower income household groups and ensure that their out-of-pocketcost is $0.The last component of the digital literacy framework is \"Create\". It is the productive mode, that is, the ability to code a programme, develop an app, create a website, design a game and collaborate with others in the process.Many Secondary schools are leveraging Applied Learning Programmes to get students to develop software or programme robots.We will also expand the number of schools offering \"O\" Level computing, from 22 to 30 schools; and \"A\" Level computing from eight Junior Colleges (JCs) to 10 JCs.To Ms Denise Phua's question, MOE has also partnered the Special Education (SPED) schools to customise digital literacy to the learning needs of their students. For example, Pathlight School offers \"O\" Level computing. For home-schoolers, they can refer to materials that MOE has made available to the public.Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about the efforts at IHLs in pushing digital literacy. IHLs are setting baseline digital competency requirements for all their students. For example, at SMU, students take a module on Introductory Statistics. At Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP), computational thinking is a compulsory Year 1 foundational module.The IHLs are also upgrading their curriculum for sectors that require more advanced digital skills, such as cybersecurity, finance, manufacturing and logistics.In the last three years, the Autonomous Universities (AUs) have trained about 1,000 ICT graduates annually. But the AUs know that the industry is hungry for more talent and have been working very hard to expand the capacity of ICT courses. Today, they are taking in a total of 2,800 ICT students a year, almost three times more than before. And we will find ways to ramp up the capacity further if need be.I have spoken about many changes in the education system. Let me now tie them all together.The most important common success factor for all the changes we are making is our teachers. I think we have the best teaching force in the world to make our education reforms a success.Over the years, we have been able to recruit very good teachers. Many are attracted to the noble mission of education, in helping to mould the future of our nation.Having recruited teachers, we then need to continue to invest in their professional competencies, a point alluded to by Mr Murali Pillai and Miss Cheng Li Hui.So, MOE surveyed our teachers and asked them, given the changing education landscape, what kind of skills do you need most? So, they provided their inputs and the following are the six competencies that teachers told us they needed.One, assessment literacy. As we reduce exam load, teachers want to be able to use other assessment tools, such as project work, quizzes and class presentations.Two, inquiry-based learning. They want to be able to design and conduct a class that encourages active learning, giving students more time to explore, pose questions and find answers.Three, differentiated instruction, so that in more diverse classrooms, teachers can teach in a way that caters to the different strengths and learning needs of the students.Four, support for students with special educational needs. About 80% of our students with special educational needs (SEN) are in our mainstream schools today. Teachers want to have a better understanding of their needs and support them better.Five, e-pedagogy, so that they can use digital technology effectively to enhance learning and especially with the NDLP.Finally, CCE, number six, so that every school experience can be a CCE lesson and every teacher a CCE teacher.Some may ask: how will older teachers keep up with all these new demands in education? I think it is a misperception that older teachers, and for that matter, older workers, cannot keep up with changes.Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat was a guest-of-honour at the Distinguished Chinese Language Teacher Awards Ceremony last year. The most experienced award recipient was Mdm Lee Pick Siew. She has taught Chinese for 24 years at St Joseph's Institution (SJI).Senior Minister of State Chee spoke to her about education technology. It turns out Mdm Lee is a firm believer in using technology to teach languages. She told Senior Minister of State Chee that technology will not replace teachers, but teachers who know how to use technology will replace those who do not know how to use technology. And that is coming from the most senior teacher that evening.Others are concerned that with professional development, teachers will have one more thing to worry about, on top of their teaching and administrative duties.But professional development is not new. Teachers have been doing it for many years.Our teachers were very forthcoming with their input because they want to learn, be good at what they are doing and grow in their careers. They do not see professional development and teaching duties as a zero-sum game.But to make sure that the training is useful, it is important that teachers decide for themselves what kind of training they need. This is the essence of professional autonomy – teachers taking ownership of the tools of their craft. It is essential in determining the standards of practice, developing mastery, deepening capabilities and instilling professional pride. If you cannot do that, you are like a chef who just reheats the food that somebody else cooked.The concept of professional ownership applies to all industries, trades and crafts and, in fact, this is a core philosophy of SkillsFuture.So, in MOE, when we were thinking how do we name this significant initiative to upgrade the skills of our teaches, we came up with the name \"SkillsFuture for Educators\".Mr Chairman, Sir, let me conclude and summarise the key thrusts of our reform efforts. With your permission, Sir, may I request that the Clerks distribute a handout to Members, please?The Chairman: Yes, please. [A handout was distributed to hon Members.]Mr Ong Ye Kung: As you can tell, it is a MOE designed handout. It is what Second Minister Indranee calls, the \"Tree for Life\".At the very base, the ground, it represents our mission which is UPLIFT, making sure that every child has opportunities. No child is left behind because of their family backgrounds. Second, the roots represent the cornerstone of our education system which is bilingualism and learning languages for life. Then, the stem and the branches represent significant structural changes that we are making – the first structural change is to nurture the joy of learning, by making changes to the PSLE scoring system, reducing examination load. The second structural change is to phase out streaming and replace it with Full SBB. And then, the leaves and the fruits represent what we are populating the classroom with, which is refreshing our curriculum to prepare our students to be future-ready – in CCE, Knowing Asia and Digital Literacy. The sun represents what is critical for the system to work well – our teachers. And through SkillsFuture for Educators, we are upgrading their skills and professionalism.Together, these six thrusts form the \"Learn for Life\" movement for schools. It will guide our efforts to raise the school education system to a new level, in the next five to 10 years.I hope this is the transformation map Ms Denise Phua is asking for. I hope it lives up to her expectation. I hope it is as thoughtful as it is bold.The constant improvement of our public systems, like education, is a core aspect of our governance approach and our social compact. Technology and globalisation – yes, they bring about great opportunities, but they can also aggravate inequality and stifle social mobility. To tackle these challenges, we should not penalise the schools or the individuals who have done well, for which parent does not want their child to do well and to be the best they can be?That is why our approach is \"not to cap the top, but lift the bottom\", extend more help to students who need assistance most, devote resources and implement programmes that lift the quality, standards and experience across the board.When I visited Orchid Park Secondary, one of our pilot schools to implement the use of personal learning devices, I met a Chemistry teacher. His name is Mr Ramesh. He said something that left a very deep impression. He said that the most profound implication of the initiative is not the technology or the new pedagogy. It is that now, every student is similarly equipped in terms of computer resources and learning resources.And then, with the SLS, he readily hears the voice of every child in class. The teacher can now more easily detect and zoom in to the students who have somehow fallen behind. In other words, this initiative has further levelled the playing field for all students. And that is the most significant outcome of this programme.And that is also the objective of MOE's other initiatives rolled out over the years, whether it is Applied Learning Programme, Values-In-Action, Outdoor Adventure Learning, Language Elective Programme or the Junior Sports Academy. We are always improving the common experiences of our students.In many countries, social stratification worsened partly because the national system deteriorated. So, the affluent opt out of the national system and they pay for market-based solutions. Over time, this further entrenched the gap between the rich and the poor, who live in worlds far apart – stratification worsens.In Singapore, we counter this trend by ensuring that whether it is in healthcare, transport, public housing or education, we deliver a national system of high quality, even world-class quality.And that is why the education system must always be a work in progress, always be honest in identifying our strengths as well as our gaps and areas for improvement, keep engaging and working with stakeholders to improve it, and doing all these while keeping school fees to a few dollars a month for the great majority of our schools. We will make sure no one is denied a good education because of their family background.Within these commons, we enable social mobility, we help children from poor families break out of poverty, we build a platform for all Singaporeans to mingle and build bonds. We can fulfil the aspirations and dreams of successive generations.From Learn for Life to SkillsFuture, we will inculcate the spirit of lifelong learning in our young and ensure that they will be ready for the future. [Applause.]The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah): Mr Chairman, the Government is committed to nurturing every Singaporean to their fullest potential. Minister Ong has just shown you our roadmap through the \"Tree for Life\". But even as we transform the education system to help Singaporeans seize opportunities of the future, we will ensure that education remains an uplifting force that provides opportunities for all, regardless of their background or the challenges they face.11.30 amOne key challenge our youths face today is mental well-being. Many colleagues have asked how we can better support our students’ well-being. Prof Lim Sun Sun spoke about the importance of building positive learning environments; Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Assoc Prof Daniel Goh suggested strengthening mental health education in schools, to equip our students to handle life’s challenges; while Ms Anthea Ong asked if we can increase the number of counsellors and introduce mental health screenings.Thank you all for your thoughtful speeches and questions. Student well-being is of utmost importance to MOE. Our efforts in this area are guided by three broad questions. First, at the most basic level, how can we create a positive learning environment in our schools? Second, how can we equip our students with the knowledge and skills they need to overcome challenges and setbacks? And finally, how can we support the small group of students with more serious mental health challenges?So, let me address each of these in turn.First, creating a positive school learning environment for all students. Our teachers and school leaders play a crucial role in this. In our Singapore Teaching Practice (STP) model, creating a \"positive classroom culture\" is a fundamental teaching process. The STP is covered in pre-service training at NIE, as well as in-service courses by the Academy of Singapore Teachers.In CCE, positive teacher-student relationships are strongly emphasised. We will also be developing our teachers’ competencies in establishing strong teacher-student relationships, and providing a caring and enabling environment, through the CCE practice area of SkillsFuture for Educators.As Prof Lim Sun Sun acknowledged, the vast majority of our teachers undertake their roles with professionalism and care. There are times where teachers have to be more strict with students. This is a part of their duty. However, in cases of unprofessional conduct, where the teachers step over the bounds, such as deliberate attacks on students’ self-esteem, schools will take a serious view, and intervene as necessary to safeguard our students’ well-being, and maintain a positive learning environment.Having laid the foundation of a positive school learning environment, the next step is to build resilience, by equipping our students with the skills and knowledge to overcome setbacks.To help students face challenges confidently, we will help students develop the resilience mindset of \"I am, I have, I can\". \"I am\" is about helping students to appreciate their strengths and harness positive beliefs about themselves. \"I have\" is about enabling students to tap into their social and emotional resources, like peer and family support. And, \"I can\" emphasises skills that will enable students to cope and thrive, including emotion regulation, problem-solving and managing relationships and conflicts.\"I have\", which is about tapping on support, including peer support, can be really powerful in schools. Research has shown that having a sense of affiliation among peers, positive vibes and feeling supported by one another, all contribute to positive well-being. Some of our schools have already introduced peer support structures, to good effect. To illustrate, let me share an example from Bukit Merah Secondary School. We have changed the students’ names to protect their privacy.Last year, Steve from Bukit Merah Secondary started training to be a Peer Support Leader. He buddied up with his classmate Mark, who was frequently absent due to his gaming addiction. Steve encouraged Mark to come to school, and started eating with him during recess and breaks. Steve's friends also joined in, and got to know Mark as well. Whenever he could, Steve met with Mark after school to help him with work that he had missed. Gradually, Mark started coming to school more regularly and more punctually. When we asked Mark what helped him to make the change, he said he felt really encouraged when he asked Steve if anyone missed him when he was absent, and Steve replied simply, \"Have lah, have lah\".The smallest, simplest gestures can make a difference. Anyone can do it. That is what makes peer support so powerful. Therefore, we will establish peer support structures in every school by 2022 and continue to strengthen the peer support culture in our schools. Our vision is for every student to be a peer supporter, forming a strong network of support in their class, CCA or peer group, where they can look out for each other and seek guidance from teachers or counsellors where necessary. The Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have also put in place peer support programmes similar to those in schools.In addition to this, we will include mental health education in the CCE curriculum for Secondary schools,\tto\thelp\tstudents\tto understand common mental health issues and their symptoms, know when and how to seek help for themselves and others, and develop empathy and care towards persons with mental health issues. Similarly, the Polytechnics and ITEs have worked with the Health Promotion Board to develop mental health resources for their students.The new mental health education in schools will complement our earlier efforts to help our students develop a resilience mindset and to foster peer support cultures. Together, we will equip our students with the knowledge, skills and support networks to better overcome challenges.But even so, there will be a small number of students who struggle with mental health issues. For these students, additional support by professionals is needed.We need to identify these students in order to support them. Teachers in schools and class advisors in IHLs are trained to pick up signs of distress, reach out to students facing difficulties, and refer them to a counsellor if necessary. With stronger mental health education and peer support cultures, students will also be able to look out for one another and seek guidance from teachers and counsellors if they notice that a friend is struggling.Students who require additional support will be referred to the counselling professionals in schools, including counsellors and para-counsellors. Students assessed by counsellors to have more serious mental health issues will then be referred to external professionals for further clinical assessment and intervention. External professionals include the hospitals’ REACH teams – that is Response, Early Intervention and Assessment in Community mental Health – and IMH's Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT).To Ms Anthea Ong’s suggestion to increase the number of counsellors, MOE will continue to work with our institutions to review this regularly. For example, those with higher needs will be able to hire additional counsellors and are given the funding and the manpower provisions to do so.But counsellors are just one part of the wider eco-system of support for mental well-being in our schools and IHLs. This eco-system, comprising peer support networks, teachers, counsellors, external professionals, provides a robust and responsive approach to ensuring timely identification and targeted intervention for students with mental health needs.While there are merits of universal mental health screening, mass screening can also raise complex issues, such as over-medicalising of behaviours in young persons or negative labeling effects. We also need to evaluate the age appropriateness and effectiveness in the school context.To illustrate how our system of support works, let me share another student’s story with you – we will call him Sam. A few years ago, Sam was suffering from panic attacks. He could not submit his work on time. His teacher referred him to the school counsellor. The counsellor learnt that Sam’s parents were going through a divorce and that was what was causing Sam to struggle with severe anxiety. The school counsellor taught him coping strategies and worked with mental health professionals to address his anxiety condition. However, Sam still found the situation overwhelming and stopped coming to school.But the school did not give up. They continued working with a Social Service Agency (SSA) to reach out and support Sam and his family. Sam’s classmates and CCA-mates also encouraged him to return to school, offering a listening ear and help in homework. Over time, Sam started to attend school again and re-joined his CCA. Today, Sam is doing much better. In fact, he has become a peer supporter himself and is using his experience to help others who are going through similar difficulties. So, you can see from there it is a whole eco-system.Support for youth mental well-being is a whole-of-society effort. Outside of MOE, a lot of work is being done by other Government agencies, SSAs, community groups, private organisations and individuals. I agree with Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, our youths themselves should be at the centre of these efforts. Earlier this year, MSF, MOH and MOE, in collaboration with MCCY and the National Youth Council (NYC), issued an open call to anyone interested in improving youth mental well-being. Last week, Minster Desmond announced that we will set up a new Youth Mental Well-Being Network, bringing together more than 700 people who responded to the open call, many of whom are passionate youths. Minister Desmond will share more about the network during MSF’sCOS.To ensure our education system provides opportunities for all, MOE is also committed to supporting students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) to reach their fullest potential.Over the years, we have increased the variety of high quality educational settings. Today, around 80% of students with SEN learn in mainstream schools, supported by teachers and allied educators with specialised skills. Our Special Education (SPED) schools, which provide customised learning environments, dedicated resources and specialised manpower, support the remaining 20% of students with higher needs. MOE’s funding for SPED schools has increased by about 40% in the last five years.Ms Denise Phua and Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked about MOE’s plans to support students with SEN. We can, and will do more. For students in SPED schools, we are continually improving affordability and accessibility of education. Since January this year, six SPED schools have lowered their fees by at least 25% for Singapore citizens. We are also working with SSAs to open three new SPED schools. One will support students with moderate-to-severe SEN who have both Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disability, while the other two will support students with moderate SEN who have ASD and can access the National Curriculum.Finally, we note Ms Denise Phua's suggestion to extend the exit age for SPED schools. While the exit age remains at 18, students offering an academic or vocational national certification may remain in SPED schools until age 21. This will allow them additional time to become work-ready. Of the 422 SPED students aged 18 years old in 2019, 150 remain in their schools this year, when they turn 19. Most will progress to open employment before the age of 21.For students with SEN in mainstream schools, I am happy to announce two new initiatives. First, MOE has developed a professional development roadmap to enhance SEN training for all educators in mainstream schools. Second, we will provide more financial assistance to students with SEN in IHLs. I believe Ms Phua talked about that.SEN training for educators. Minister announced earlier that MOE will embark on SkillsFuture for Educators or SFEd.\tSupport for students with SEN is one of the focus areas of SFEd. We have thus developed a new SEN Professional Development Roadmap (PD Roadmap), to better equip our educators in mainstream schools to support students with SEN.We want every teacher in mainstream schools to become more skilled in supporting students with SEN. MOE will work with NIE to strengthen the inclusion of SEN support strategies in pre-service teacher training. For in-service teachers, MOE will launch bite-sized online learning resources in phases from this year. The SEN PD roadmap will also provide more professional development (PD) opportunities for educators who play a more specialised role in SEN support – namely, our Allied Educators in Learning and Behavioural Support, teachers trained in Special Needs or (TSNs) as well as the school management team. MOE will share more details in the coming months.11.45 amSecond, MOE will extend the SEN Fund to cater to a wider spectrum of learning needs beyond those with sensory or physical impairments.The SEN Fund was established in 2014 to help Polytechnic and ITE students with physical or sensory impairment to purchase education-related assistive technology (AT) devices and support services. Feedback on the SEN Fund has been positive. It has helped students to keep up with academic learning and improve day-to-day interaction with peers. Thus far, about $675,000 has been disbursed under the SEN Fund, benefiting more than 120 students.In my engagements with students with SEN at the Polytechnics and ITE, they told me it would be helpful to extend the SEN Fund beyond physical disabilities, and they are right, as is Ms Denise Phua. Advancement in assistive technology devices have made it easier for students with other types of challenges to access education and prepare for independent work and life.MOE will thus extend the SEN Fund to Polytechnic and ITE students with language and learning difficulties, as well as social and behavioural difficulties, including conditions like dyslexia, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These students will be able to tap on the SEN Fund to purchase assistive technology devices, up to a cap of $5,000, from 1 April 2020. Eligible students can approach their SEN Support Office to apply.I am also happy to say that the Autonomous Universities will be extending the same support to their students with SEN for the purchase of assistive technology devices.Besides funding, the SEN Support Offices in our IHLs also provide support to students with SEN from pre-enrolment to graduation.Before enrolling in an IHL, prospective students can approach the SEN Support Offices in IHLs to find out more about courses that better suit their interests and learning needs. After enrolment, the SEN Support Offices work with the lecturers and tutors to make arrangements to ensure that students with SEN can access the curriculum and assessment tasks.For students with SEN who require additional support to transition to the workplace as an intern, the IHLs also work with SG Enable and SSAs to identify suitable internship opportunities, prepare the students and ensure that they get the support that they need during internship.MOE will continue to work with schools and IHLs to strengthen support for students with SEN to ensure that they, like all other students, receive the support they need to maximise their potential.MOE is also committed to ensuring that financial circumstances are never a barrier to education for Singaporean students.Students with financial difficulties can tap on a variety of MOE support schemes. In 2019, 52,000 students from lower income families at the Primary to pre-University levels benefited from the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), SPED Financial Assistance and the Independent School Bursary. Another 72,000 students from low- to middle income families in our IHLs benefited from the government bursaries in academic year 2018.Last year, we announced changes to make preschool and higher education more affordable. To ensure that education remains affordable at every stage, MOE will enhance financial support for two more groups – students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme at Primary, Secondary and pre-University levels as well as full-time NITEC and Higher NITEC students in ITE. The Deputy Prime Minister announced this in the Budget Statement and I will provide more details today. With your permission, Mr Chairman, may I ask the Clerk to distribute a handout to Members please?The Chairman: Yes, please. [A handout was distributed to hon Members.]Ms Indranee Rajah: First, we will enhance the MOE FAS, which supports Singaporean students at the Primary, Secondary and pre-University levels. Recognising increased transportcosts, from April 2020, we will raise the public transport subsidy from $10 to $15 per month, for Primary up to pre-University levels. For Primary school students who take the school bus, we will also enhance the school bus transport subsidy to 60% of monthly payable fees, up from 50% today. This means that for parents paying a school bus fare of $110, out-of-pocket fees will drop to $45, which is down from $55 today.Next, we will enhance the school meal subsidies for Secondary school students from April 2020 to $2.90 per school meal, up from $2.50 today. The meal subsidy for Primary school students will remain at $2 per meal.Finally, to strengthen support for pre-University students, the pre-University bursary will be increased from $900 to $1,000 per year.These FAS enhancements will be similarly applied to students in the lowest income tier of the MOE Independent School Bursary. MOE will also extend applicable aspects of the FAS enhancements to SPED schools.Similar to last year, we expect around 52,000 students from the Primary to pre-University levels to benefit from the enhancements. This willcost around $52 million each year, a 20% increase from today.Second, MOE will increase support for full-time NITEC and Higher NITEC students in ITE, which Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Zainal Sapari asked about.Today, MOE subsidises over 90% of the totalcost of NITEC and Higher NITEC courses. Lower and middle income students can receive further assistance through a cash bursary. MOE will enhance the cash bursary by between $50 and $200.Beyond this, from April 2020, students from low-income families will also benefit from a full fee subsidy, in addition to an enhanced cash bursary of $1,500. This is for NITEC and Higher NITEC students from families with gross household income of $2,750 and below, or per capita income of $690 and below. We expect around 19,000 students to benefit from the enhanced ITE bursaries.Students within the top 10% of GCE \"N\" or \"O\" Level entrants in each Higher NITEC and NITEC course receive the Community Development Council/Citizens' Consultative Committee-ITE Scholarship. These scholars currently receive a cash award of $1,600 a year. From April 2020, the scholarship will be enhanced to also cover their fees fully. Around 1,400 NITEC students and 1,200 Higher NITEC students will benefit from this. We will also rename the scholarship to ITE Community Scholarship to better reflect its purpose. It is also easier to remember.With these enhancements, we will spend around $28 million a year on bursaries and scholarship for full-time NITEC and Higher NITEC students, an increase of around 20% from today.To ensure that students can easily access financial support schemes, we agree with Mr Lim Biow Chuan that the application process should be simple, without causing any embarrassment. In MOE schools, teachers and staff keep a lookout for students who may require financial assistance. When approaching students, they take care to do so sensitively and discreetly. MOE also partners with Self-Help Groups to support students and families who need additional assistance beyond MOE. In our IHLs, information on financial aid and application processes is readily available online or can be obtained at the institution's financial aid office.The process is even simpler for families on ComCare assistance. Students in our schools, Polytechnics and ITE, whose families are on ComCare assistance will be automatically granted MOE financial assistance without the need for any more documentation.Despite our best efforts, we recognise that there are still some students who struggle in our education system. Each of these students has a unique set of challenging circumstances. We believe that these can be overcome with the right support and that is why we set up UPLIFT – the Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce. Mr Murali Pillai, Ms Cheng Li Hui, Mr Charles Chong and Dr Lim Wee Kiak have asked about UPLIFT's work. Let me provide an update.A key focus area of UPLIFT is strengthening after-school care and support for students. This is done through school-based student care centres (SCCs) in Primary schools and after-school programmes in Secondary schools.After-school support is especially important for students who do not have conducive home environments to return to after school. Providing these students with a structured and supervised after-school environment gives them the opportunity to develop good habits, routines and skills that will help them to succeed later in life.Last year, I said MOE would expand our current provisions for after-school support, so I am very happy to announce that we have achieved our target of opening an SCC in all 185 Primary schools this year, up from 170 last year. Since we started expanding school-based SCCs in 2012, we have increased the enrolment from 3,000 to about 27,000 this year. We monitor demand for our SCCs closely and will work with the service providers to expand their capacity, but without compromising programme and service quality.With more places in SCCs, we are now stepping up efforts to identify, enroll and provide support to students who would most benefit from SCCs. Over the past year, MOE worked closely with the community and MSF to study ground feedback, and walked the journey with these students and their families. We identified the main challenges that these families faced in enrolling their child in a SCC, and together, we developed solutions to address them.One major challenge is affordability. Today, children from low-income families attending MSF-registered SCCs receive fee subsidies under the ComCare Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA) scheme. However, some students on MOE's FAS still pay more than $120 per month after SCFA subsidies. Making SCCs more affordable for low-income families is an important step towards getting these students into the SCCs and into the right environment for them to do well. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim will share more about this in his speech for MSF later this week.Beyond affordability, families face other challenges. For example, some may require their children to head home after school to look after their younger siblings or grandparents. Others may need help with the documentation needed to apply for financial assistance. Such complex challenges can only be surfaced and addressed through deeper, more personal, engagement with these families.Recognising this, we have developed a more comprehensive, proactive approach to reach out to families and tackle challenges together with them.First, schools will proactively identify students who would benefit most from the SCC environment and then go the extra mile to engage and build trust with their families, encouraging them to enroll their child in the SCC.Second, we will engage the community to help address each family's challenges in a holistic and targeted way. Some families are referred to the Social Service Offices or Family Service Centres to help with childcare for their younger children, so that older ones can attend school and SCC, instead of having to look after their younger siblings.Finally, we will make the enrolment process and application process for SCFA more user-friendly. For example, teachers will walk families through the various documents that they have to submit and guide them through the process, if needed. For families with complex circumstances, schools will exercise judgement and be more facilitative in the enrolment of children into the SCC.12.00 pmWe piloted this outreach approach in a few Primary schools in July last year, because we wanted to see whether it would make a difference. I was struck by the passion I saw in our teachers, who went out of their way to engage families, understand their challenges and work with the community to address them. They visited the students’ homes – multiple times in some cases. They conducted tours of the SCC for the students and induction sessions for parents, because we want to get the parents on-board to make sure the parents send their children to the SCCs. And I am most heartened to announce that we successfully enrolled 87 of the 100 students that we identified for the pilot.After these students were enrolled, schools brought in community partners to engage them through targeted programmes to strengthen motivational support, resilience and holistic development. And, within the short span of six months, we have already begun to see progress in our students.In Boon Lay Garden Primary School, our pilot outreach efforts helped four siblings – let us call them Nadia, Adam, Sofia and Danial – to enrol in their school’s SCC. The four siblings received limited support at home, as their mother was busy taking care of three other younger siblings. I think we are all familiar with cases like this. Adam and Danial, in particular, had longstanding difficulties with completing homework on time.Since joining the school’s structured SCC environment, Adam and Danial have improved their time management skills and now manage their homework more confidently. As the SCC at Boon Lay Garden is run by Big Heart Student Care, a joint venture by the four Self-Help Groups (SHGs), the brothers also enjoyed plug-in programmes run by the SHGs, like the \"Backyard Science Workshops\" run by MENDAKI. The oldest sister, Nadia, also benefited from the SCC staff’s reinforcement of positive values and habits taught by the school. In recognition of her improvement, Nadia was awarded the school’s \"Good Progress Award\" last year.With Nadia, Adam, Sofia and Danial progressing well in the SCC, their mother no longer needs to worry about them completing their homework when they return home.Given the positive outcomes such as these, MOE will be implementing this enhanced outreach approach in all Primary schools. This will enable us to support more students from different backgrounds and further strengthen social mobility.Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about UPLIFT’s progress in partnering with community initiatives and how such initiatives could link up with UPLIFT. Since the Taskforce was set up, UPLIFT has been supporting collaboration between schools and the community. I am very encouraged by the number of people who have come up to me to say, \"I want to be part of UPLIFT, how can I help?\" It is not just individuals; community organisations and companies have come forward too, approaching the schools directly, or working through the UPLIFT Programme Office.One such company is Singapore Press Holdings’ Chinese Media Group or CMG. Last year, CMG worked with New Town Primary school and Qihua Primary School to start a Chinese reading programme called \"Reading with You\".Leveraging their student publication, \"Thumbs Up Junior\", CMG staff including journalists and radio deejays engaged the students in enrichment activities and conversations, with the support of volunteers from the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC) and Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Apart from immersing students in a Chinese Language-rich environment and improving their fluency and confidence in the language, the journalists also shared about current affairs and their experiences, serving as positive role models for the students.The students enjoy these interactions with their big brothers and sisters. Over time, we hope such programmes can help students hone\ttheir strengths in their Mother Tongue Languages. As relationships deepen, the volunteers can also play a role in shaping the students’ aspirations. Such mentorship opportunities can be valuable for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, as the mentors inspire them and broaden their worldview in a natural, informal setting.Another key focus area of UPLIFT is tackling long-term absenteeism. Early upstream intervention is critical to prevent occasional non-attendance from becoming long-term absenteeism.Earlier, I spoke about upcoming enhancements to SCC provisions for Primary school students. At the Secondary school level, we have set up after-school programmes in over 70 schools under GEAR-UP, benefiting more than 3,000 students. These programmes focus on befriending and mentoring by trusted adults, peer support and interest-based activities to engage the students. We are on track to scale up GEAR-UP to 120 Secondary schools this year.School-based support in SCCs and GEAR-UP can be complemented by community-based programmes like academic coaching, drop-in services and parenting support. However, schools may not always know about these programmes. Likewise, community organisations may not always know which students and families need help.To close this coordination gap, UPLIFT has worked closely with MSF to pilot a solution. I am happy to update Members that since January, we have embarked on the UPLIFT Community Pilot, appointing an UPLIFT Town-Level Coordinator in the Social Service Office of three towns – Woodlands, Kreta Ayer and Boon Lay.The Town-Level Coordinator will help integrate school-based and community-based support. Where students have emerging attendance issues and needs that can be met by community-based programmes, schools will refer them to the coordinator. The coordinator will identify the needs of the students and their families, source for suitable resources and programmes offered by the local community partners, and then connect them to the students and families. By improving coordination, we can set up protective factors around the students and their families faster, and address underlying causes of absenteeism earlier.The UPLIFT Community Pilot will pool together the collective wisdom and resources of schools and the community, to better support vulnerable families. We estimate that more than 300 students could benefit from this pilot.Sir, in conclusion, to ensure that education remains an uplifting force for all, regardless of starting point, we will need the collective contribution and conviction of every Singaporean. I hope that what I have shared today will inspire more individuals and organisations to step forward and\tpartner with us. Together, we can ensure that every Singaporean is cared for and supported to become the best that they can be. This is how we will build a society of opportunities for all. [Applause.]The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat.The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chee Hong Tat): Mr Chairman, we started the SkillsFuture movement five years ago. The vision was to provide opportunities for all Singaporeans to develop skills mastery in different areas and fulfil our fullest potential regardless of our starting points in life.This is what SkillsFuture is about – an inclusive and empowering national movement to enable all Singaporeans to chart our learning journeys. It starts from our schools, where we lay the foundation and passion for learning, followed by continuing education when students graduate and join the workforce. Constantly learning, re-learning and even un-learning. This continues after we retire, as part of active ageing.Like the inspiring story that Mr Murali Pillai shared, learning is a never-ending endeavour. And as Ms Denise Phua has rightly pointed out, lifelong learning is a key focus for MOE.SkillsFuture provides the foundations to grow our economy, transform our enterprises, upskill our workers and create good jobs for Singaporeans. It also enriches our lives as we learn new skills and discover new experiences. It is an essential pillar for building a society which is both pro-enterprise and pro-worker, and\twhere\tmultiple\tpathways\tlead\tto\tmultiple peaks\tof excellence.We had three goals for the initial phase of SkillsFuture: to engender a shift in societal culture towards lifelong learning; to provide greater support for individuals to initiate and take ownership of their learning; to strengthen Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) as the third pillar of our CET ecosystem, complementing employers and private training providers.We have made good progress so far. About 500,000 individuals and 14,000 enterprises have benefited from SkillsFuture initiatives. Many were able to perform their work better after training, and earned higher salaries.I agree with Mr Gan Thiam Poh on the need for quality control and risk management. We will continue to\tensure\tthe\tquality\tof\tour\teducation\tand\ttraining ecosystem, to support courses with clear employability outcomes, and raise the quality bar for training providers.Since last year, SSG has enhanced its capabilities to deal with fraud and abuse. It set up a dedicated Division to focus on this area, and introduced data analytics and machine learning to detect suspicious claims, as well as more traditional methods, such as surprise checks and mystery shoppers.SSG will come down hard against errant training providers and individuals. Make no mistake – there will be zero tolerance for fraud and abuse. We will also review the legislation to further strengthen our regulatory and enforcement powers.Sir, while\twe\ttackle\tthe\timmediate\tchallenges\tposed\tby COVID-19, we must remain focused on preparing Singapore for the future, and\tcontinue\tour\tpush\tfor\tlifelong\tlearning\tand\tskills mastery.Two years ago, Minister Ong assessed that we were about a quarter of the way there. Recently, he said we have achieved close to 50%. An improvement, but this is still only the halfway mark. Advancing on the second half of our journey is what we want to achieve under the Next Bound of SkillsFuture.We will continue to focus on training that equip our workers with job relevant skills that enhance their employability. In\tparticular,\twe\twant\temployers\tand\tenterprises, especially SMEs, to play a bigger role in supporting lifelong learning and to upgrade the skills of their workers.At the same time, we will enhance support for individuals to initiate our own learning. This is important for Singaporeans who are self-employed and those who want to pursue a different career or learn a new skill beyond their current industry.We\talso\twant\tto\tprovide\tmore\thelp\tfor\tmid-career Singaporeans in their 40s and 50s, to give them greater support to reskill and stay employable, whether is it in their current jobs, or if they switch to another company or industry.The enhancements will be implemented under five areas.First, we will strengthen our collaborations with intermediaries to help enterprises with transformation and skills training. These go hand-in-hand. The better our skills training, the more assurance we can give to our workers and the\tfaster\twe\tcan\ttransform\tour\tenterprises\tand economy.Many\tenterprises,\tespecially\tSMEs,\tdo\tnot\thave\tthe resources to conduct their own in-house training. We understand. This is where partnerships with intermediaries, such as trade associations, anchor enterprises and professional firms, can come in handy.We will work with a group of large anchor enterprises – also known as SkillsFuture Queen Bee companies – to drive enterprise-led training. Ms Foo Mee Har and Dr Intan asked about this. These anchor enterprises are industry leaders with deep sectoral knowledge, resources and extensive business networks.One example is Singapore Power, which is working with SSG and eight SMEs in its supply chain to build workplace learning capabilities. Singapore Power aims to bring in another 40 SMEs by the end of this year, and eventually to include the rest of the sector. By having companies like Singapore Power train beyond their own needs, they can uplift the capabilities of other enterprises and also other workers in the entire sector. Over the next five years, we aim to partner up to 40 anchor\tenterprises\tto\treach\tout\tto\t4,000\tcompanies, especially SMEs.To further support their transformation efforts, SMEs can tap on the $10,000 SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. I spoke about this yesterday at the MTICOS. SMEs can also benefit from many existing grants and subsidies to\timprove\tproductivity,\tredesign\tjobs\tand\ttrain\ttheir workers.Mr Douglas Foo asked about training of emerging and future skills. SSG has worked with the IHLs to curate the SkillsFuture Series courses focusing on such skills. There are 34 Skills Frameworks which employers can use to plan their talent pipeline for emerging and future jobs.We will tap on intermediaries such as TACs, anchor enterprises, IHLs and professional firms to provide guidance to employers on emerging skills. For example, SSG has worked with PwC Singapore and Universities like INSEAD and SMU to launch a number of Masterclasses for SME business leaders. These will benefit around 100 individuals this year.Next, we will intensify efforts to help employers develop stronger workplace training capabilities. The National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning (NACE) was launched at Nanyang Polytechnic in 2018. NACE has engaged over 250 companies for which 100 have started to implement workplace learning programmes.12.15 pmWe will expand NACE to two more IHLs over the next few years. The next one will be at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) later this year. By 2025, we aim to help over 1,200 enterprises build best practices in workplace learning and work-study capabilities.Sir, these efforts will complement our plans to expand the Work-Study pathway.We launched the first slate of SkillsFuture Work-Study Programmes in 2015, with close links to the industry. Students can apply what they learnt in school to their workplaces and bring practical experiences and problem statements from their jobs back to the classrooms. Employers welcome the programme as it helps them to attract more young Singaporeans. It is a win-win arrangement. About 5,500 students have benefited from Work-Study Programmes since their launch in 2015 and about 1,400 companies have participated so far.We will expand the SkillsFuture Work-Study Programmes into a mainstream pathway in the Next Bound of SkillsFuture. We aim to offer this pathway to 12% of each age cohort by 2025, and this translates to about 5,000 intake places, which is an increase from the current 3.5% or 1,600 places.Work-Study\tProgrammes\tare\tuseful\tto\tprepare\tour students for the workforce. But\tapplied\tlearning\tis\tnot\tconfined\tto\tWork-Study Programmes. Internships are another important avenue.Mr Faisal Manap suggested having a national level framework to establish common standards in internships and facilitate matching of students to internships.Sir, such a framework had been put in place since 2015. This was one of the recommendations by the Applied Study in Polytechnics and ITE Review (ASPIRE) Committee chaired by Second Minister Indranee Rajah. IHLs would ensure that their students on internships are provided with structured mentorship from the participating companies, with clear learning outcomes. More than 90% of Polytechnic students undergo structured credit-bearing internships in their final year of diploma studies. And these cover a wide range of industries, including culinary, retail, hospitality, healthcare and early childhood education. So, it was not factually accurate for Mr Faisal Manap to say that internships are mostly for technology and finance sectors. It is broader than that.On the matching of students to internships, a centralised model, as suggested by Mr Faisal Manap, may not produce better outcomes than the current approach. The way companies currently offer internships is through partnerships with our IHLs. The\tIHLs\tknow\ttheir\tstudents\twell\tand\twhat\tindustry opportunities are needed to deepen their learning. So, it is not quite the same as companies filling job vacancies through open recruitment. The two process may appear same-same, but they are different.Let me now touch on how we are empowering individuals to learn for life.The SkillsFuture Credit was introduced in 2015 to bring about an important mindset change, that each of us must take charge of our personal learning journey towards skills mastery. We are empowering individuals.The $500 SkillsFuture Credit has been well-utilised. More than half a million Singaporeans have used their Credit and amongst them, close to 40% have either fully used up their Credit, or are close to doing so. More than 90% of SkillsFuture Credit claims were for work- related and industry-oriented courses. We will provide a top-up of $500 to the SkillsFuture Credit for every Singaporean aged 25 and above this year.Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked if some workers could start using the top-up before 1 October. The\tSkillsFuture\tCredit\ttop-up\tis\tdesigned\tto\tsupport individuals with their lifelong learning needs beyond the COVID-19 crisis. That is why the top-up is valid for five years, till 31 December 2025. The original start date was 1 January 2021, but SSG has done what it could to bring it forward to 1 October 2020, while ensuring that the top-ups are administered accurately and used appropriately. SSG will look at the possibility of allowing appeals on a case- by-case basis, for example, for those who are in-between jobs and need to use their Credit for training to get a new job.For individuals who are currently employed, we encourage their employers to provide them with the training during this period, tapping\ton\tthe\tAbsentee\tPayroll\tand\ttraining\tsubsidies provided by SSG. The employees can then keep their SkillsFuture Credit for use later, within that five-year window.Mr Png Eng Huat spoke about training support for mature freelancers and he made reference to the Surrogate Employer Programme which Mr Patrick Tay mentioned during Budget debate.Sir, all Singaporeans and PRs, regardless of employment status, are eligible to receive course fee subsidies for MOE and SSG-funded training courses. Those who are aged 40 and above can receive further subsidies of up to 90% under the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy. It does not matter if they are employees, self-employed or in between jobs. For employees who are sent for training by their companies, their employers will typically cover the post-subsidy course fees. For others, like freelancers, they would pay the 10% co-payment on their own, and they can use their SkillsFuture Credit for the out-of-pocketcosts.So, contrary to what Mr Png said yesterday, self-employed persons and freelancers aged 40 and above will receive up to 90% in course fee subsidy, no different from an employee. And this includes courses for freelance trainers, which Mr Png mentioned in his cut.Mr Png also made reference to the Surrogate Employer Programme. Mr Patrick Tay had raised this idea in the context of providing a training allowance to self-employed persons while they go for training, to help them during the COVID-19 outbreak.Yesterday, MOM announced the new SEP Training Support Scheme, where all self-employed persons will be provided with a training allowance over the next three months when they attend courses under the SkillsFuture series and selected sector-specific training programmes. This is different from the SkillsFuture course fee subsidy that I explained earlier, which is not linked to the Surrogate Employer Scheme. The 90% course fee subsidy is one thing, the training allowance is another. Let us not mix up the two.Sir, SkillsFuture is for all Singaporeans at every stage of our lives. I agree with Ms Foo Mee Har on the need to support individuals in navigating the courses available. We will provide customised recommendations on training options through MySkillsFuture portal, including quality and outcomes ratings of courses. And we hope this will help individuals to decide which courses will be more relevant or have better quality.For individuals who prefer face-to-face support, we have been working with the libraries, CDCs, e2i and PA, to provide SkillsFuture Advice workshops to help individuals find out about different SkillsFuture initiatives and plan for their training. More than 100,000 individuals have participated in these workshops, and even more will benefit in the years ahead.We are planning to expand the reach and enhance the training guidance under SkillsFuture Advice\tvia the Career Centres, in collaboration with partners like the unions and career advisors, including private sector entities that provide such services on a commercial basis. And this will supplement the assistance for individuals provided through\tthe portal and our existing SkillsFuture Advice workshops.Finally, the Next Bound of SkillsFuture will focus on our mid-career workers in their 40s and 50s. We will help them to refresh and rejuvenate their skill-sets, so that they can remain employable and benefit from new opportunities.Deputy Prime Minister announced a comprehensive set of measures under the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package. The other Ministries – MTI, MCI, MOM – have touched on some of these initiatives yesterday.MOE will work with MOM and MTI to increase capacity and placements for re-skilling programmes. We\twill\tramp\tup\tthe\tcapacity\tfor\tcareer\ttransition programmes at CET centres, to complement other re-skilling programmes such as Professional Conversion, Place-and-Train and Tech Skills Accelerator Mid-Career Advance for ICT jobs.Mr Zainal Sapari asked if these career transition programmes could be more targeted at mid-career workers.Currently, many of the re-skilling programmes are, what we call Place-and-Train, where individuals are first matched with an employer before they start their training. We will add to these by expanding the career transition programmes, as suggested by Dr Lim Wee Kiak. Individuals will be trained before they receive career support services, such as advisory and placement from CET centres. There is less certainty of placement compared to Place-and-Train, but this provides greater flexibility in the eventual choice of job. It also allows us to train more individuals in industry-relevant skills to enhance their employment prospects and offer employers a job-ready candidate at the point of placement. Both types of programmes have their usefulness and their relevance as they serve different groups of Singaporeans. They complement each other.From 2020, these different re-skilling programmes will collectively increase the placements of Singaporeans in their 40s and 50s. Our aim is to double the numbers in five years.We will also provide an additional $500 SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career Support). In other words, a worker aged 40 to 60 this year will receive a total SkillsFuture Credit top-up of $1,000. If he has not used his first $500 from 2015, he will have a total amount of $1,500.In the Next Bound of SkillsFuture, we target to benefit a total of 28,000 companies and one million individuals over the next five years. We will need more resources to support these enhancements.Over the next five years, Government will spend about $1.4 billion on the Next Bound of SkillsFuture. We are investing even more in SkillsFuture compared to the first five years.At the same time, we have to review our existing initiatives, and reallocate our resources across different areas.We will review course subsidy rates, together with the Enhanced Subsidy Schemes. We will continue to subsidise up to 90%, with more support for courses that lead to clearer employment outcomes. This is in line with the calls from several Members.Schemes that have become less relevant over time, such as the SkillsFuture Qualification Awards, will be gradually phased out.We will also be making some adjustments to Absentee Payroll. The larger enterprises are currently benefiting more from this provision. We will review the rates and set a maximum amount each company can receive so that the funding support can be distributed to more companies.We were planning to make these changes together with the enhancements under the Next Bound of SkillsFuture. However, with the COVID-19 situation, we will defer these changes to a later date and focus our efforts for now to help businesses and workers to tide through the current challenges.One recent change that we made was to increase the course fee subsidy to a flat rate of 90% and raise the Absentee Payroll rates to $10 per hour for sectors like tourism and air transport, which are worst-hit by the drop in tourist arrivals. The intent is to help our companies and workers during this difficult period. And as Deputy Prime Minister said, if the situation calls for it, the Government is prepared to do more.Ms Sylvia Lim asked about the appeal process for PSEA. We had discussed the usage of PSEA in this House in November last year.Sir, I thank Ms Lim for acknowledging that course quality and relevance are valid factors in deciding which programmes can qualify for PSEA usage. And Ms Lim is right that PSEA monies are not subsidies per se, but they comprise mainly Government top-ups which come from public funds. We have a responsibility to safeguard the interests of all account holders by upholding the quality and relevance of approved courses, to guide Singaporeans on which courses would produce better outcomes for them.But I understand Ms Lim's point in the case of her resident, due to his unfortunate family situation. I will share her feedback with MOE colleagues to see how we can improve the appeals process for handling exceptional cases. Sir, please allow me to continue in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]SkillsFuture will continue to be a critical enabler for Singapore's next phase of development. It supports skills training and lifelong learning, and it can help enterprises transform and be more competitive.We have made good progress with SkillsFuture in the past five years, and will be taking it into the next bound.One of the key initiatives in the Next Bound of SkillsFuture is to enhance support for individuals to pursue lifelong learning through a SkillsFuture Credit top-up of $500 for every Singaporean aged 25 and above this year. The top-up will be valid for five years.In addition, Singaporean mid-career workers aged 40 to 60 in 2020 will receive an additional SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career Support) of $500 for them to access Career Transition Programmes, as part of the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package. This group of workers will receive a total of $1,000 in SkillsFuture Credit top-ups.We will also be growing the SkillsFuture Work-Study Programmes into a mainstream pathway which will be made available to 12% of each cohort. This will benefit employers and provide more pathways and options for our students.(In English): Mr Chairman, MOE is committed to building a strong foundation for students in schools and also offering a quality education at the IHLs and lifelong learning thereafter. Minister and Second Minister covered the initiatives in schools earlier. Our IHLs have similarly embraced the spirit of recognising aptitudes, skills and experience over qualifications and translated this philosophy into their admission policies, enhancing porosity across the different pathways.Minister and Second Minister covered the initiatives in schools earlier. Our IHLs have, similarly, embraced the spirit of recognising aptitudes, skills and experience over qualifications, and translated this philosophy into their admissions policies, enhancing porosity across the different pathways.First, for \"A\" Level students who do not progress to the AUs, we will help them obtain a Polytechnic Diploma within a shorter time. For a third of the Polytechnic diploma courses, they will be able to graduate with a diploma in two years instead of three years.12.30 pmSecond, we will expand aptitude-based admissions at NUS, NTU and SMU. This enables more students to be considered based on non-academic aptitudes and strengths, and broadens holistic recognition of individuals beyond grades.Third, we will expand pathways for working adults to enrol in full-time diploma courses, including those who have part-time Nitec, Higher Nitec or WSQ diploma qualifications and we will do so by recognising their relevant work experiences and the skills that they have acquired.These changes in higher education reflect the spirit of SkillsFuture to provide multiple pathways, support continuous learning and deepen our focus on skills.They are part of MOE’s effort to build a continuum of education and learning opportunities for every Singaporean, starting from young, through our adult and working life, and after we retire, as part of active ageing.Let us work together to build a nation of lifelong learners with a deep passion for new knowledge and skills; to grow a society that values skills mastery and recognises different peaks of excellence; and to nurture a people who are resilient and resourceful, and who are ready to seize the opportunities that come our way. [Applause.]The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim): Mr Chairman, as I hear about how we are supporting our people to seize the opportunities of the future, I am reminded of the importance of nurturing well-rounded individuals guided by a strong set of values.Indeed, MOE remains committed to this cause. That said, I am also reminded how important it is for all of us – parents, teachers, and the community – to work together to bring out the best in our children. Mr Chairman, allow me to first speak in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Over the last few years, many parents have shared with me that being a parent has brought them tremendous joy – but equally, many sleepless nights. As a father of two children, I can relate to this sentiment.As parents, we want what is best for our children and seek to bring out the best in them. At the same time, we are also responsible for moulding them into responsible individuals with a strong moral compass, a sense of heritage, and as Minister Ong had shared earlier – a strong foundation of values, tools and skills to navigate the world ahead of them.This is also something that MOE is committed to – even as we embark on the shifts in our education system that my colleagues have spoken about. Ms Cheng Li Hui and Mr Seah Kian Peng asked about our partnerships with parents, community, and industry, and how these would help to nurture the right values, dispositions, and skills in our students.First, our schools actively reach out to parents, and work closely with them to support our children in pursuing their strengths and interests, and to impart good values and attitudes. Our Guidelines for School-Home Partnerships, which were released last year, were well received by parents and schools, and we have observed some encouraging signs. For example, the focus of conversations between teachers and parents has shifted from an overemphasis on academic achievement, to students’ learning dispositions, physical and mental well-being, and classroom behaviour.I was very encouraged when Madam Titek Rohani, whose youngest child is now in secondary school, shared how she makes it a point to learn from teachers about her child’s strengths and interests, her child’s relationships with fellow students, and whether her child contributes to his peers’ learning. She also works closely with the school to guide her child as he explores different education pathways.(In English): Mr Chairman, second, schools and parents work closely to role model good values and attitudes for our students. Values are both caught and taught, and likewise both practised and preached. I am very heartened to hear how parents and teachers are collectively encouraging and galvanising students amidst the COVID-19 virus situation. They are indeed role models for our students.Our teachers have seized the opportunity to educate our students about the virus and their part to play. They do this through teaching scientific knowledge; inculcating good hygiene practices; as well as facilitating discussions on empathy, resilience, and a sense of community.Parents too, have volunteered their time and effort to support the school community. For example, Rulang Primary School had sent out a circular to parents to inform them of the extra cleaning measures undertaken to ensure that the premises remained clean. In response, members of the Parent Support Group volunteered to help with cleaning efforts, which reduced the load of frontline support staff. In addition, the parents put together care packages to encourage the staff, cleaners and security officers for their hard work in ensuring that the school premises remained clean and safe.From both our teachers and parents, our students are learning how they too can be part of the solution: by demonstrating kindness and being socially responsible. Together, they demonstrate the resilient, caring spirit of partnership that binds the nation together in trying times.Lastly, community and industry partners have a big role to play in developing our students holistically. Our schools have been actively engaging them to provide a richer learning experience for our students and broaden their horizons. Mr Terence Ho asked what our plans were for developing local arts institutions and suggested introducing local composers and compositions as part of our music curriculum.This is something that we have done. One of MOE's key learning objectives of the Music syllabi is for students to appreciate music across local and global cultures. During music lessons, our students are introduced to traditional and contemporary music and instruments in Singapore through a selection of songs that reflects Singapore's diverse and rich culture.Some schools have gone further and engaged local artistes to contribute to their programmes. For instance, Boon Lay Secondary School works closely with industry practitioners – such as Ms Melissa Quek, who is the Head of the School of Dance and Theatre at the LaSalle College of the Arts – to plan and deliver dance lessons/workshops under the school’s Learning for Life Programme. This partnership has inspired students to appreciate the arts more deeply, and exposed them to different career possibilities.MOE and MCCY will continue to closely study plans to develop our local arts institutions, including Mr Ho's suggestion of an arts university, taking into account the evolving arts education landscape and developments in the industry.Mr Chairman, I would also like to take this chance to reaffirm the Government's commitment to supporting our students. Ms Anthea Ong asked if we would extend subsidies for Primary school students with foreign passports.All students in our Primary schools benefit from education subsidies, with some differentiation in the amount of subsidy to reflect the benefits of citizenship. Likewise, Singaporean students in MOE-funded schools who need financial support are eligible for financial assistance schemes. Nonetheless, non- citizen students with at least one Singaporean or Permanent Resident parent can approach our schools for assistance. We will assess their situations and exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis.Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap asked if we would extend the Financial Assistance Scheme and Edusave Award to full- time madrasah students. He drew a parallel with the provision of Edusave Contributions (EC) to madrasah students.This comparison is mistaken. All Singapore Citizens aged seven to 16, regardless of school, receive an annual EC based on their age. This ensures every Singapore Citizen child receives support for secular enrichment activities.The Edusave Awards, by contrast, is part of the programme in our national schools. They recognise the character, leadership, conduct, learning dispositions, and academic achievements of students enrolled in national schools. Similarly, the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme caters to students in MOE-funded schools. Students in private schools are hence not eligible for the Financial Assistance Scheme or Edusave Awards.That said, the Government recognises the role that the madrasahs play for the community. Hence, students in madrasahs receive support through the Edusave Contributions. They are also eligible for the Madrasah Student Awards administered by MUIS, which recognise madrasah students' educational excellence.In addition, MUIS provides assistance for madrasah students from low-income families through the Progress Fund Madrasah Assistance Scheme (PROMAS). Furthermore, PROMAS recipients who perform well in both their religious and secular subjects and exhibit exemplary character are also eligible for the PROMAS Performance Award.Mr Chairman, in closing, I would like to reiterate that it is only through our collective efforts – with parents, teachers, and the community – that we bring out the best in our children and nurture well-rounded individuals guided by a strong set of values.While we may play different roles, we can all work together, as MOE’s mission statement proclaims, \"to mould the future of our nation\".The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling): Mr Chairman, Sir, a teacher once told me and, I quote, \"Our job is not to prepare students for something. Our job is to help students prepare themselves for anything.\" And I thought this is really true and this captures the essence of what MOE seeks to do as we enable Singaporeans to \"Learn for Life\", as what Minister Ong Ye Kung has shared in his speech earlier.Let me give some quick updates on our continual efforts to empower Singaporeans, young and old, with the skills and dispositions to take on the future with confidence.To put Singaporeans in a good stead for the future, like what Minister Ong said earlier, proficiency in Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) is key, as the age of Asia opens door to greater opportunities. Mr Chairman, Sir, please allow me to say a few words in Mandarin.12.45 pm(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Mr Chairman, the learning of our Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) is only natural given our cultural context, and will also help our students grasp the opportunities of a rising Asia. MOE has collaborated with the three Mother Tongue Language Learning Promotion Committees since their formation some 15 years ago. Since then, we have worked closely with the community to encourage the learning of MTL within and beyond schools – be it Chinese, Tamil, or Malay.Over the last few years, there has been a stronger nexus between the work of the Committees and the formal MTL curriculum, and this has led to a mutually reinforcing relationship between schools and the community. Teachers and students are encouraged to apply lessons from the classroom to their daily lives and creations, to support joyful and authentic MTL learning.For instance, Members may be familiar with the annual National School \"Xinyao\" Festival. Recently, we introduced a new “Creative” songwriting category where students submit original compositions based on the MTL curriculum taught in secondary school. This was not easy. Instead of just singing a song that is composed by others, students would have to draw inspiration from the textbook and compose a new song. Last year, I attended the finals which lasted for about three hours. It was fascinating and we were deeply impressed by the students’ creativity.Two sisters composed, performed, and produced a music video for a song titled \"华佗\" (Huatuo), inspired by the tale of a renowned physician in their Chinese textbook. Those of us who read Chinese martial arts novels would be familiar with “Huatuo\". The catchy tune and accessible lyrics of the song allow the story to shine through to the youth and enable a better understanding of not only Huatuo, but also traditional Chinese medicine and the essence of Chinese culture. We will release this video in the near future and I encourage all of you to watch it, and share it with your family and friends.There are many wonderful examples that can be drawn from this competition. Like the sisters, many of our students’ work have been reproduced as useful lesson materials for our teachers.We believe that the collective energy and support of schools, families, the media, the entertainment circle, and the larger community, will sustain a vibrant ecosystem to ignite students' interest and love for their MTL, be it Chinese, Tamil, or Malay.(In English): Mr Chairman, Sir, please allow me to also share examples of the work of our Malay and Tamil Language Learning Promotion Committees in making MTL learning relatable, in making MTL learning enjoyable. Since 2018, the \"Perkasa Warisan\" camp has brought together community partners, as Miss Cheng Li Hui mentioned earlier, to provide immersive experiences, specifically tied to the language and also the cultural components of the Malay language curriculum, such as activities on the art of Malay gastronomy.Tech-savvy youths from NUS and also the youths from NTU have made learning Tamil fun for Upper Primary students, through a programme called \"Artificial Intelligence and Tamil Language\". This programme allows our students to learn the language in the context of coding application and software and then apply it in novel and also technological settings.I am confident that the committees will continue to bring together the passion, the creativity and energy of our schools, parents, media and the community to sustain a vibrant eco-system for students to like, to learn and to use their MTL as living languages. Mr Chairman, Sir, apart from reinforcing our bilingual foundations, MOE is also committed to developing the whole child through a broad-based and holistic curriculum. This includes, as Miss Cheng Li Hui suggested, engaging our youths in current issues, like climate change to foster in them traits of active citizenship and a shared concern for Singapore and the world.We currently integrate the topic of climate change across various subjects at different levels of the national curriculum. Secondary school students, for example, will learn in Geography lessons the effects of climate change on our food supply chain and also the forests. In Science, they will investigate how human activities disrupt the carbon cycle, contribute to climate change and threaten our environment.As part of the curriculum development process, we also consult MEWR and other relevant authorities to provide our students with the most up-to-date and accurate information on climate change. More importantly, we hone our students' ability in discerning the news and also engage them in inquiry-based learning and discussion so that our students are guided to examine different sources of information critically.Beyond the classroom, many schools have programmes that partner the community to promote environmental causes and give our students the chance to translate their knowledge into action. For instance, students are trained to become \"Junior Environmental Ambassadors\" in the Green Schools programme by the South West Community Development Council (South West CDC) and NEA. As part of their training, they go through modules on the environment like energy efficiency and climate change, as well as the 4Rs that we are all very familiar with. The 4Rs are to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and most recently, to Refuse. This further instils in our students, green practices and mind-sets like waste minimisation.Many Members are very active on the ground, in the community; you will agree with me that students are our best ambassadors, because when they go back and tell their mummy, daddy or grandparents, \"You forgot to switch off the aircon, you forgot to switch off the lights\", I think the whole family will remember the green practices. So, we are counting on our students to really spread the word for us.Last year, close to 300 student ambassadors across 49 schools completed their training and went on to champion green initiatives in their schools in the South West district. The other CDCs are also implementing similar green initiatives with the schools in their districts.Also central to holistic education, is the students' participation in co-curricular activities (CCAs), which allow them to discover their interest and talents, forge friendships with peers of diverse backgrounds, as well as develop character and resilience. We are glad that Miss Cheng Li Huisupports our initiative to pilot the removal of CCA selection trials to help our students develop their passions, regardless of their prior experiences and backgrounds.As part of our on-going efforts to redefine CCA experiences, MOE is also exploring how to better promote social mixing and inclusivity through CCAs, as advocated by Ms Cheng. Currently, we are piloting combined teams where two schools run a CCA programme together, and where appropriate, send a combined team to participate in the National School Games (NSG) or Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.As students work together towards a common purpose, there will be plenty of opportunities for them to learn, to appreciate differences, to pick up skills like relationship management. We are starting this with five pairs of schools. In time to come, we believe our CCA experiences will better support our students' holistic growth.Mr Chairman, to conclude, I recap the educator's quote that I started with, \"Our job is not to prepare students for something. Our job is to help students prepare themselves for anything\". Yes, we should help our students prepare themselves for anything that may come their way. In so doing, we will raise a generation of Singaporeans with a sense of confidence over their lives and their future, no matter what uncertainties a changing world may hold. To this end, MOE will continue to work with stakeholders to nurture our youths to become active citizens with a love to Learn for Life, and willing to act for a better Singapore that we collectively own.The Chairman: Clarifications. Ms Denise Phua.Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng: I thank the Minister and Second Minister as well. Just a few questions on Tree for Life. First, on my suggestion to rename or consider the idea of Ministry of Education being the Ministry of Lifelong Learning. Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat just mentioned that MOE is now providing a continuum of learning opportunities for Singaporeans for the entire life. I thought that a new name might reflect better MOE's new vision and mission.Also, education somehow, smacks of a one-way flow: of I educate you, I teach you; versus the idea of self-driven learning whereby the ownership is put on the people who are learning. That is one question.My second question is on the transformation map. I do appreciate the Tree for Life. I would like to seek indulgence to help to prune the Tree a little bit and to suggest some modifications. One is the fruit. It will be great, if in this so-called transformation map in the form of a tree, the types of fruit could be articulated better in terms of what kind of students you want to see; what kind of learners; and what kind of desired outcomes, including how we will benchmark – my point which Minister maybe forgot to respond to – benchmark what would be the success of our education system versus the usual ones that we are quite used to – PISA rankings and so forth.The next is the ground in the graphic of Tree for Life. For the ground, we could specify the foundational principles by which our uniquely Singapore education system should aspire towards. Principles like equal access, and a lot of the things that are already being done in our country, like being inclusive, like being collaborative, like always looking at future-proofing and looking ahead. Those could be the foundational principles that occupy the ground from which this tree grows.The third is in terms of the branches in the Tree for Life. I thought that many of the things that Ministers, Senior Minister of State and Senior Parliamentary Secretaries have mentioned are to do with enablers. The branches are really the enablers. How we look at the future roles of staff, be they education leaders or educators, the curriculum, the content to teach, the pedagogy by which we teach. These are great enablers that can be considered as the branches.And then, there is also the weather condition. Beyond the Tree per se – but the conditions on how we are all conditioned to think of as, like a certain way, when we look at education in our country; and some of the driving forces to support what MOE is trying to do —The Chairman: Ms Denise Phua, can you keep it to clarification, instead of another speech?Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng: Would Minister consider all of that, and also maybe add an element of innovation in the graphic so that we could consider for example, schools that may not have to go through the PSLE or a Parent Academy.Chairman, on Special Education Needs. A couple of questions. I think it is great news that the SEN Fund for IHLs has been extended to those who not just have physical disabilities, but also to those with Dyslexia, ADHD and ASD. But the amount given is $5,000, if I heard correctly. In the actual original fund, there is $25,000 for those with hearing and visual impairment. I was wondering why the extension is for $5,000, and not $25,000, why not in between?There are physical devices but we need therapists, coach services too.The Chairman: How many supplementary questions are there, Ms Denise Phua? If you can just keep it succinct, please.1.00 pmMs Denise Phua Lay Peng: Yes. My last question is an appeal to extend the special school years for all of the SPED students – not just those who are currently allowed to study until 21, but for all of them to be able to stay until the age 21. Because they just need that longer runway to enable them to be more independent in daily living and to allow them to perhaps have a better chance to do some supported employment work.Mr Ong Ye Kung: I think the analogy of a tree cannot be pushed too far, but that is always the danger when you use an analogy. Foundational principles – I totally agree with Ms Denise Phua. When we came up with this \"Tree for Life\" and the Learn for Life movement, we were focusing on the deltas. What are the main changes we want to make. One example is UPLIFT, which is something that we are putting a lot more resources to.But surely, all the principles that the Member mentioned earlier – they continue to be relevant. But this tree is focusing on the delta. As I mentioned in my speech, it will guide us in our actions for the next five to 10 years – the key changes that we want to see in the system.The Member's points on the branches, on the different kinds of fruits – actually, if we want students of different abilities to have different pathways, one fruit is not enough. You need a whole orchard of different kinds of fruits. So, again, the analogy cannot be taken too far.But I take all of the Member's points. These are all valid. That is why I say the education system must always be a work in progress. While we say we have a plan for the next five to 10 years, I am sure along the way, there will be new initiatives, new imperatives and we have to change again.I will leave the Second Minister to answer the question on SEN, but on the renaming to the Ministry for Lifelong Learning – we agree with the essence of what the Member said. I think the essence of what the Member wishes MOE will do, we will do. If we do it well, we achieve what we want to do, and promote lifelong learning the way we want to, at that point in time, maybe we can think about a change of our name.The Chairman: Ms Indranee Rajah.Ms Indranee Rajah: I need to respond to Ms Denise Phua's many supplementary questions.The first clarification Ms Denise Phua had was – how come it is $5,000 for the SEN Fund for those with social and behavioural conditions instead of $25,000? Currently, under the SEN Fund, eligible students with physical impairment can tap up to $5,000 on the SEN Fund. So, it is pegged to that. Eligible students with visual or hearing loss can tap up to $25,000 and that is because for those with visual or hearing loss, the expenses are higher for them in terms of the assistive devices, that is one; as well as the services.So, for example, for the assistive devices, they may need an assistive learning system, talking calculators, reader pens. Those are generally more expensive than other types of devices. And also, supporting services. For example, hearing loss. You may need somebody to do sign language and then you obviously have to cover that. And for the blind students, sometimes you need note-taking services. So, it is scoped depending on the need and basically, for hearing loss and visual impairment, thecost of the devices and support is higher.Do not forget, we have just extended the SEN Fund to students with learning and behavioural needs, and this is just a start. So, the high-needs category may not be so applicable to them. But this much I can assure Ms Denise Phua, which is that MOE will continue to work with our IHLs and we will review the SEN Fund periodically. Our ultimate aim is to ensure that the students with SEN are adequately supported with the necessary devices that they need.Ms Denise Phua also made a passionate plea for us to keep some of the students in the SPED schools for longer, up to age 21. Well, there are two things that we are doing, which will partially address that. But I agree that there is much more that we can look at, to see how we can support those who leave school. So, let me just take them in turn.The first thing is, MOE has already started in the SPED schools a school-wide process of transition planning for all the SPED students at the Secondary age. The school has developed an individual transition plan for each student, working with the students, the care-givers and the family, and the idea is really to help them to be able to cope when they leave school. So, that is the first thing, and this will apply to all the SPED students, irrespective of whether or not they may be able to go into open employment, or not. So, that is number one – prepare them all for when they leave school.Number two, we have the School-to-Work Transition Programme in all the SPED schools and that is to offer customised training pathways cum work options for the students, who have diverse disability profiles, who may not benefit from the vocational certification but they are still capable of work. The School-to-Work Transition Programme begins in the student's final year of schooling, when he or she is referred to SG Enable and matched to a suitable employment or training pathway, and the programme continues for one year after he or she graduates, during which he or she is supported by SG Enable. While on the programme, the students receive customised job training, job support from job coaches to prepare them for eventual employment.That said, I think Ms Denise Phua's concern really is that there may be some who are not able to do open employment and her appeal is, can we keep them in the school system? But even if we did that, even up to age 21, there are still some, who, after age 21, still cannot cope with open employment. I think what Ms Denise Phua wants to do is to sort of lengthen the runway.So, one step at a time. I think we have spent the last decade or so really ensuring that SPED is strengthened, that we have got good quality in terms of the content as well as the teachers and those who can provide the programmes. And you can see we are now taking the next step, which is helping them to transition beyond school and those who can go to open employment.So, I think I can say this – we agree that that is certainly an area that has to be looked into, for those who cannot go into open employment. Work in progress, and we will be very happy to partner all the stakeholders in this space to come up and see what is the best thing for them. It may or may not be retaining them in school. It may be something else. But what we really want is that no matter what it is, when you leave SPED school, you also want those with special needs to be able to live lives which are as productive as possible, and which also gives their care-givers a sense of assurance, that their loved ones with special needs are engaged and have something to do, and are in an environment which is conducive for them.The Chairman: Ms Foo Mee Har.Ms Foo Mee Har: Thank you, Sir. I have two questions for the Senior Minister of State on SkillsFuture. First, thank you for very much for the range of exciting initiatives on SkillsFuture. The first clarification I have is that I ask the Senior Minister of State how the next phase of SkillsFuture movement will bring about a closer link between the CET courses and employability. I spoke about the challenge amongst the thousands of courses and people needed help to navigate. What do I need to do? What skills do I have to achieve based on the CET courses offered that would link me to a very good employment outcome, especially those 40 to 60 years old, the same group we are trying to help.The second clarification I have for the Senior Minister of State is on the SkillsFuture Queen Bee initiative. It is a very exciting initiative and there were so very impressive numbers being mentioned, that SMEs are being brought on board. I asked in my speech if the Senior Minister of State can give more details about how this new model works, maybe specifically give some details on the governance, the funding, whether there is any certification involved, so that some of the skills can be portable. So, just really going a bit deeper about if these Queen Bees are going to be schools of the industries, how are they going to be governed, how are they going to be funded, and the quality control about the programmes.Mr Chee Hong Tat: Mr Chairman, I thank Ms Foo Mee Har for her two supplementary questions. For the first, she is right that because we offer so many different kinds of courses, it is useful for people to get some advisory, some guidance. If I take this course, what are some of the pathways that may be open to me? What are some of the outcomes that I can benefit from? This is going to be done through two channels, mainly. The first one, of course, we are going to do it through the portal. So, the portal will be enhanced to be able to provide some of this information based on the individual's profile, needs, and make some recommendations.But we understand that some Singaporeans will want a more face-to-face interaction, because they are then able to interact with the advisor, they are able to get some guidance to point them in the right direction. So that is why we are going to work through the SkillsFuture Advice. But this time round, we will go beyond the community, which is what we have been doing for the past few years, to work with the career centres. This will be in collaboration with MOM, Workforce Singapore and also with our unions. And as I mentioned earlier, also with private sector entities that can come in and provide some of these advisory services on a commercial basis.Through this process, we hope to be able to supplement the support that we give to individuals and help them to make those decisions.The other point that I will just mention briefly is that part of having a closer linkage between training and employability, where we also have to curate the quality of the training courses. And that is also what we will do in the next bound – to further raise the quality of the training providers. That is going to be one of the key priorities too.Ms Foo Mee Har's second question on Queen Bees. This is work in progress. We have lined up some companies but every sector is different. Some Queen Bees, like in the case of SP Group, are there because they have many links with suppliers and contractors in the sector. So, they are able to then influence what these SMEs do. Because these SMEs, many of them are their suppliers, their contractors. But in some cases, it is not quite like that. The people who are participating and the SMEs may not be direct contractors or suppliers, but they are part of the industry.So, the model needs to be customised depending on which Queen Bee company we are working with, which sector we are working on. But I think the fundamental principle remains that what we want is to be able to have these Queen Bee companies to take the lead and work with us as partners, to be able to raise the training opportunities and resources available to other companies and workers within the sector.The Chairman: Prof Lim Sun Sun.Prof Lim Sun Sun: I thank the Minister's for the various announcements and I also appreciate the attention to level the playing field for students from different family backgrounds.I first have a clarification. I would like to find out if there will be greater effort to introduce social emotional training for teachers so that there is greater self-awareness on the part of teachers, and that they better understand how they relate not just to their colleagues but also to their students, so as to build a healthier classroom environment.The second is a comment on the device ownership scheme. I appreciate that there are many virtues to personal device usage in schools, but there are also certain pitfalls that we need to think about. Previous research has shown that device ownership actually involves many components, including device purchase, device maintenance, software maintenance as well as software usage. And families are clearly differently advantaged in being able to provide the guidance. So, I have found in my own research that parents from less well-heeled backgrounds face severe inadequacy and severe anxiety in terms of their inability to support their children in this way.In other words, unless we have very concerted, very comprehensive support and augmentation within schools for IT support for students from different backgrounds, you may find that some of these introductions of device usage may introduce different kinds of inequalities. So, I hope due attention can be paid to this issue.Mr Ong Ye Kung: Prof Lim Sun Sun talked about microaggression yesterday. I do not think it is widespread. I do not deny that sometimes it can happen, but I do not think it is so widespread that we have to roll out a national training programme for our teachers. Where teachers cannot control their anger or in the rare occasions that it happens, I think they ought to be counselled. Over time, as they gain experience, they will have more patience and have the skills to handle difficult situations as opposed to losing their cool. I think actually all of us need those kind of skills. But it does not mean we get angry all the time.1.15 pmAs for the second question on the device, these are practical issues we really have to look at on the ground, which is why before we roll out any national programme, we always pilot it first. We have piloted in these eight schools and all these issues the Member raised happened, all happened – Wifi kept dropping, all these things happened. But with the experience that we have gained so far, these practical problems can be resolved and we make sure they are resolved before we roll out nationally.The Chairman: Dr Intan.Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar: Thank you, Chairman. I seek your kind indulgence for four clarifications.First, I support the National Digital Literacy programme but, as I mentioned in my speech, Minister, I hope that MOE will consider including information literacy as well because it is not sufficient for students to just learn to develop skills and knowledge to make use of digital tools and platforms but also understand how to navigate the massive amounts of information available that traverses all these various digital tools and platforms. That is one.Second, for the SkillsFuture for educators, I understand that MOE will be working with NIE as well as private training providers, external training providers, for both in-service and pre-service courses, and which may also include online learning modules. Will this be fully funded by MOE or will teachers have to tap on the SkillsFuture Credit, for example?Third, I have not spoken it in this Committee of Supply but I have spoken about this before. It is good that we are strengthening the support for students with SEN in our schools. Are there plans to recruit more AED(LBS) because at the moment, there are only one or two AED(LBS) to cater to 80% of our students with special educational needs. My son is one of them. I hope that there will be a lot more AED(LBS) because it will certainly help our students with special education needs in the mainstream schools.And, last, the expansion of the intake places for Work Study programmes. I must declare that I am from SIT as a faculty member. SIT was the first to start the Work-Study programmes. With the expansion, is it that there will be ramping up of programmes within SIT or will it be ruled out to all the AUs?Mr Ong Ye Kung: Yes, as I mentioned, the four components of digital literacy simplified – Find, Think, Apply, Create. What the Member has mentioned is under \"Find\". Certainly, we will look at it; I fully agree with the Member.Second, our SkillsFuture for Educators is fully funded, just as at NIE, our training at the, Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST), they are fully funded for our teachers. It is not just online and courses. One important modality for teachers when they learn is to do so in a professional community, learning from each other. You can make use of online platforms but teachers appreciate that the most, when professionals can come together and learn from each other. We have to fully leverage on that.On AED(LBS), answer is yes, some schools are doing very interesting initiatives on the ground, beefing up AED(LBS) and also doing things differently. Not ready to talk about it in great detail this time, but certainly we are looking at it.On Work-Study Programme, certainly, if we want to increase to 12% and become a mainstream pathway of every cohort, we certainly need all hands on deck. SIT being an applied University, surely it is one of our big partners that we hope will roll out more. I hope Dr Intan will push for it back in her institution.Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, I am very heartened and I also thank both Ministers for their resounding assurances that we are finally introducing mental health education in schools, and also that MOE will be providing more and better trained counsellors to schools. I cannot agree more with Minister Indranee that we need a whole child and whole school and an ecosystem to address students' mental well-being. So, I have two clarifications.The first one is that a clear big piece within this eco-system in addressing students' well-being, mental well-being, particularly, would be the parents. I am wondering how and when are parents engaged by the schools for a student in distress, and also if we are including parents in the mental health education that we are introducing in some way. I also wonder if one way could be reaching these parents through their employers and that there might be an inter-Ministry initiative with MOM, given the announcement in terms of the Workplace Mental Health Advisory.The second clarification is, does the Ministry have, or if not, does it intend to have a clear and robust Suicide Prevention strategy in schools, especially given the record number of teenage suicides that we had in 2018 that was announced last year?Ms Indranee Rajah: I thank the Member for her clarification. The Member is correct that the parents are actually a very important part of this, and our teachers do engage the parents, especially when the teachers find that their child has a mental health issue. So, the plan to engage parents is very much a part of it.When the Member refers to a suicide prevention strategy, actually, that strategy is the peer support network or the programme that I talked about. Because in my speech, I had outlined how it is actually a whole eco-system.If a child is depressed, worried, the first people to pick it up will be the friends, the friends are the first ones. And if it is not too big an issue, the friends can provide support, then that is great. But if it needs a little bit more than that, then you would want to bring it to the attention of the teacher. And the teacher can resolve it, that is fine, but if not, you may have to go to the professional counsellor. And then, from the counsellor, you may have to go to specialised external service providers. So, you can see that it is one layer after another layer, but all to have a protective environment around a student who has got mental health issues.Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong): MOE has done a lot of transformation for the past few years. I would like to thank the Minister and his team for their passion, hard work and determination as well. I have two clarifications for the Ministers.First, we are glad that MOE is providing generous bursaries for students at the Polytechnic and also Universities. We also note that at the University, especially, the tuition fee has been increasing year after year for the past. I do not know whether MOE is continuing with this policy of increasing the tuition fee every year. If it is so, then will the bursary also increase year after year?The second clarification is that we are glad that that AUs are taking 2,800 ICT students this academic year. It is about two, three times more compared to the past. Does the Minister have a breakdown of these ICT students by the six Universities? And also, whether the Universities are working with the industrial players to co-create a curriculum, so that the skill-sets acquired by all these students will be matched by the demand of the industry?Mr Ong Ye Kung: On fees, the Prime Minister actually spoke about this at great length during the National Day Rally. For thecost of ITE education, we fund over 90%. For Polytechnics, the Government fund about 85%. And then, for University, the Government funds about 75%. Today, we are pretty much there for most courses. Some courses are still out of whack, so over time, we may need to adjust. But for most courses, we are pretty much there.From henceforth, we need to adjust fees from time to time in order to reflectcost inflation. And bursaries, from time to time, also probably have to adjust, so that education remains affordable. Our principle is very clear: no one who gains a place in an IHL should be denied of studying, of education, because of financial circumstances.As for breakdown of ICT students, I do not have the numbers but a lot are coming from NUS, which has been really beefing up and ramping up their courses. Because the courses, the places, are ramped up so fast, you cannot really get sufficient professors. So, you actually have no choice and, just as well, we rely a lot on practitioners. Indeed, this is very valuable. With their experience, the students gain skills that are very relevant to the market. If you look at their employment results, the ICT students are doing pretty well.The Chairman: Ms Denise Phua, would you like to withdraw your amendment?Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng: I thank the Ministers, Senior Minister of State, Senior Parliament Secretaries and the team behind you, somewhere in the room in Parliament, for providing such a comprehensive and well considered response to the speeches and requests from my fellow parliamentarians and I. As I said, I really want to deeply thank those who have chosen to serve in this sector, whether in mainstream, special education or in the IHLs. And as I said too, your influence is deeply felt even after the students are long gone. So, thank you so much for doing this. With that, Mr Chairman, I now beg leave to withdraw my amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $12,861,226,400 for Head K ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $644,000,000 for Head K ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates."

        "Content": "Order for Second Reading read.2.29 pmThe Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I begin, I would like to acknowledge the presence of 31 individuals from our 3P sectors who are here in this House for the reading of this Bill.Just last week, my Ministry launched Singapore's inaugural Zero Waste Masterplan, a critical achievement in this Year Towards Zero Waste. This is a limited print edition of the Masterplan. In the spirit of Zero Waste, you can access the Masterplan on our Towards Zero Waste website too.The Masterplan draws on ideas and contributions from a vast array of our population. The Masterplan lays out our strategies and policies to close our resource loops via a circular economy approach and to achieve our vision of a Zero Waste Nation. The Resource Sustainability Bill will give effect to the policies and targets outlined in the Masterplan.The Masterplan also marks an important milestone in Singapore's sustainable development journey over the last five decades.Back in the 1970s, my family wrapped our household waste in newspapers. Food waste was manually collected in little buckets outside our homes and used as swill in our farms, and in return, we received some eggs. I am not sure how many people in this House remember that. From time to time, we experienced the waft of interesting odours.Today, things are very different. Waste disposal is clean and hygienic and we make use of pneumatic technology to convey waste from our chutes to a collection point for subsequent disposal. \"Clean and Green\" has become synonymous with Singapore. And we have also demonstrated that environmental protection can co-exist with economic growth. Indeed, we were ranked Asia's most sustainable city in the 2018 Sustainability Cities Index and second in the 2018 World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index.We have come a long way, but we must do more to ensure that the next generation continues to enjoy a liveable and sustainable home. Doing our part for the environment is even more critical now as we seek to address climate change. Someone has said that we should never argue about climate change – it always turns into a \"heated debate\", if you pardon the pun.But climate change is no joking matter. As highlighted by the Prime Minister in his recent National Day Rally Speech, climate change is undoubtedly a massive existential challenge confronting our next generation. To tackle climate change, we need a paradigm shift – from the \"take-make-throw\" linear model to the circular economy where resources are used over and over again. Efficient waste disposal is necessary, but our goal must first and foremost be to reduce, reuse and recycle; in other words, zero waste. This is the core of the Resource Sustainability Bill.What we produce, consume, and throw away all have an impact on the climate. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, Special Report released last year, current rates of human activity may lead to 1.5°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030. We must therefore change our current patterns of production and consumption to reduce emissions and limit global warming. Our zero waste efforts will play a key role. They will help cut down on carbon intensive activities along the supply chain, and reduce the amount of heat-trapping emissions we put into the atmosphere.We face a second challenge. Global economic growth is driving resource consumption at an unsustainable rate. Studies show that we are at the limits of Planet Earth’s ability to fulfil our resource needs.Take lithium, for instance, which is used in batteries for electric cars, laptops and smartphones. Demand for lithium has tripled in the last decade. Companies which rely on lithium to make batteries, along with cobalt and nickel, warn of impending shortages of such critical materials. The message is clear and ominous. If we do not change our habits, there will simply not be enough resources to sustain our way of life.Mr Deputy Speaker, it is to confront these challenges that my Ministry is working to build up a three-fold resilience for Singapore.First, climate resilience. We must address the existential threats of climate change, especially rising sea levels, and cope with rising temperatures and extreme rainfall patterns. We are building up our knowledge of climate science to guide our actions to protect Singapore. We are also stepping up efforts to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. Apart from how we transform our industry, transport and energy sectors to pursue sustainable production and consumption, our zero waste efforts are key.Second, resource resilience. We must overcome global resource constraints, and ensure a safe and secure supply of critical resources such as water, food and other materials. Closing resource loops and turning waste into resource will reduce our vulnerability to global supply shocks. One way that this can be done is through urban mining. A research group from Tsinghua University in China has found that recovering resources like gold, copper and other metals from e-waste is 13 times cheaper than mining them. In the process we do not need to go back to nature to exploit and restore it. The World Economic Forum estimates that 50 million tonnes of e-waste, equivalent to 120,000 jumbo jets, are produced globally each year. Of this, only 20% is recycled.Imagine the potential in urban mining where precious metals can be mined from e-waste, and energy from food waste. What more if NewSand can be \"mined\" from incineration bottom ash! We can then \"save\" Semakau and extend its useful life beyond 2035. Figuratively speaking, we can look at Semakau not as a landfill for trash but as a treasure island right in our very own backyard.Third, economic resilience. For Singapore companies to continue to thrive in the future economy, they must adapt to the growing constraints on carbon and other resources. Globally, a number of businesses are already taking the lead to adopt a more circular supply chain. This could entail using recycled materials as raw materials, extending the life of products or recovering resources from products at the end of life. Unilever has introduced post-consumer recycled waste materials into products such as dishwashing liquid detergent bottles, with some of their brands using 100% recycled PET packaging. Similarly, automobile companies like General Motors and BMW are working with renewable-energy storage suppliers to create an aftermarket for end-of-life batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles.These new business models will open new economic opportunities and create good jobs for Singaporeans. Preliminary studies have estimated that if Singapore recovers and reuses materials from e-waste, we can reap a net benefit of $40 million. This includes indirect benefits such as helping our companies export overseas and creating jobs.Singapore must adopt a circular economy approach to build these three resiliences and sustain future growth. We must make every effort to close our resource loops and reuse our resources for as long as possible and this is not new to us. We have done so for water, and in fact, even for waste streams such as construction and demolition waste. This is the approach we must also take for other resources.Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is in this spirit that we move this Bill. The Resource Sustainability Bill will, for the first time, put in place a systems-level approach that mandates key responsibilities to enable reuse and recycling nation-wide. This will complement and support the voluntary efforts of our people and private sectors.The Bill will bring our regulatory framework upstream. It will send economic signals to producers such as manufacturers and importers to take into account thecost of environmental externalities. It also encourages innovation and the redesigning of products that require less materials, last longer and are more easily recycled.The regulatory framework will also fund the recovery and aggregation of useful materials such as metals from e-waste, which makes recycling more viable. We will target the three priority waste streams of electrical and electronic waste, or e-waste, packaging waste including plastics, and food waste. Let me explain why we are focusing on these three waste streams.E-waste generation is growing exponentially with rising affluence. Singapore generates about 60,000 tonnes of e-waste annually, yet very little is recycled. This translates to each person throwing away the equivalent of six mobile phones every month.Such waste may contain heavy metals and other hazardous substances, and improper disposal may lead to the contamination of our environment and harm public health. Precious metals like gold are also being thrown away. We will introduce the Extended Producer Responsibility or EPR approach to e-waste by 2021, to ensure the proper handling and extraction of resources from e-waste. This will mandate producers of covered electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) to be responsible for the collection and proper treatment of their e-waste. All producers of covered EEE will need to register with NEA. Producers of consumer products which exceed the prescribed thresholds will need to join the Producer Responsibility Scheme (PRS) and finance the collection and recycling of e-waste. In return, the PRS operator will be responsible for meeting e-waste collection targets set by NEA.To minimise the regulatory impact on smaller players, we have set thresholds to exempt smaller producers, which supply about 10% of the consumer products that are put-to-market in Singapore by weight, from joining the PRS. This means that producers of 90% of the consumer products put-to-market in Singapore will be subjected to the EPR framework. We will monitor the implementation of the EPR framework, and ensure that these thresholds remain relevant.The next priority waste stream is packaging waste, including plastics. We generate large amounts of this – around a third of the total domestic waste disposed of in Singapore. Almost all of this packaging material is incinerated.This ensures that the environmental impacts are managed effectively, and our packaging, including plastics do not end up in the sea, mangling creatures such as cute baby dugongs in Thailand. However, we ought to do more to reduce and recycle packaging. External forces are also changing the economics of the recycling industry. China’s ban on the import of plastic waste has shifted the trade patterns of plastic recyclables. As a result, our plastics recycling rate, which hovered around 10%, dropped to 4% in 2018. We cannot continue with business as usual. We can and must do more to better manage packaging, including plastics.As a start, next year, we will implement mandatory reporting of packaging data as well as plans to reduce, reuse or recycle packaging, including plastics.The requirements will apply, for a start, to companies with an annual turnover of over $10 million. This will cover approximately 4,500 medium and large enterprises in Singapore who put packaging on the market. Micro and small enterprises will be exempted. This reporting will focus management attention on the packaging that companies are placing on the market and spur reduction efforts that will save themcosts. This will lay the ground for an EPR framework for packaging waste, which will be put in place no later than 2025, if not earlier.Third, food waste is a major waste stream with high generation tonnage and low recycling rates. In 2018, we generated 763,000 tonnes of food waste. Of this, only 17% was recycled.From 2024, we will make it mandatory for the owners and occupiers of commercial and industrial premises which generate large amounts of food waste, to segregate their food waste for treatment.We will also require owners and occupiers of new buildings which are expected to be large food waste generators, to treat food waste on-site. In preparation for this, we will require developers of new buildings which are expected to be large food waste generators, to make provisions for on-site treatment of food waste in development plans submitted from 2021. These new requirements will ensure that food waste from large food waste generators is diverted for treatment or converted into useful products, such as compost and animal feed, instead of being incinerated.This will also reduce odour and pest nuisances at the premises, and reduce the contamination of recyclables by food waste, allowing for greater resource recovery.We will complement the regulatory frameworks with other measures. These include educational campaigns, co-creation efforts with the community and grants to support ground-up initiatives. For example, NEA launched the \"Say YES to Waste Less\" campaign in June as part of the Year Towards Zero Waste movement to reduce the excessive consumption of disposables and packaging and encourage the use of reusables. NEA has also launched the \"Towards Zero Waste Grant\" to support individuals, interest groups, NGOs, grassroots organisations and corporations to initiate or scale up waste reduction and recycling initiatives. A vibrant Zero Waste eco-system will encourage our citizens to reduce, reuse and recycle. Our regulatory measures will be key in incentivising producers to play an active role in building this Zero Waste eco-system with us.Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now highlight the main elements of the Resource Sustainability Bill.Part 3 of the Bill establishes the EPR framework for e-waste. Clause 8 requires producers, as defined in the Bill, to register with NEA in order to supply regulated products, and clause 12 requires large producers above prescribed thresholds to join a Producer Responsibility Scheme (PRS) before they can supply regulated consumer products.For producers of regulated non-consumer products, clause 13 requires them to collect any of such products upon request by customers at no charge.Clause 14 requires retailers to offer a one-for-one collection of an unwanted product at no charge when retailers deliver a product of the same type to a customer. Clause 15 requires large retailers to provide in-store collection of e-waste. Retailers are important stakeholders in this EPR framework for e-waste, and are often the interface with customers.To ensure that e-waste is properly managed and disposed of, clauses 16 and 17 lay out restrictions on the collection and disposal of e-waste to ensure proper treatment.The next part of the Bill, Part 4, establishes the mandatory reporting framework for packaging, including plastics. Clause 20 requires producers of specified packaging that fulfil the threshold criteria to report on the packaging they introduce onto the Singapore market. They will also be required to submit plans to NEA to reduce, reuse or recycle packaging under clause 21. As mentioned earlier, the threshold criteria will, for a start, be set at an annual turnover of above $10 million.Part 5 establishes the mandatory segregation of food waste for treatment for buildings which are large generators of food waste.Clause 25 requires occupiers of a prescribed building to segregate their food waste and dispose of it in a facility provided by the building manager, who will be obligated to provide such facilities under clause 26. Clause 27 requires the building managers of prescribed buildings to also ensure the treatment of all food waste.Part 6 covers the requirements on operators of the PRS. They are fundamental in any EPR framework as they establish the network for public collection of the regulated waste and ensure that the waste collected is properly treated and recycled. Clause 28 will require operators of the PRS to be licensed. Clauses 30 to 32 empower NEA to determine the conditions of the licence and to take necessary actions to ensure effective operation of the PRS.As NEA will be providing the licensee with certain information submitted by obligated producers for the purpose of the EPR, clause 36 makes it an offence for the licensee or former licensees to disclose any confidential information received from NEA. This will ensure the confidentiality of data to safeguard the interests of producers.Part 7 contains the provisions necessary for the enforcement of the Bill. Clauses 37 to 40 empower authorised officers to request for information and documents from any person, and enter any non-residential premises to investigate or monitor compliance with the provisions of the Bill. Clause 41 penalises anyone who hinders an authorised officer in the performance of his or her duty.Part 8 contains miscellaneous provisions necessary for the administration of the Bill. As a large part of the regulations is dependent on information furnished by the obligated persons, clause 42 makes the provision of any false or misleading information an offence. To safeguard information, clause 43 prohibits NEA from disclosing any confidential information or document except in accordance with the clause.The penalties laid out in the Bill are in line with other similar legislation, such as the Energy Conservation Act and the Environmental Public Health Act.Mr Deputy Speaker, it is clear that business as usual in the way we produce and consume is not sustainable. The impacts of climate change and the carbon and resource constraints we face respect no geographical or national boundaries. The Resource Sustainability Bill is an integral part of our strategy to close resource loops through a circular economy approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Not only will it contribute to environmental sustainability, it will also help to build up the three resiliences – climate, economic and resource. Only by doing so can we create a sustainable Singapore of tomorrow and secure our collective future for our children.Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.Question proposed.2.53 pmEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we need to take a strong stance on global warming. We cannot afford to leave it to future generations to worry about. I am glad to hear that we are planning for both climate change and rising sea levels and doing our best to use resources sustainably. The Zero Waste Masterplan launched last week highlighted that we want to cut waste sent to the landfill by 30%. This is a worthwhile goal but a very big one. We will all need to pull together to achieve it.I often hear Singaporeans say, \"But we are such a small country, how can we make a difference?\" Indeed, our carbon footprint is comparatively low compared to other larger countries. Our global emissions amount to about 0.1%.But this effort can put us as a world leader on the international stage and, hopefully, we can inspire others to do their part. Actions from everyone add up. If everybody thinks tackling climate change is someone else's responsibility, then who will take responsibility?This Resource Sustainability Bill, which aims to improve waste management in Singapore and support businesses to reduce and recycle their waste, is a step in the right direction.The Bill does well to hold key producers of various types of waste accountable for waste management and reduction. I would like to ask: when businesses report how they will cut down on excessive packaging, do they have to meet a certain target? What will be the targets set? How will they be monitored? If companies do not meet the targets, what penalties will be imposed? We need ambitious targets to ensure that companies take this seriously but, at the same time, it should not be too onerous. Companies should not be unduly over-pressurised by this requirement. After all, doing business nowadays is not easy.At the same time, the Government also needs to simplify reporting as much as possible and train companies accordingly. Will the new requirements raise the prices of goods? This is my concern.Some eateries, hawker centres and fast food restaurants, for example, provide single-use plastic spoons and forks for customers having their meals on-site. Are these single-use items regulated as packaging? If not, that could become a loophole in the law.Next, if the Minister can explain more on electrical and electronic waste. Given the expected increase in volume of e-waste, can our current e-waste recycling capability cope? What are the plans to grow this capability?Next, on food waste. It concerns me that building managers will have difficulties implementing segregation and treating of food waste on-site, especially if occupiers of the prescribed buildings do not cooperate. This would be just like our HDB recycling bins, where just one uncooperative person can contaminate the whole bin.Can the Minister elaborate, how massive is this exercise? How many buildings would fall within this category? How many NEA-operated hawker centres have such facilities at the moment? How would food prices at hawker centres, coffeeshops, schools and so on be affected? Are there local commercial buildings that have already adopted the practice of segregating and/or treating food waste on-site? What are their challenges, the results and benefits?The law is mainly focused on businesses. But individual actions will make a difference, too. What I hope to see is this message trickling down to individuals. Nothing is too small or too little to combat climate change for our next generation. On this note, I would like to take this opportunity to once again call for a charge on plastic bags. The impact may be insignificant, as the Senior Minister of State alluded to in her reply to my Parliamentary Question recently. But I strongly believe that such a gesture will make people more conscious of what they do, how many plastic bags do they need and such consciousness will have knock-off effects on their daily lives and the consumption pattern. Certainly, we must stop consuming more than what we need. Reduce, reuse, recycle must be the norm of our society. Fighting climate change should not be the job of just the Government. Everyone has a role to play. And we have to do this seriously for the survival of our country and for our next generation.I have mentioned recycling bins. Can we please do more to get all residents to use recycling bins appropriately? Are there plans to improve the heartland recycling network? Also, many depend on the \"karang guni\" man to dispose of our unwanted items. How will this new Bill impact their trade?Another facet of our life is the PMDs. How are people to dispose of their PMDs? When UL2722-certified e-scooters coming into effect next July, at least 80,000 PMDs will be disposed of in the coming year. Can the Minister give some guidance on these areas? How will this be done?Domestic helpers and foreign workers play a big role at home and at work when it comes to waste management. What is the Ministry doing to reach out to these groups? Sir, in Chinese, please.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Everyone has a duty to protect the Earth. The Bill stipulates that large companies must inform authorities how much single-use packaging they are using and how to reduce packaging. We must treat this matter seriously. But at the same time we must also be aware of price increases brought about by the new regulations.The Bill also stipulates that food waste must be processed in a special machine. May I ask whether we are prepared for this change and how hawker centres, schools and military camps are going to cope? How are they going to train tenants of a building? We do not want it to be like our HDB recycling bins where just one person can contaminate the whole bin, causing all items inside to become unrecyclable.Separately, will the new regulations affect food prices?Talking about recycling in the HDB precincts, how will the new regulations affect the \"karang gunis (rag and bone men)\". Will they lose their trade entirely?There are many people who are about to change their PMDs to the ones that comply with the UL2272 standard. May I ask how to dispose of these PMDs correctly?Whether it is at commercial premises or at home, foreign workers and domestic helpers play a big role in waste management. Do we have plans to educate them on these new regulations?(In English): We will continue to push on with more efforts to promote sustainability.3.03 pmMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with climate change and sustainability increasingly a hot-button issue across the globe, it is timely to think about how we manage our waste as we set about building a sustainable Singapore.The amount of solid waste disposed has increased exponentially due to our affluence, population growth and consumption habits. Singapore's only landfill, Semakau Landfill, is expected to reach capacity in just 16 years if we continue to generate waste at current rates. This is a ticking time bomb that needs urgency in tackling. I am, therefore, heartened to see efforts being dedicated towards that end.The Resource Sustainability Bill we have before us is a timely addition to Singapore's waste management strategy by targeting the three main streams of waste in Singapore: electrical or electronic products and e-waste, food waste and packaging, and I support the Bill's aims to augment our waste management strategies. However, I would like to touch on a few topics related to circularity and resource sustainability, and I hope the Minister can clarify on how they will be addressed moving forward.One, packaging reporting. There has been much coverage over the impact of packaging waste over our environment. However, our reliance on such single-use packaging has only continued to deepen despite efforts, such as the voluntary Singapore Packaging Agreement. A main source of such packaging waste is made from plastic and, looking at the statistics over time, plastic waste disposed has gone way up from 540,800 tonnes in 2003 to 908,600 tonnes in 2018. As such, this House has unsurprisingly seen much debate over single-use plastics, including those used for packaging. However, data on the detailed use of such packaging does not seem to be tracked for now.Therefore, mandatory packaging reporting seems necessary as a first step towards a framework to regulate packaging products. And such is the case under Part 4 of the Bill. Under clause 20 of the Bill, companies are required to submit a report relating to the specified packaging provided that they fulfil the prescribed threshold criteria. While it is not clear in the Bill itself, the Zero Waste Masterplan notes that the problem is on excessive packaging, and the initial aim of the framework is at producers of packaged products and supermarkets with a turnover of more than $10 million. This is a start, but I do have some concerns.Singapore currently serves as a key market and a regional showcase for many companies and franchisees, be it home-grown brands or foreign brands. The packaging waste generated by many such companies can be substantial, including companies or businesses with not more than a turnover of $10 million.Can I ask the Senior Minister of State why a revenue threshold was chosen in the reporting standard? The concern here is that by focusing on the bigger players, we may be losing sight of the SMEs or the smaller businesses who may be used to single-use plastics as they have no resources to work on alternatives. How will the Ministry help businesses below that turnover threshold limit their packaging, especially businesses that have always used much packaging, for example, food and other retail businesses?This issue is important to get right, especially for currently small but fast growing companies, such as Grain and Wok Hey. Helping them with packaging standards at first will be morecost-effective than to have them switch over and comply with new standards at a later date.Furthermore, since producers of specified packaging who fulfil the prescribed threshold criteria in any year – let us call it \"T\" – must, in year T+2, submit to NEA a report relating to the specified packaging that is imported or used in year T+1, it appears that there will be a two-year time lag in calculating the total amount of packaging reported. Therefore, the earliest this information will be reported will be in 2021, as noted in the news. In the meantime, how will NEA work to ensure that between now and 2021, the companies will actively work towards less packaging? Has there been any companies that have given information to the relevant agencies on this? Will this data be made public?A clear benefit of releasing such data is to let relevant organisations use it for a Green Score system that allows companies to be judged on their efforts and targets to reduce packaging waste. This can incentivise companies to work towards reduction targets as an interim measure until NEA releases an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme for packaging companies.Two, treatment of food waste. Mr Deputy Speaker, food waste looks to be acostly and big problem that we have yet to find an effective way to handle. The Singapore Environment Council indicated in a recent study that food loss contributes to an estimated $2.54 billion from farm to market within Singapore. Key waste statistics from NEA indicate that while food waste stands at 10% of all waste generated, recycling stands at 17% of the food waste generated in 2018. It is an improvement from 6% in 2003 but, evidently, more can be done to tackle the remaining waste.However, our campaign against food waste seems lacklustre. The year-long Food Waste campaign is non-binding on citizens. In many Government and university events, anecdotes of good catered food going to waste as they are left unconsumed are a dime a dozen. Even as we must balance the needs between hygiene and waste management, the fact remains that food waste is a fundamental issue that requires bigger changes, indeed, an overhaul, to ensure that the loop can be closed and allow for effective regeneration of such resources.In the news, there are reports of plans from PUB to treat food waste into biogas at Tuas Nexus and of urban insect farms supported by Enterprise Singapore that are targeted at the food waste issue as well. Such grandiose plans, however, will take time to integrate.In the meantime, perhaps making consumption adjustments on major waste producers will see more immediate impact. As clause 4 of the Bill binds the Government on the provisions of the Bill, we could start from the Public Service to signal the seriousness that this Government takes in tackling a fundamental issue. How would the Public Service support efforts to reduce food waste internally? I have seen in a Straits Times Forum reply that SAF tries to keep food waste to a minimum. This could be extended to the whole of the Public Service, with a firm public commitment to lead by example and reduce food waste that it produces. This will send a good signal to the private sector and can even be a good way to reduce overheads in holding events, however slight.Also, under the Bill, occupiers of a prescribed building or part of a prescribed building must segregate food waste. In addition to food waste segregation facilities, building managers of a new building must also provide treatment facilities. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State what the expected use of food waste from new buildings will be, and if there will be enough off-takers of food waste slurry or compost.Finally, how is the Ministry currently helping charities that collect food from shops or food outlets and deliver it to needy residents and, if so, perhaps the Senior Minister of State can share with us what are these efforts and whether more support can be extended to these charities as this would help support the food waste and packaging waste goals and such charities play an important role in helping us to achieve these goals.Three, e-waste collection by individuals. Next, with the proliferation of digital devices, e-waste is increasingly a problem. Many households keep devices that no longer work, not knowing where to dispose of them. I am, therefore, concerned about how certain provisions in the Bill may adversely hinder certain current e-waste collection efforts.Under the provisions of the Bill, public collection of e-waste will henceforth be prohibited unless they are operating a licensed scheme or have a written approval of NEA to do so. Any person who does so will be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding S$5,000. Would these provisions within this Bill negatively affect well-intended public collection? How about the \"karang guni\" men who also provide collection services? I am of the view that NEA should encourage ground-up initiatives from members of the public, NGOs and small shops to enable such recycling in conjunction with industry stakeholders. Therefore, I hope that such written permission from NEA will be easy to obtain at little to nocost if they are doing such public collection with good intentions.I would also like to ask the Senior Minister of State how does the Ministry intend to enforce against retailers when they fall foul of the provisions of the Bill after it is passed and what recourse would the public have if retailers refuse to accept e-waste. What recourse can the public take to effectively report errant behaviour on the part of such retailers?It was noted that by the Senior Minister of State inCOS2018 that through aggregating e-waste and enabling more efficient collection and processing, there would be greater value captured from e-waste and can help offset thecost of operating the e-waste management system. As the small but burgeoning e-waste recycling industry will be boosted by the introduction of this framework, I hope some insights and assurances can be given on regulating precious metal recovery from e-waste. At this point, how do we ensure that the export of our e-waste for recycling purposes, such that the Basel Convention is compiled with, and that the e-waste do not end up in a black market overseas? Given the potentially hazardous chemicals involved in recycling, what safety regulations are in place to ensure that such chemicals do not find themselves into the environment?A case in point is Singapore-based Virogreen who had their import licence suspended for a year by Thailand’s Department of Industrial Works after police investigations. This was due to a batch of cargo with 96 tonnes of e-waste that was labelled as second-hand electronic appliances from countries, including Singapore, which found its way, according to Thai media reports, into their e-waste management plants.Such news is disconcerting, as such waste exports have been a source of diplomatic tensions and we do not want to impact the environment of our neighbours adversely. Ministerial reassurances in this area will go some way to assuage concerns on the impact on our environment or that we may be exporting our e-waste problem away, to the detriment of our neighbours.Four, marine pollution. Tackling the main streams of waste is key to minimise marine pollution that has impacted not just our shorelines, but also the shorelines and waterways of our neighbours. I wish to add my voice to support the recent Bangkok Declaration on combating Marine Debris that Singapore has adopted, but I hope we can do more on the preventative end.A key source of marine pollution has been micro plastics. Singapore has not been immune from this source of pollution, with micro plastics in our own coastline found to be carrying toxic pathogens that cause coral bleaching and wound infections. To prevent more of such micro plastics from entering the environment and wrecking damage, I wish to ask the Senior Minister of State if she will consider a ban on primary micro plastic production and use. Such bans have been introduced in the European Union, to be enforced from 2020.I believe that banning the production of micro plastics will send a good signal in our commitment to reduce the impact of micro plastics on our environment.Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in closing, I look forward to the Senior Minister of State's clarifications and answers, and notwithstanding my concerns, I support this Bill.3.15 pmMr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah): Sir, Singapore is facing a problem with waste. When something is thrown away, it does not disappear – it has to be disposed of somewhere or somehow. After reducing the volume of unrecycled waste through burning which produces energy, we need to put the remaining ashes somewhere. Landfills serve this purpose but, as the name connotes, it fills land and land is not something we have in abundance.We need to be good stewards of it – we cannot waste it. We have already used up substantial areas in Choa Chu Kang, Lim Chu Kang and Lorong Halus as landfills. Pulau Semakau is currently a key landfill and we cannot afford to waste it. The current 157-hectare plot that we are using in Pulau Semakau can hold approximately 6,680 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of ash. Last year, before incineration which reduces the volume by about 90%, we generated 15,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools of waste. Over the past 40 years, the amount of waste increased seven-fold, with food waste increasing 30% in the last 10 years. In fact, the current projected lifespan of Pulau Semakau is 2035 – 10 years earlier from previous estimates and only about 16 years from now. What we are aiming for is to prolong this for as long as possible. This Bill supports the endeavour by addressing electrical and electronic waste, packaging waste and food waste.Part 3 of this Bill addresses electrical and electronic waste. It makes sure users have a way to recycle these products. Clause 13 requires producers of non-consumer products to collect upon request what was produced or manufactured.Clause 15 requires large retailers to accept used products similar to those they sell in order to dispose of them.Clause 14 requires retailers who deliver products to accept and dispose the old item. This would be especially useful for bulky electric products such as washing machines and fridges. Not only would this reduce the toxicity of waste going to our landfill, it will also be able to extract valuable minerals and materials from these used products, finding treasure in the trash. This will reduce the demand on mining and make these limited resources on the earth last longer.In essence, we have a duty in Parliament to ensure we entrench a sustainable plan to protect our green environment, reduce plastic-usage, increase recycling, enhance upcycling. If done correctly, Singapore can be a global thought leader on this. It must be a united effort across all sectors of our society.Collection is the first step and there is a need to encourage and promote collection. This is done by requiring operators of the responsible producer scheme to hit a target collection in clause 30(c) and by requiring them to promote awareness of electronic waste disposal in clause 30(d).After collection, the waste needs to be dealt with properly. clause 12 requires producers to manage electric waste by becoming a member of a responsible producer scheme, which is regulated by Part 6 of the Bill. Furthermore, clause 17 makes it an offence for non-individuals to dispose regulated products as waste instead of through the licensed producer responsibility scheme, licensed waste collector or licensed e-waste recycler, or someone approved to collect e-waste. Even as the consequences are quite serious for non-compliance, would the Minister explain how will they work with and assist those arrested and affected understand how to comply with this legislation?Furthermore, as this Bill addresses regulated products, would the Minister explain how this might affect e-commerce of electronic products and how are concerns that those required to accept or collect waste might become inequitably burdened by waste that they were not responsible for producing; that is, how are these concerns going to be addressed?Besides electronic waste, another important source of waste that this Bill seeks to address is packaging waste. Part 4 institutes a reporting regime relating to packaging which requires producers of specified packaging to monitor its packaging waste and to think about ways to reduce, reuse or recycle packaging. These reports are to be submitted according to the years that the producers hit the prescribed limit.The flexibility in such a scheme is good. It encourages producers to be aware of what they are producing, why they are producing it and how they can reduce it. Yet, on the other hand, producers figure out for themselves how to get to the end goal of reducing packaging waste, allowing them to prioritise what they are looking for in packaging, accommodating the variety of purposes packaging may serve for that product. For instance, drink powder sachets apportion the powder, make it portable, differentiate sachet contents and protects it from getting wet. Yet, on the other hand, more environmentally-friendly packaging such as paper-based packaging may serve similar functions instead.Relating to recycling packaging, I have three questions. Firstly, does biodegradable plastic help our landfill problem or are they treated the same way as non-biodegradable plastic. If so, is it feasible to tweak our waste management system to better tap into the biodegradable ability of these biodegradable plastics? Second, what plans are there to increase our capability to recycle our own waste product, especially plastic waste. This is especially important since there are reports that recyclable waste is ending up incinerated. Thirdly, because trash can be treasures for a different product, how can Singapore tap into upcycling our waste and promoting a circular economy even though Singapore may not have a very big manufacturing sector ourselves?The third kind of waste this Bill addresses is in Part 5, being food waste. Clause 26 requires building managers of certain kinds of buildings to provide their own food waste management facility within the premises. If that building is an existing building, clause 27(2) allows the food waste management process to be outsourced instead of being situated onsite but the food must still be segregated and treated. Although the building manager needs to provide such a facility, the duty is not left to the building's management alone. An occupier is compelled to make use of it through clause 25 which creates an offence for an occupier of such buildings to dispose food waste together with other types of waste if the food waste was generated in that building.While compelled by law to manage food waste, processing food waste on-site may actually savecost for management. This is what happened in Our Tampines Hub (OTH) where only one garbage compactor truck is needed daily, compared to three previously, saving the management about $40,000 annually. Because food was not left exposed overnight, pest and rodent problems are minimised. Food compost are used as fertilisers and non-potable water used for cleaning the eco-digester, rubbish bins or bin centres.Would the Ministry kindly elaborate on who are the intended prescribed buildings? Would they include shopping malls and hawker centres? Additionally, since there is great benefit in composting food waste, does the Ministry have plans to extend food waste management systems to residential estates or make such food waste management facilities accessible to non-occupants of the prescribed building?Besides dealing with food waste through a food waste management system, there is a need to minimise food contaminating recyclable items. Perhaps the Ministry could consider requiring regular dustbins be situated near recycling bins so that the inconsiderate actions of a few will not hamper the recycling efforts of the majority. What is being done to increase recycling literacy and how effective has it been?Sir, in conclusion, while we increase efforts to reduce packaging and recycle food and electronic waste, what we need is renewed mindsets. For example, is the measure of unusability whether something is old and faded rather than spoilt and inoperable? Instead of reusing old mindsets, maybe we should discard them to have new ones – new ones that help us be content with what we have; new ones that help us prioritise responsible disposal over personal convenience; new ones that promote conscientious stewardship of our landfill over more short-sighted enjoyment of the temporal, without caring about the future. We need to change the way we conceptualise, handle and create waste. This Bill provides the important infrastructural support for that change, and therefore, I support it.3.26 pmAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, alarm bells have been ringing around the world about the Climate Emergency facing our planet. The Prime Minister addressed the Climate Emergency in his National Day Rally speech recently. Even before this Climate Emergency, Singapore has been facing a Waste Emergency for decades now. Already, our only landfill at Pulau Semakau had its lifespan shortened from 2045 to 2035. We only have 15-odd years left to solve this problem.We knew about this emergency for a while and yet our responses have not been as strong as they should be. In laying the framework to compel producers of e-waste, packaging waste and food waste to reduce, reuse and recycle their waste, this Bill is good though late in coming.There is a lot of discussion about the circular economy approach to addressing the problematic waste streams. The Zero Waste Master Plan is supposed to express the circular economy aspiration, to eliminate waste and to continually reuse resources in the production-consumption cycle. The target announced is to reduce the daily waste sent to Semakau by 30% by 2030.Is this ambitious enough for the Waste Emergency we are facing? How much will this slow down the filling up of Pulau Semakau and extend its lifespan? What happens when Semakau is filled up eventually? Why not up the ante to halving the daily waste by 2030?In addition to these general questions, I would like to discuss three aspects that I think are being neglected by the framework to be instituted by this Bill.The first is that the treatment of the three waste streams does not address the issue of transnational waste cycles.The second is that the treatment of the food waste stream is too focused on the waste itself and neglects the upstream causes of food waste, including the way we eat.The third is that our public education approach is still stuck in the communication campaign model and neglects the more effective model of targeting problem areas smartly by social nudging.The first issue is transnational waste streams. With regard to e-waste, the current framework targets producers of electronic and electrical goods with retail presence here in Singapore and also retail companies selling these goods. This is still based on the brick-and-mortar economy.However, the trend is for consumers to order their electronic goods online. And it is not uncommon for small to medium-sized goods to be shipped from overseas these days through micro-retailers utilising online platforms to connect with consumers. How would the Extended Producer Responsibility framework apply to these micro-retailers and overseas producers? How would the e-waste from these production-consumption streams be audited and factored into the EPR system? These are not trivial questions as we should expect online shopping and transnational delivery to increase in scope and scale as technologies improve and society evolves.The same applies to packaging waste. Online shopping and transnational delivery mean more packaging would be used to ensure goods are not damaged by extended shipping. The current framework targets producers of packaging and packaged produces with annual turnover of more than $10 million.What percentage of packaging waste do these producers account for? Does this cover the growing online shopping arms of these producers? How about the growing field of micro-retailers and overseas producers selling to local consumers through online platforms?The other major problem is the fact that we export 30% of our recyclable waste to countries including Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand for processing. Some of these countries are closing their doors to waste import, while there have been cases of waste dumping and e-waste pollution hurting local communities that give a bad name to countries that export waste like Singapore.How can we ensure that our exported recyclable wastes are properly processed and recycled? What happens if we are not able to export the waste for recycling, for example plastic and packaging wastes, do we just incinerate them?This is not just an accountability issue, but it is also about the integrity of the circular economy approach. If we are not ensuring waste materials get returned to the production-consumption cycle, but are simply trying to get rid of thrash to prevent Semakau from filling up, then we are not keeping to the true spirit of the circular economy.Food waste also has a transnational dimension. The recent study by the Singapore Environment Council shows that one-fifth of total food in Singapore, over 390,000 tonnes of fresh produce, is wasted in the food supply chain. A significant portion, 144,000 tonnes are lost when imported food lands in Singapore. Why is this so and what can MEWR do to reduce this unnecessary wastage?The second issue is that we need to go upstream to tackle the food waste, from tackling wastage in the food supply chain to the way the nation eats. We should deploy the circular economy approach here too in a whole-of-system manner.I mentioned the significant amount of food lost in the importing food chain. One solution is to increase local production to supply food. To this end, the Government is targeting to increase local production to meet 30% of local nutritional needs by 2030. Increasing local food production will create other problems of food lost and wasted during the production process. MEWR should therefore look at this area and encourage the reusing of food lost during the production process as animal feed or their recycling into compost for farming.The large-scale processing of food waste will also reap benefits. I understand that when the Tuas Nexus comes online in 2025, food waste and used water sludge will be co-digested to produce biogas for energy production. Does this mean the trade-off is that we will not be benefitting from composting food waste instead? Are the options for food waste treatment either co-digestion to product biogas or composting to produce fertiliser? If so, what are the calculations of MEWR in choosing co-digestion rather than composting, since the production of compost fertiliser could benefit local farming?The current Bill targets commercial and industrial premises that generate large amounts of food waste to undertake food waste segregation for treatment. But given that half of the total food waste generated comes from residential households, should we not require the same undertaking for residential premises?I understand from Minister Masagos' reply to my Parliamentary Question last month that a household food waste segregation pilot was conducted at Tampines GreenLace and the results were very promising, with 4,000 kg of food waste collected over three months. Residents even requested for the pilot to be extended. Given the success and the popularity of the pilot, and the fact that we are facing a waste emergency, should we not be bold and extend this now to all HDB estates?The way we Singaporeans eat matter. We import 90% of our food and yet we consume in abundance with very little awareness of our food security issues. A lot of wastage is caused by near-expiry food being thrown away by both retailers and consumers. Yet, we have a not insignificant group of Singaporeans facing household food insecurity.We need to encourage food donation to reduce food waste. I have spoken on this before, during the debate on the Singapore Food Agency Bill, the Government is in a good position to develop a National Food Support System to channel excess food to fight household food insecurity in Singapore and feed hungry Singaporeans. We should also legislate Good Samaritan laws to protect food donors and food distributors from criminal or civil liability for incidents arising from donated excess food.The third issue is we have hit a green ceiling on education. We need to change our model from communication campaigns to strong and smart nudging using the social norms held by Singaporeans. Domestic recycling rates have remained stuck at 21%. The response by MEWR is to change the labels on the blue bins and paint the recycling trucks blue. We need to do better.If we would identify a social norm that is blocking efforts to encourage domestic recycling and raising green consciousness across Singapore society, it is the norm of convenience. Convenience has become the norm that need no explanation when it comes to demand for Government and municipal services. To reduce littering, we make throwing rubbish convenient by placing green rubbish bins all over the city. To promote a hygienic environment, we make garbage disposal convenient by building rubbish chutes in each home or on each floor. Using the same reason or excuse, we refuse to consider banning or discouraging plastic bag usage, so that residents can conveniently bag their garbage to dispose.Whenever a slight inconvenience is caused by maintenance or repair works, we apologise for it. That is why the blue recycling bin has hit a green ceiling, because the big bin conveniently placed at the foot of the block by the side of the road is a convenient bin to dump any rubbish indiscriminately. At the larger systemic level, we conveniently incinerate our rubbish when we can. We need to change this mindset of convenience. A true circular economy cannot have convenience as the dominant norm guiding our behaviour.This is why I think the Government is mistaken in its reluctance to tackle single-use plastics as such despite the strong public calls to do it. It is not a populist move with little systemic impact. Yes, tackling single-use plastics will not have as much impact on reducing the waste streams filling up Semakau than the complex EPR systems being put in place. But it has tremendous educational value that will nudge Singaporeans to change their whole approach to consumption and disposal of waste.Single-use plastics represent the epitome of convenience. For example, single-use plastic water bottles, instead of drinking from a cup that has to be filled and washed, one just has to open, drink and throw. When we tackle single-use plastics, we are not just tackling the plastic, we are challenging the idea of convenience and undermining its importance.We do not have to ban plastic bags to do this. We need to nudge smartly. In some cities, authorities have mandated households to purchase and only use government-certified garbage bags for the disposal of thrash. This nudges citizens to think less of convenience and more of thecost of convenience and leads to overall reduction in the use of plastic bags.We could also consider nudging household food waste segregation by mandating the use of Government-certified food waste bags with printed diagrams of what would be considered food waste.Likewise, I remember the early days of our National Recycling Programme, when green translucent recycling bags were dropped at the doors of each household. On each bag, there were diagrams showing what items can be recycled and what cannot. The recycling bags were inconvenient, because it required residents to place items into the bag and bring it out to the lift lobby on a specified date every fortnight. It was also inconvenient as a system, because workers needed to go to each floor to collect the bags and bring them down to the truck.But it gave those who would try to recycle purpose and a sense of achievement, and the green bags at home reminded everyone to recycle. Moreover, residents were encouraged and nudged when they can visibly see their neighbour recycle, bumping into the green bags of recyclables at the lift lobby on collection days. Neighbours can even gently correct recycling mistakes, since the bag was translucent. It promoted recycling as social behaviour and collective action, which is always more effective than to try to change individual behaviour.Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are very far from our Zero Waste aspiration. The circular economy approach is the right one to adopt. The focus on e-waste, packaging waste and food waste is also a correct focus.However, we need to pay attention to the growing transnational dimension of our waste streams to ensure our efforts do not go to waste. We also need to go more upstream to tackle the problem of food waste, reducing loss in the food supply chain and recycling food waste for compost to improve local food production. Lastly, we need to double down on education and get all Singaporeans to reduce, reuse and recycle as their second nature. We should do this by moving away from communication campaigns to social nudging, especially to shake up the norm of convenience at the heart of our problems.This is not just about Semakau filling up, but it is also about how we see ourselves as citizens of this Earth, whether we should seek our own selfish convenience or to choose to protect Earth for the sake of our children. I support the Bill.3.39 pmMs Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill for this is critically necessary for the Zero Waste Masterplan to have any bite. This Masterplan has been eagerly anticipated by the community and was ceremoniously launched last Friday. In fact, I think even the Ministry was eager to get this going that the Bill was referred to as the Act in the Masterplan on the website when I checked in after the launch. I thank Senior Minister of State Amy Khor for taking my feedback on that misunderstanding which has now been updated on the website and the Masterplan.The Bill’s intent is to fortify the regulatory teeth needed to ensure sustainability in the consumption of resources, which our planet has a finite amount of. However, the Bill can and must do much more to reflect the urgency of the climate crisis which I would like to discuss. I would also like to take this opportunity with the Bill to urge the Government to take a bold and different perspective in solving food security challenge for our vulnerable groups as a critical climate change action.Mr Deputy Speaker, we are not short of daily reminders that \"yesterday would have been better\" for taking actions against human-caused climate change. The United Nations International Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, had warned in October 2018 that we only have 12 years, or 11 years now, for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5 degrees celsius in order to limit climate change catastrophe per the Paris Agreement which we are a party of.Closer to home, our waste generation has not reduced substantially at all. We generated 7.7 million tonnes of solid waste in 2018, only a 9,000 tonne or a dismal 0.1% decrease from the previous year. In 2018, we generated 763,100 tonnes of food waste, accounting for 10% of our total waste.  At this rate, our landfill will run out of space in 2035.Time is not on our side. Please allow me to propose further measures that must be implemented to signal the urgency.First, Mr Deputy Speaker, smart targets and goals. Having companies simply report on their plans to reduce, reuse or recycle products in the Bill is insufficient. Reporting obligations have no bite if it is not accompanied by waste production limits and recycling targets for producers. We must set SMART goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound so the producers can plan and prepare accordingly.For example, the European Union Packaging Directive 2018 sets that by 2025, 65% by weight of all packaging must be recycled, with specific recycling targets for each material, such as 50% for plastic and 75% for paper and cardboard. By 2030, the target for recycled packaging is increased to 70%, including 55% for plastic and 85% of paper and cardboard.Such reduction targets can be achieved with ingenuity. In 2018, Unilever launched a 3-litre bottle for their Omo laundry detergent brand in Brazil, with a formula at six times the concentration of the original, so it can be diluted in people’s homes. This has reduced the volume of plastic used by 75%. Companies must also inform customers about maintenance and repair services, environmental impacts and materials. Retailers should also actively inform customers of sustainable products. We can emulate the ambitious target setting and look to have companies report their progress on waste minimisation year-on-year via a measure of waste per unit of product output.Second, we must encourage public accountability and corporate stewardship by mandating these reports to be made public. Currently, the Singapore Exchange listing rules already has sustainability reporting guidelines but with no specific metrics prescribed. If we would like to see resource sustainability as a core part of doing business, it would seem sensible to stipulate the targets above as a standard reporting requirement for all listed companies. I understand that the Hong Kong Stock Exchange had a recent consultation on ESG reporting to one, \"require disclosure of significant climate-related issues\" and two, amend the \"Environmental\" key performance indicators to require disclosure of relevant targets.Third, to escalate the adoption of sustainability mindset and ensure affordability, we could incentivise producers and retailers with tax rebates, so that these obligations do not merely end in increasedcosts for reporting and collection, and the possibility of penalty – all of which will ultimately be passed on to the consumers. In China and Thailand, the EPR schemes introduced subjected companies producing non-biodegradable goods to taxes and offered tax credits as incentives for companies that used waste as raw materials.Finally, if we want to reduce our resource footprint, we need to broaden the notion of sustainability. Singapore's Earth Overshoot Day for 2019 was 12 April 2019. This means that if the world consumed like us, we would be consuming three times as much resources as the earth can regenerate in a given year.If we were to drive true resource sustainability we not only have to compel producers to reduce packaging, and have mandatory take-back programmes, we need electronics producers and retailers to be truly incentivised to extend product lifetimes, ensure maintenance and repair services availability. This is an area where legislation is fast moving in the EU. For example, in France, planned obsolescence of an electronic product is a criminal offence. There are also on-going discussions in the EU that expected product lifetime be labelled.Mr Deputy Speaker, as we discuss these measures to address the climate crisis, we must not miss the tremendous opportunity to reduce and redistribute the phenomenal 763,100 tonnes of food waste generated every year can provide for a more climate-just outcome for the 400,000 food-insecure people in Singapore. Let me caveat this number as an estimate deliberation from the 2017/2018 household expenditure survey.Let me illustrate why I think this is a tremendous opportunity and that the Zero Waster Masterplan must not be looked at in solo from the social challenges we have. Of the 763,000 tonnes of food loss a year, let us assume conservatively that half of them, or 382,000 tonnes, can be salvaged and redistributed. One meal, conservatively, uses 1 kg and, therefore, we will get about 382 million meals from the redistributable food loss. Each person eats 1,095 daily meals a year, which is to say, we can safely feed about 390,000 people a year. That means, Mr Deputy Speaker, this food loss every year could provide food security for all our vulnerable groups! I shared this in my speech during the debate on the Singapore Food Agency Bill as well. I know this is a simple calculation but I think we get the point.Prime Minister Lee sounded a clarion call for Singapore to recognise the threat that climate change poses to us. We must never forget that for most of the world, Singapore included, the most vulnerable amongst us will be hit hardest. Climate change is already affecting rice production in the Mekong Delta. As temperature rises changes agriculture productivity and sea level rises, food availability will inevitably be affected. For the 400,000 food-insecure people in Singapore, any price increase is detrimental.SG Food Rescue is a small group of individuals, and they have demonstrated that there is much in our food value chain that can be saved and redistributed. Its volunteers collect a staggering 1,500 kg of unsold fresh produce once a week from Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre. Sometimes, they collect twice a week for a total of 2,500 kg of unsold fresh produce. Five hundred to 700 kg of that goes to charities, namely, Free Food For All, Beyond Social Services and St Theresa's Home that feed the needy, while the rest is sent to a soup kitchen in Little India, Krishna's Kitchen. The soup kitchen processes the vegetables and turns them into meals to feed the hungry, especially migrant workers in the Little India area. About 200 kg ends up with a community initiative in Marine Terrace – just down the road from where I live – and one of the six public community fridges, benefiting low-income residents.And we can do even more, and we need to do so urgently and systemically. We can shape food-loss-reducing behaviours by changing our food labelling policies and also enacting the Good Samaritan laws. In Singapore, \"use by\", \"sell by\", \"expiry date\" and \"best before\" all mean expiry date, according to the Singapore Food Agency. Products are not allowed to be sold or distributed in Singapore past that date. This is, therefore, a huge source of food waste.In many jurisdictions, including United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand, \"use by\", \"best before\" and \"sell by\" mean that after the food reaches its \"use by\" date, the quality and flavour of the food is lowered, but it could still be edible. Studies found that when a link between date labels, food waste and its environmental impacts is made, the willingness-to-pay for expired food increases, particularly for expired frozen or recently expired semi-perishable products.Food that has gone past its \"best before\" date can be donated to charities so long as its within six months of the \"best before\" date. I am pleased to note that the Singapore Food Agency is exploring Good Samaritan laws to ease business concerns over the donation of excess food. I strongly advocate for the implementation of such laws which have been implemented in countries such as Italy and the United States, and have encouraged food donations and reduced food waste.As I mentioned before, incentives to help drive corporate behaviours cannot be overlooked. We could consider extending the underused Business-IPC Partnership Scheme or BIPs to include donation of edible food that would otherwise go to waste to charities. When supported by the Good Samaritan laws, this is especially compelling for many businesses I know, like Samsui Supplies and Services, through the Company of Good, a corporate giving initiative by the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre.Mr Deputy Speaker, not only will such measures truly drive food resource sustainability, we could be relieving our financially strapped households of a huge burden. Based on the Report on the Household Expenditure Survey 2017/2018, comparing the expenditures on food and income, excluding CPF, of our lowest quintile Singaporeans, 49% of their income is spent on food.Mdm Gopal, in her 70s, who lives in Toa Payoh, is one of them. She has zero income and survives on $500 per month from her SSO. As a beneficiary of Free Food For All, a charity that receives and redistributes donated food, she saves a minimum of $100 per month. Larger families are able to save much more.We would also be freeing up scarce resources dedicated to our social safety net for other essential needs such as healthcare. Based on our estimates on how much itcosts for programmes like Meals-on-Wheels and Willing Hearts, that provide more than 10,000 daily meals in total, close to $15 million could be redirected to other aspects of social support, especially as higher standards of living with higher temperatures mean that the basic needs of even our most vulnerable must also be constantly reviewed.Mr Deputy Speaker, engaging the business community must be a top priority because sustainability is a future investment for economic growth, new market opportunities and job creation. Companies must be nudged out of their comfort zones into a greener and more innovative direction as we work towards building a circular economy. This Bill, and the Zero Waste Masterplan, is a step in the right direction but it is not enough, not with the fierce urgency of the climate crisis, and rightful ambition that we must have to be a leader in climate change mitigation.And more than that, sustainability is also a social parameter to secure a more inclusive society. As urgent as addressing the looming threats of climate change by reducing significant food loss, is the need to solve the food insecurity problem of so many fellow Singaporeans by redistributing this food loss. If a small group of citizen volunteers like SG Food Rescue can move hundreds of tonnes of food loss every year to where they are needed most, imagine what we can do if we – Government, business and community – truly commit our will and resources to a national vision of getting all 400,000 people fed, and make climate change everyone's concern? I believe we can do this.Mr Deputy Speaker: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.20 pm.Sitting accordingly suspendedat 3.55 pm until 4.20 pm.Sitting resumed at 4.20 pm[Deputy Speaker (Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]Resource Sustainability BillDebate resumed.Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,Singapore has had a long-standing commitment to sustainability. In fact, our journey towards sustainability started in the 1960s, when our late Mr Lee Kuan Yew laid down the foundations for a clean and green Singapore, even before it was trendy to be green. Even as we grappled with a fledgling economy and uncertain times, we consciously moved towards cleaner sources of energy, dedicated our resources to cleaning up our major waterways, as well as growing our Garden City. We must continue this legacy.Sustainability is anchored in our ability to identify solutions that creatively minimise the trade-offs we have to make. And yet, allow us to achieve longer term goals in multiple domains. In Singapore, it is a commitment to balanced growth that benefits both the current and future generations, as well as a commitment to creating a high-quality living environment. Often, such sustainability solutions require that we are able to see different, seemingly disjointed parts of our economy and society function as part of an integrated, inter-connected ecosystem. Therefore, changes to the law to better manage how Singapore handles waste, and to help businesses that reduce and recycle electronic waste, packaging waste and food leftovers are a good first step.Singapore is particularly vulnerable to global disruptions caused by climate change. The Amazon–a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming–has seen more than 80,000 fires break out so far this year. It is a 77% rise, compared to the same period in 2018. A change in weather patterns likely contributed to this. Urgent action is, therefore, needed.While we cannot solve the Amazon problem, we can and still must play our part here in Singapore. The Resource Sustainability Bill is a good attempt to create a long-term solution to complement individual efforts in the 3Rs by placing more responsibility on businesses and producers in the supply chain to reduce, reuse and recycle. This aim is also in line with the Government’s international obligations and reflects our support for the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals which were adopted in 2015.The Bill could also positively impact workers in providing new avenues for job creation. For example, more jobs would be created in supply chain management; or specialist fields, for instance, innovation and engineering in streamlining waste disposal, recycling processes and optimising packaging designs of products.The next generation of our younger Singaporeans entering the workforce will also have very exciting opportunities to play an integral part in the national effort to mitigate the effects of climate change. The Labour Movement is currently working with tripartite partners to support our workers and young Singaporeans by ensuring skills acquisition training for new entrants and existing workers in the Environmental Services field.However, we note that this Bill could also affect businesses negatively through changes to existing jobs and companies' processes. In the short term, companies could face increased compliancecosts. This could be especially challenging in today’s global economy. This could potentially translate tocost-cutting measures felt by workers or consumers. In the longer term, companies may have to restructure their internal processes to reducecosts and promote innovation and sustainability.So, I would like to check with the Minister how will the Ministry support businesses and workers through these short-term and long-term changes. Specifically, should there be extensions and/or staggering of timelines to encourage compliance by companies and time for workers to adapt? Do we expect to provide time also for workers to take on the necessary training? We should aim to enable workers to keep their jobs while ensuring that this process continues. In addition, we also cannot leave our SMEs behind. Can more assistance be provided to the smaller one who might struggle to afford the resources for compliance? Could grants be provided to smaller companies to help them comply? The Labour Movement will support workers through this transition. It is prepared to work with the Ministry to help our workers and companies adapt to this change.I have some technical points of clarification that I would like to seek from the Minister.First, section 7(3) appears to exempt any manufacturer of regulated products from being considered as \"producers\" and, therefore, subject to registration and/or licensed scheme requirements, if the regulated product was manufactured “for or on behalf of” a \"Singapore-connected person\". Section 19(2) is similar in the context of the use of \"specified packaging\". What examples are envisaged by this exemption? How would we know whether a manufacturer of a regulated product would specifically be manufacturing the product “for or on behalf of a Singapore-connected person”?Are there estimates as to how many companies could feasibly take shelter under this exemption? On the face of it, it appears that many products supplied and manufactured in Singapore would generally be manufactured for or on behalf of Singapore-connected persons, that is, Singapore citizens/PRs or companies with a Singapore connection.Furthermore, section 12(1)/(2) and section 20(1) make reference to the thresholds which the Minister may prescribe for regulated consumer products and packaging respectively. Can we have clarification on how the \"prescribed threshold\" will be determined? What are the criteria and how will these be determined?As mentioned by the Prime Minister in his National Day Rally speech, whilst we may not be able to halt climate change by ourselves, we all need to do our part to contribute to the global effort. Let us continue to strive for sustainability, not only because of the world we wish our future generations to inherit, but because we believe we stand to reap the rewards for doing so in a very tangible way. The Singapore Story is testament to our belief that economic growth and sustainability are themselves not mutually exclusive but are instead mutually reinforcing and beneficial. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.4.27 pmDr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang): Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to declare my interest as the Vice-Chairman of the Singapore Environment Council. I rise in support of the Bill.Sir, Singapore is a small nation with limited land area and no natural resources. This has necessitated us to import resources in order for us to build up our infrastructure and built environment to allow for Singaporeans to live, work and play as they do today.Likewise, 90% of our food is imported from outside of Singapore. This is in addition to the natural gas and liquefied natural gas that we import to generate 95% of our electricity. In other words, we are heavily reliant on supplies that we import to survive. There should be no illusions that we can survive in isolation.Yet, we are victims of our own success. Our economic growth has caused Singaporeans to become affluent and we have developed a tendency to over consume. This over-consumption is not isolated to merely food but also other resources, such as electrical and electronic appliances. Statistics released by the Ministry places the amount of food waste per year at 763 million kg and the amount of e-waste per year at 60 million kg.Sir, climate change, an issue which Prime Minister Lee spoke on extensively at the recent National Day Rally, will pose threats to the supply of resources, such as reduction of harvest yields and disruptions to transportation. It is inevitable that these will affect Singaporeans, given our need to import resources. As such, all of us must play our part and make sustainability a way of life in Singapore.The Bill provides a good first step in encouraging the responsible consumption of resources and the proper disposal of e-waste and food waste among Singaporeans. It is also a good starting point in the creation of a sustainable eco-system to manage waste in Singapore.Sir, I would like to raise some questions relating to the Bill at this juncture.In relation to paragraph 15(1), it is stated that \"large retailers must offer in-store collection of certain e-waste\". With the proliferation of e-commerce, it is conceivable that e-retailers sell a comparable amount, if not more, in comparison to traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. How does the Ministry intend for these retailers to provide these physical collection points when they do not have any physical stores?In addition, the stipulations of paragraphs 14 and 15 are likely to cause large retailers of electrical and electronic appliances to incur additionalcosts. Has the Ministry studied how it can help to offset some of thesecosts?Sir, to help alleviate the burden on businesses, I would like to propose three measures.First, the Government should consider providing grants or tax breaks. These grants or tax breaks can be given when businesses invest in infrastructure to promote sustainable practices, such as the setting up of in-store collection points and waste recycling centres.Second, the Government can look into the possibility of renting industrial buildings to these retailers at subsidised prices if they are used for waste disposal processes, such as consolidation or sorting. We can learn from the state government of Victoria, Australia, which provides grants and funding for programmes contributing to sustainability, including infrastructure. In particular, one of the grants, known as the Resource Recovery Infrastructure Fund, aims to improve the collection, sorting and recycling of processed materials. It has allocated A$19.1 million since 2017. It has proven successful, with an estimated reduction in 900,000 tons of landfill waste per year. We can learn from the Victorian government in incentivising the creation of waste disposal infrastructure in our nation.Third, the Government should set up an online National Registry of Producers and Regulated Products. This will not only help businesses in reducingcosts associated with developing their own systems to monitor and track these products, but will also help the Government in aggregating data on a national scale. This will help it to identify ways in which schemes can be improved upon, and programmes introduced, in order to ramp up sustainability efforts.It is not sufficient to simply assign the responsibility to businesses. The contributions of businesses in efforts, such as carrying energy-efficient appliances, promoting the purchase of these, providing attractive trade-in deals to incentivise consumers to use energy-efficient products, and setting up more e-waste recycling points are bound to aid in sustainability. However, the pursuit of sustainability should be a collective effort by Singaporeans from all walks of life.There are drawbacks to imposing the bulk of responsibility on the retailers. First, this will result in rising business expenditures for the retailers. In turn, they will pass on these increasedcosts to consumers. This may disincentivise Singaporeans from procuring more energy-efficient appliances and keeping up with technological advancements. The former will definitely not support environmentalism, while the latter will create speed bumps in our drive to make Singapore a smart nation and a global tech hub.Sir, I wish to make three proposals as to how we can take the provisions of the Bill further and work towards Singaporeans coming together to reduce waste and engaging in measures beneficial for the environment.First, the Government should launch an education campaign aimed at educating businesses and consumers on how to properly dispose of various kinds of waste, including food and e-waste. The goal of this campaign is to ultimately ingrain sustainable practices into the subconscious of each and every Singaporean, in a similar fashion to how the proper separation of waste has become a given to most Japanese people. In addition, in relation to education pertaining to consumers and businesses, the Government should aim for the three following policy outcomes.One, for consumers and businesses to make every conscious effort to fight climate change and engage in sustainable practices, such as using energy-efficient appliances and purchasing the right amount of food.Two, for responsible consumption and proper disposal of waste to become second nature to consumers and businesses.Three, for consumers and businesses to encourage others to adhere to sustainable practices, through whistle-blowing or otherwise, and to prevent the indiscriminate disposal of waste.Second, the Government can provide tax breaks or grants to retailers who choose to engage in corporate social responsibility programmes, such as replacing the energy-inefficient appliances of low-income households with more energy-efficient models.Sir, air conditioners and refrigerators which are energy-inefficient consume a great amount of energy. Low-income households are unable, rather than unwilling, to replace these. It would be beneficial if the Government can provide tax breaks for these companies as their actions will help not just the environment, but also our less fortunate.Third, the Government can work with our supermarkets to ensure that food nearing expiry is not simply disposed of but is provided to the less well-off in Singapore.The French Government passed a law in 2016 mandating that large supermarkets have to donate excess food to food banks and charitable organisations. If we had a similar initiative in Singapore, we can not only reduce the amount of food waste, but can also help those in need. Struggling households will greatly benefit from receiving this food, while we make strides in cutting down on waste. I would like to propose that the Ministry study the possibility of enacting similar measures.Sir, in conclusion, while I stand wholly in support of the Bill, I believe that future legislation or initiatives should make more room for the inclusion of all those who reside in Singapore to contribute more to sustainability. I believe that the best solution to solving our issues pertaining to waste is to foster an environmentally-conscious society on all levels and across all sectors, in which the pursuit of reduced waste is a concept which is ingrained on a subconscious level in Singaporean businesses, people and Government.4.38 pmProf Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member): Mr Deputy Speaker, I declare my interest as Board Director of the Singapore Environment Council.In the face of scorching temperatures, environmental degradation and climate change, the Resource Sustainability Bill, an entirely new Bill to address these critical issues, is very welcome, indeed.We in Singapore have become well-acquainted with the 3Rs – reduce, reuse and recycle – perhaps to the point that they have become somewhat trite and lost valuable traction. In truth, although many of us try hard to practise these 3Rs, it seems like broader structural factors and norms work against our best efforts.Let me illustrate with one of my favourite Instagram accounts, that of Tabao Girl. This environmentally-minded young woman meticulously details the steps she takes daily to reduce her use of disposables. On most days, she succeeds remarkably with her inspiring arsenal of reusable cups, containers and cutlery, and enjoys her takeaway food like the rest of us.But one day in July this year, she recounted in a post her distressing experience at a bakery while waiting behind another customer. She said, \"When he was done paying, I was almost going to cry. First, the 13 buns, each in one plastic bag of its own. Then he wanted six buns in one bag and seven buns in another – and he wanted them double-bagged. Then he asked the cashier to give him one large bag to put everything into. In one bakery trip for 13 buns, there was a total of 18 – eighteen plastic bags – used in one single transaction.\"I share her distress when I witness such scenes in bakeries, hawker centres and supermarkets. It seems that, as consumers, we have become so precious that food items must be individually packed for fear that they come into contact with each other. Heaven forbid that we allow our floss buns to defile our chocolate croissants! Indeed, I often find it difficult to advise service staff that I do not wish to have my breads individually packed and that I have no need for disposable cutlery. Many look at me with annoyance, as if I have disrupted their well-established work processes.I do not fault these staff. The broader structural factors we all labour under are norms set in place by industries and consumer expectations which have been shaped as a result.Companies are keen to win over customers and see offering individual packaging and free bags as good service. Consumers are, in turn, trained to expect and demand such provisions and this vicious cycle perpetuates itself countless times every single day. Over time, such norms and expectations result in mountains of trash and ingrain in our people wasteful habits that generate more rubbish than we can handle. These harmful norms and expectations exist not only in F&B but in virtually every industry.I would, therefore, like to propose an alternative set of 3Rs that can take environmental sustainability at institutional and individual levels to a higher plane. In addition to reduce, reuse and recycle, therefore, I propose that we strive to reinvent, recalibrate and reward.The Resource Sustainability Act will be an excellent initiative with regard to reinvention. By requiring that those who profit from the supply of products be responsible for collecting and treating these products when they become waste, companies will be more cognizant of downstream effects of their commercial activity. Hence, this will motivate them to invest more heavily in reinventing their products so that waste generation is minimised.On the specific issue of e-waste that the Bill seeks to address, technology companies have for too long practised planned obsolescence to boost consumer demand. They design lifespans of products, such as smartphones and laptop computers, to be artificially short so that consumers are forced to ditch functional products and acquire new ones. Some devices are also designed to be difficult to repair, or with replacement parts that are tightly controlled by the company, thereby making it challenging to extend their lifespans through replacing faulty parts. Consumers find it far easier to buy a whole new device and junk the old one.In contrast, consider the Dutch social enterprise Fairphone which produces smartphones with significantly less environmental impact. Fairphones are designed to be easy to open, repair and upgrade. For example, Fairphone owners can unscrew their phones and replace the cameras, thereby enjoying the latest technology without having to buy an entirely new phone. Their phones are designed to last for at least five years, more than twice the standard 24-month smartphone replacement cycle.Examples such as Fairphone show us that resource sustainability is achievable through reinvention, especially if we introduce the right levers. In addition to the much welcomed Resource Sustainability Act, therefore, I would like to ask the Minister to consider introducing additional laws to combat the exploitative practice of planned obsolescence, as well as laws to strengthen consumers' rights to repair their electrical and electronic products.The next \"R\" we must act upon is to recalibrate. It is time we recalibrate people's expectations for what constitutes excellent service and warm hospitality. When did we transform into a society where events must involve goody bags, bottled water and an oversupply of catered food? How did our homes start to be filled with conference swag – stuff we all get – that we dump into landfills after engaging in Marie-Kondo-inspired spring cleaning?Thankfully, these norms need not be cast in stone. Collectively, we can forge fresh norms that help to advance resource sustainability. Conference organisers should dispense with goody bags, hotels can do away with small toiletries bottles and bakeries must discontinue this practice of wrapping buns in individual bags.I was delighted to learn before entering the House today that Fairprice is starting a month-long trial to charge for plastic bags in various outlets.Every industry can identify positive disruptions to enhance environmental sustainability. Once we create new norms, we recalibrate consumer expectations and break the cycle of wasteful product practices that seem to be more entrenched as we become more affluent.Finally, the third \"R\" is to reward. Beyond punitive measures that clearly have their place in our eco-system, we must also consider introducing more schemes to reward companies and consumers for their efforts towards resource sustainability.As the recent study by the Singapore Environment Council on building a circular food economy revealed, an estimated $2.54 billion of food loss occurs in Singapore from farm to market annually. This astounding loss must be addressed.We need to introduce more incentive schemes for companies to invest in technology to extend the shelf-life of food items. We also have to encourage different players within the food supply chain to collaborate on practicable solutions to stemming food waste. We should also develop Singapore as a centre where we specialise in innovations to transform food waste streams into valuable by-products. By rewarding such investments, collaborations and innovations, we can steer companies towards greater resource sustainability.Similarly, on the consumer level, we can introduce schemes to change consumer behaviour. Those who choose options with a smaller carbon footprint can be rewarded with loyalty points that translate into discounts. Similarly, consumers can be encouraged to reward companies that offer more green alternatives through rating and voting systems. Step by step, through actions big and small, we can shift mindsets and change behaviour for the better.In conclusion Mr Deputy Speaker, I firmly support the Resource Sustainability Bill and urge companies and consumers to reduce, reuse and recycle, but also to reinvent, recalibrate and reward.4.46 pmMr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, please allow me to declare my interests as the President of Singapore Manufacturing Federation, Vice Chairman of Singapore Business Federation, Vice President of Singapore National Employers Federation and Chairman of Sakae Holdings Limited. I rise in support of the Resource Sustainability Bill.The Resource Sustainability Bill seeks to better manage three critical waste streams: electrical and electronic waste; packaging waste, including plastics; and, food waste.Over the last few years, as sustainability took on greater prominence worldwide, I am happy to report that as a federation, the Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) has through our various industry groups held numerous events and dialogues with the manufacturing community with a focus on the journey towards Zero Waste. In fact, the SMF has a function committee set up to advocate good practices specifically in the fields of health, safety, security and environment.One of the cross-industry collaborative examples which I am proud to share is that for the first time, the packaging industry group and the food and beverage industry group jointly held the annual Packaging Council of Singapore Conference, titled \"Journey towards Zero Waste\".However, while trade associations and chambers such as the SMF continue to champion the need for environmental awareness and conservation, it is clear that there are some speed bumps which we must address preliminarily. These take the form of the following: business priorities and increasingcosts; support for the required reporting processes; and thirdly, education, outreach and enforcement.Mr Deputy Speaker Sir, please allow me now to move into each of the three areas of wastes identified by this Bill and share with this House pertinent views from the industry players in the three sectors.Under the Bill, E-waste, which encompasses electrical and electronic consumer equipment, large scale producers are required to fund a Producer Responsibility Organisation (PRO) which will be responsible for organising e-waste collection and recycling. This move brings Singapore on par with numerous similar collection and recycling initiatives worldwide, including Japan's Home Appliance Recycling Law, the EU's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive), the US state recycling laws on waste electrical and electronic equipment.Many MNCs have taken it upon themselves to include waste management into their business strategy as part of their sustainability responsibilities. I agree that more can be done and more companies in Singapore need to take active measures to be on par with global standards. There are already a number of retailer-driven collection initiatives in place in Singapore. With the collection efforts being moved to the producers as well, there is optimism that we will truly be able to close the loop and have some materials recovered for future use by the producers.Yet, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a legitimate and common concern for the industry – will there be any form of support, in terms of funding or subsidies, for the extra manpower or training of manpower for the required reporting processes detailed in this Bill?I now move to speak on Packaging Waste. The Packaging Council of Singapore, or PCS in short, is an Industry Group of the SMF representing the local packaging industry, not just locally but also at the world and Asian levels of the packaging world.Since five years ago, the PCS has been organising an Annual Star Awards to recognise outstanding packaging innovations, some of which have also won international acclaim. At this year’s awards held last month in August, Senior Minister of State for Health and Law Mr Edwin Tong graced the event as the Guest of Honour. In his keynote speech at the event, Mr Tong noted that many of this year’s winners displayed environmental awareness by innovating packaging materials and design with the use of recycled or more environmentally friendly products.While there is still much room to improve in this particular industry, especially in relation to packaging materials for the food and beverage industry, I am heartened to see companies already creating packaging solutions for commercial use by utilising recycled materials such as crop waste and mineral stone instead of plastics. I am especially happy and proud to add that, of the 29 awardees of the awards this year, 20 were awarded to students from our local Polytechnics. This demonstrates that our young and our future are already gearing up for a future where sustainable materials should take centrestage.The next steps for the packaging industry would be for companies downstream to adopt and use sustainable solutions and thereby further encouraging future innovations.However, the use of such sustainable packaging may in some industries lead to increasedcosts. For some companies, and even some sole proprietors, such as those operating food stalls, the increase in suchcosts are not justifiable even if indeed in the long run, such options may prove to be more beneficial. I would therefore like to ask the Minister if there are plans to incentivise the use of more sustainable packaging materials or disincentivise the use of non-environmentally friendly packaging.In addition, under this Bill, producers now have to report the amount of packaging put to market annually. While this will definitely give an idea of the packaging volume we are dealing with, packaging producers share the same concerns as their electronic and electrical counter parts in terms of support required for the additional manpower which I stated earlier in my speech. Mr Deputy Speaker, in Chinese, please.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]The next area of focus of the Bill is that of food waste. In Singapore, food waste has grown by around 30% over the last 10 years. In 2018, 738 million kg of food waste was generated.When food is wasted, there is a need to source for more food to meet demand, which results in increasedcosts. Resources that were used to grow and deliver the food is also wasted and more resources are also consumed to dispose of the waste.In the Journey to Zero Waste, businesses play a major role. Adoption of smart storage and preparation processes reduces excess food production and wastage. In the food waste management strategy laid out in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint 2015, the key goal is to Prevent and Reduce Food Wastage at Source. In this regard, a Food Waste Minimisation Guidebook for Food Manufacturing Establishments is now available from the National Environment Agency to help businesses with this goal.It is undeniable that for food manufacturers, waste reduction and management is key, and this should be part of the long-term business operations for major companies. The SMF is committed to continue to hold dialogues to assist companies on this journey. Under this Bill, from 2024, commercial and industrial premises that generate large amounts of food waste must segregate and treat the food waste on their premises.For food producers seeking to treat their own food waste, they do see that this is a way forward. However, the concern from local companies operating at scale is what resources will be made available in terms of equipment and training since waste treatment is quite a specific process.In addition, the generation of waste from the food industry can also be attributed to the transportation process of the supply chain. In this context, may I ask the Minister if there are plans to better support the infrastructure for better standards in cold food chain management to reduce food loss and waste? And relatedly, if more incentives can be made available for food manufacturers to buy more local farm produce?Mr Speaker, Sir, with the above, it is clear that the plank in the concerns of industry players are the immediate increasedcosts and resources available for them in navigating the sustainability journey. For some businesses, especially SMEs, the actual or perceivedcosts of changing their business model towards a more sustainability friendly model may indeed become the obstacle.In this regard, may I ask the Minister if there are plans for the Ministry to help encourage financial institutions to give more \"green financing\" in the manufacturing sector? While the \"green financing\" concept is relatively known to the building sector, this does not seem to have gained traction in other sectors.Further, the manufacturing industry would like to lobby for more support for SMEs to help secure loans when they raise their sustainability standards. This would also play a part in enabling the circular economy as expressed by the Ministry for the electronics and food manufacturing industries.(In English): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill is welcomed because of the common consensus that this world does not belong to any one generation but always to the next. Yet, the concerns that I have raised above are indeed legitimate concerns especially in the current uncertain global economic climate.As a strong advocate of Singapore's own brand of tripartite partnership that of the Government, the employers and the employees working as one, I am confident that the issues I have raised earlier in my speech can be overcome. Continued dialogues and cross-engagement amongst all three groups will be key. The Government looks to the employers for their support in achieving the objectives of a sustainable future. The employers look to the Government for direction and support and the employees look to their employers to learn how their own individual conduct in the office can affect the environment. The concerns, views and contributions of each individual group of the tripartite partnership must always be valued and should never be trivialised.As a trade association, the SMF has already been working closely with the Singapore Environment Council, the SEC in short, on a couple of initiatives. The first is to help industries embed green culture and DNA by certifying them with the \"Eco-Office\" mark which helps employees in companies better understand the co-relation between climate change and their behavioural attitudes in the workplace.Secondly, the SMF is also working with SEC to develop an \"Eco-Manufacturing\" certification label to ensure that environmental sustainability standards and capabilities are raised and embedded in companies. The Eco-Manufacturing initiative will encourage companies to continue to set higher standards in sustainability.In concluding my speech, it is my heartfelt hope that with support from the Ministry, other trade associations and chambers will all come together and work together with the SMF in achieving a better future for our next generations."

        "MPs Speaking": "[The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M), Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon), Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr Deputy Speaker, Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M, Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio), Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M, Mr Speaker, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M, Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M]",
        "Content": "Order for Second Reading read.3.28 pmThe Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"The Public Utilities Act was last amended in February 2018. Since then, the work of PUB has continued to evolve.First, as I had announced during myCOSspeech a few days ago, PUB will be given an expanded mandate to defend our coasts against rising sea levels.Second, as PUB continues to diversify Singapore’s water sources, the number of desalination and NEWater plants has increased. There will be 10 such plants by the end of the year, up from seven in February 2018.Third, PUB continues to leverage technology to improve service quality. As announced in January this year, PUB will roll out some 300,000 smart water meters in homes and commercial and industrial buildings by 2023.Lastly, to complement PUB's efforts in ensuring the security of our water supply, we will also need building owners and managers to do their part to keep our water supply system secure, by protecting their water tanks against unauthorised access.Against the backdrop of these developments, it is necessary to update the Public Utilities Act in four key areas to ensure that it remains effective and relevant. Let me go through each group of amendments in turn.The first group of amendments will expressly confer new coastal protection functions on PUB and legislate the new Coastal and Flood Protection Fund.PUB is currently the national authority for drainage and inland flood protection. Given the synergy in tackling inland flooding and coastal inundation risks together in a holistic manner, the Government has tasked PUB to be the national Coastal Protection Agency. PUB will work with agencies and other stakeholders to enhance our coastline defences and coordinate policies to facilitate decisions on land use, development and activities to safeguard Singapore against rising sea levels.To provide for the substantial capital outlay and implement coastal and flood protection in a fiscally sustainable manner, Deputy Prime Minister announced in his Budget speech that a Coastal and Flood Protection Fund will be set up within PUB, with an initial injection of $5 billion from the Government's FY2020 Budget.We will use this fund prudently to implement coastal protection measures, which could include sea walls, tidal gates and pumping stations. These are all being studied, and may need to be deployed together to prevent flooding. The Fund will also be used to help PUB expand Singapore’s drainage infrastructure to cope with more intense rainfall arising from climate change.The Coastal and Flood Protection Fund signals the Government’s resolve in tackling long-term existential challenges such as climate change. Prime Minister mentioned at the National Day Rally last year that climate change adaptation mightcost $100 billion or more over the next 100 years. Given the significant outlay, we will need a combination of funding methods to finance our adaptation measures.The Coastal and Flood Protection Fund will be just one source of funding. We will study this closely and assess what other appropriate funding sources should be used. These sources may include budgets of Ministries, borrowing and tapping on Past Reserves where land reclamation is involved.Climate change defence is existential for Singapore. The Prime Minister also said in his National Day Rally speech, that everything else must bend at the knees to safeguard the existence of our island nation. Planning and investing long-term for coastal defences and national flood protection will be critical to ensure that Singapore has adequate resources to meet this challenge.The second group of amendments will provide for legislative safeguards over our water infrastructure, especially water supply plants. As the House is aware, we have been diversifying our water sources by building up four national taps over the decades. The intent is to safeguard our water security.As we build up our desalination and NEWater capacity, PUB has partnered the private sector to design, build, own and operate our DBOO, some of our desalination and NEWater plants. This DBOO model allows PUB to tap on the expertise and resources of the private sector to deliver water solutions mostcost-effectively.By the end of this year, PUB will have six out of 10 desalination and NEWater plants under the DBOO model. The remaining four plants are owned and operated by PUB.For the DBOO plants, PUB has put in place robust contractual safeguards to ensure water security. For example, concession companies that own and operate DBOO plants are obliged to seek PUB’s approval when there is a change in control. Under the contractual terms, PUB can terminate the contracts and buy over the plants, or in some cases, step in to operate the plants, should the need arise. We have successfully executed some of these contractual remedies in the past to ensure our water security.Water security is critical to Singapore’s national security. While we have already strong contractual safeguards, given that water security is an existential issue to Singapore, we need to always look for ways to strengthen safeguards over our water infrastructure. We have reviewed the regulatory regimes of other critical infrastructure, such as electricity and telecommunications, and concluded that it would be prudent to adopt similar legislative safeguards that are already in place in these sectors.Taking reference from these other legislation, the Bill will strengthen PUB's oversight of the concession companies. These concession companies, as well as any underlying trusts or business trusts that may be set up to hold the plant assets, will be designated by PUB and be subject to additional oversight mechanisms under the Bill.Broadly, under clause 8, all designated parties will be subject to three types of oversight controls.First, a person who becomes a substantial controller or indirect controller of the designated parties that own and operate the DBOO plants will need to notify or seek approval from PUB. This is to ensure that control of DBOO plants rests with individuals or groups whose interests are aligned with the long-term interests of Singapore’s water security and the public interest. For example, we may need to ensure that there is sufficient diversity in the ownership and operation of DBOO plants in Singapore. This will reduce the risk to Singapore’s water security from having mega conglomerates monopolising our critical infrastructure but then unexpectedly collapsing. Given the strategic role that DBOO plants play in Singapore’s water security, PUB must maintain oversight of controllers who directly or indirectly control substantial equity interest and/or voting power in these designated parties.Second, these designated parties cannot be dissolved, terminated or wound up voluntarily without PUB’s consent. The dissolution, termination or winding up of these designated parties will adversely affect our water security. If there are court proceedings for the dissolution, termination or winding up of these designated parties, PUB will be a party to such proceedings, and the court must consider representations made by PUB in such proceedings.This ensures that the court does not make any decision without having considered water security considerations. In addition, the creditors of these designated parties cannot enforce security over the property of such parties, or enforce any court order against such parties, without giving prior notice to PUB.Third, the Minister will be empowered to issue Special Administration Orders (SAOs). An SAO is an order of the Minister directing the takeover of control of the affairs, business and property of a designated party by another person, so as to ensure the continued operations of the DBOO plant for the public interest.Mr Speaker, Sir, we are mindful that while such powers are similarly found in the other legislation I referenced earlier, concession companies may have some concerns over these powers. I would like to assure Members that these levers will not be exercised lightly and the Bill has limited their use to exceptional circumstances, such as when Singapore’s water security is under threat. As far as possible, PUB will continue to rely on existing contractual safeguards where appropriate, which have served PUB well thus far. But as I mentioned earlier, when it comes to water security, we take no chances.The third group of amendments relate to smart water meters. Clauses 2, 5, 6, 7 and 11 will update the Public Utilities Act to extend existing powers of PUB in relation to water meter installation, maintenance and enforcement to cover smart water meters.These powers will support PUB’s Smart Water Meter Programme, the first phase of which involves the deployment of some 300,000 meters, starting from next year, in new and existing residential, commercial and industrial premises. This will allow PUB to leverage digital technologies to encourage behavioural change towards water conservation, optimise water demand management, and achieve greater operational efficiencies.The updated provisions would empower PUB to: first, install smart water meters, including ancillary equipment; second, enter premises at reasonable hours or at such other time as may be agreed with the owner or occupier of the premise to carry out inspection or works on smart water meters; third, direct the owner to remove any object that hinders or obstructs access to a smart water meter; and fourth, take action against any person who interferes, interrupts or obstructs with the operation of a smart water meter supplied by PUB. In addition, the amendments specify the circumstances under which a person would be presumed to have tampered with a smart water meter and thus committed an offence.The last group of amendments relate to water tank security. While PUB had made great efforts to protect its water infrastructure and ensure that potable water supplied to consumers is safe and fit for drinking, building owners and managing agents also have a part to play in ensuring our water remains safe for drinking. For example, they need to take the necessary steps to prevent unauthorised access to the water tanks in their buildings, as these intrusions may disrupt or contaminate the water supply to consumers.Currently, a lapse in water tank security, such as failing to lock the water tank access door, is already an offence under the Public Utilities (Water Supply) Regulations. The offence carries a maximum penalty of $10,000, or imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both. PUB can offer to compound the offence by collecting a sum not exceeding $3,000.Clause 10 introduces a new section 45A to provide increased deterrence and enhance the security of water tanks by raising the maximum penalty amount for such offences to a fine of $50,000, or imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both. This is in line with the maximum penalty amount for causing contamination to the water supply by PUB, or interfering with or disrupting PUB’s water supply. In addition, the maximum composition sum for such offences will also be increased from $3,000 to $10,000.The increased penalties will serve to remind building owners and management teams to take water tank security seriously. The vast majority of the building owners and management teams are diligent in ensuring water tank security and need not be concerned by the change.Mr Speaker, in summary, PUB’s work continues to evolve. As PUB takes on a new role to defend our coasts, it also continues to diversify our water sources, digitalise its operations, and enhance water security. The proposed amendments to the Public Utilities Act that I have elaborated on in my speech are necessary to ensure that the Public Utilities Act remains effective and relevant. Ultimately, these proposed amendments will allow PUB to continue to fulfil its mission of safeguarding our water security, and ensuring a safe and reliable supply of water for all. Sir, I beg to move.Question proposed.3.42 pmEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, climate change and global warming have caused sea levels around the world to rise. Singapore, being a small island nation surrounded by water, is vulnerable to rising sea levels. So, we must seriously take action to protect our country and our future generations as climate change is not a distant problem. It is right on our shores.The establishment of the Coast and Flood Protection Fund is a concrete step in the right direction. It demonstrates the Government's commitment to make good judgement and give priority to Singapore’s long-term interests. I know it is tempting for some political leaders to kick the can down the road, leaving it to the next government to handle. But not this Government in Singapore.Even amidst other challenges for budget, we must not be distracted from this crucial challenge.Substantial funding is necessary to implement the coastal protection and drainage measures. During the National Day Rally last year, our Prime Minister mentioned that coastal defences maycost $100 billion or more over 100 years. What are the Government’s plans to ensure that there will be sufficient money in the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund?As I believe existing infrastructure will have to be enhanced, or even new infrastructure may have to be built as part of the protection measures, I hope we will tap on local resources and companies for these works? So, besides shoring up our coastal defences, we can also shore up our job creation for Singaporeans, and the local knowledge around such projects.Water security is also a critical issue. The low rainfall in Singapore and droughts affecting our neighbours such as Malaysia from whom we get our water supply give rise to grave concerns.There are different scenarios that can be played out: (a) reduce the supply of water to us; or (b) see the price of water going up.The PUB has been doing a good job over the years to improve our self-sufficiency on water. By this year, PUB will have three desalination plants, and three NEWater plants under the Design-Build-Own-Operate (DBOO) model. This means that a private organisation builds, owns and operates some of the facilities or structure of the plants, but there is some degree of support from the Government. Together, these plants make up a significant part of our water supply. It is important for us to strengthen oversight of these DBOO plants.I note that the amendments to the Bill will now allow PUB to be informed of, or to give approval to companies or persons gaining significant control of these critical water infrastructure. I support this as water is our critical national resource. We have to ensure that these DBOO plants are in good hands and operate reliably to meet our nation's water needs.However, given that PUB has been partnering with the private sector under the DBOO model for over 10 years, with majority of the partnerships being successful, some may wonder was the decision triggered by the situation with Hyflux? Definitely, this is a good move. Perhaps MCCY should also introduce this over our Sports Hub.The Bill also introduces powers for the Minister to issue Special Administration Orders under certain circumstances. This will allow the Government to take steps to ensure that Singapore’s water security is not compromised, such as by ensuring that the DBOO plants continue to operate regardless of circumstances. Nonetheless, the concession companies of these DBOO plants may be concerned about whether these powers will affect their rights and interests under their existing agreements with PUB. Can the Minister clarify when Special Administration Orders will be invoked, versus the existing contractual safeguards?Even as our Government and Public services work tirelessly to develop our self-sufficiency and grow our water supply, we must not rest on our laurels, and we certainly cannot be complacent. I would like to take this opportunity to remind everybody that water security is not the sole responsibility of the Government. Every one of us residing in Singapore, from commercial entities and organisations to individuals, must play our part to use water responsibly. Let us reduce, reuse and recycle water and do our part to mitigate the impact of climate change. Sir, in Chinese, please.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]The Government has a long-term vision and plan to build more barrages along our coastlines. May I ask if we could deploy more local companies to build these barrages? This will not only help our local companies, but also ensure that we have enough relevant knowledge that will be useful in time of crises.The Government also seeks to be empowered to issue Special Administration Orders to the water supply companies. This will further ensure our water security. However, it may also bring some uncertainties to relevant companies. Can the Minister clarify under what circumstances these powers will be invoked? I would like to take this opportunity to remind members of the public that protection of water resources is not just the responsibility of the Government. Everyone has a duty to save water to ensure that we have enough water resources.3.50 pmMr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio): Deputy Speaker, Sir, I applaud the decision to set up the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund. In the face of climate change, we have not a moment to lose. Our very survival depends on future-ready infrastructure and measures to kick start sustainable solutions. Very fortunately, Singapore has had some money set aside for contingencies like this. I really thank our predecessors from the bottom of my heart. Their hard work and thrift have made it possible for us to commence on ambitious projects like this.We have started with $5 billion for this Fund. The battle against rising sea levels will be a long-drawn-out and expensive one. Prime Minister Lee had estimated that coastal defence mightcost us $100 billion or more over 100 years. How is the Government going to ensure that we will have enough money in the long haul to sustain this Fund? In addition, the Fund must be ring-fenced and protected from the vagaries of domestic politics and economic cycles. Would the Minister share what measures will be in place to ensure strict oversight and prudent utilisation of the Fund?I expect that seawalls, land reclamation and planting of mangroves would be considered for different parts of our coast.  Would the Minister tell us what are some examples of the types of coastal protection and drainage infrastructure which will be financed by the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund?Due to our geographical constraints, we will have to cooperate with our immediate neighbouring countries for some of these coastal works for the benefit of all people. I would like to know where would be the areas we will need to consult with neighbours before proceeding with the appropriate constructions.Next, I welcome the relevant amendments and continual investments by both public and private sectors in our domestic water treatment capability. These will enhance our water security. However, the question remains on the feasibility of the Design-Build-Own-Operate (DBOO) model. Would the Ministry consider other models?In addition, will the Ministry be able to keep the facilities financially independent and operational while the operator is struggling to keep the company going, falling short of triggering the invocation of Special Administration Orders by the Minister or seeking redress by the high court? Is the list of events of default sufficiently comprehensive? Have they been reviewed to ensure that they are not overly rigid or restrictive in order for the Minister to invoke the orders when necessary? With that, I conclude my support for the Bill.Mr Deputy Speaker: Minister Masagos.3.53 pmMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Members for the support and comments on the Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill. I just want to make one comment that Er Dr Lee Bee Wah mentioned about self-sufficiency. I think we have to be careful about this word. We are not self-sufficient, but we should say we are resilient. We are resilient against weather, we are resilient against possibly climate change just to put a point across. Thank you.Let me run through the queries and concerns raised topically. I will begin by addressing coastal and flood protection issues first.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked for about the Government's plans to ensure that there are sufficient funds in the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund. Climate change and rising sea levels will not only affect our current generation but future generations and beyond. Coastal protection requires hefty upfront investments. But once built, they benefit many generations of Singaporeans. This is a complex and significant, long-haul effort and we need to distribute the share of funding more equitably across current and future generations.The $5 billion injection from this term of Government represents our generation’s contribution towards safeguarding Singapore’s continued survival. Setting up the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund now provides us with a longer runway to build up the Fund, and allows the Government to save up across successive terms. The Government will top up the Fund whenever our fiscal situation allows.Given the significant outlay required, the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund will not be the only source of funding. We have to use a combination of funding tools – the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund, borrowing, budget from the Government-of-the-day, as well as past reserves for measures such as land reclamation. PUB is working with agencies to refine our modelling and develop more detailed plans on the type of protection measures required and thecosts. This will allow the Government to better assess the funding required and financing options.Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked what measures will be in place to ensure strict oversight and prudent utilisation of the Fund.First, it will be ring-fence through this legislative amendments to fund expenditures relating to coastal and drainage flood protection measures.Second, PUB will have oversight over the management and withdrawal of the Fund. PUB will publish the Fund utilisation annually in a separate section in its financial statements.Third like any other large scale and complex development projects the Government undertakes coastal protection and drainage measures will continue to be subject to MOF's evaluation and prevailing approval processes.Finally, the Government will also employ a competitive tendering processes to ensure that thecost of the coastal protection and drainage measures implemented are value for money.Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked for some examples of the uses of the Fund. Ensuring our flood resilience will require careful planning and seamless integration of protection measures in our infrastructure. First, to prevent sea waters from flowing inland, we will need to construct structures such as sea walls, revetments, dykes, tide gates or barrages to serve as coastal defences and physical barriers. We will study the feasibility of all these options for our coastline. Where feasible, we could even integrate nature-based solutions, such as the planting of mangroves to break wave energy. While structures such as tidal gates and barrages stop sea water from flowing inland, they would likewise prevent storm water from flowing out into the sea, especially when intense rainstorms coincide with high tides. As such, we will need to install outlet pumps at some of our waterways to pump floodwaters into the sea. Finally, our vast network of inland drains must also be expanded and upgraded to cater to more intense and frequent rainfall.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah rightly pointed out the extent of infrastructure works required to protect our coastline. She asked if we will tap on local resources and companies in this journey. Coastal protection is a new area in Singapore and capabilities will need to be built up. We will indeed have to tap on the best engineering capabilities available. Where they are not available in Singapore, we will have to bring them in, even as we grow our own talent and capabilities. The Government and industry will have to work hand in hand. We are confident that over time, we will grow a strong and vibrant local industry, just like what we did with our water sector. We hope that our local firms will proactively build up their capabilities in coastal protection, hydraulic modelling, and flood risk forecasting just to name a few areas, and to tap on these opportunities when available.I will next address the questions on safeguards over PUB's DBOO plants. Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about the feasibility of the DBOO model and whether other operating models for water plants have been considered. Besides the DBOO models, PUB also employs other models. For example, PUB employs the design and build model where it partners the private sector to design and build the plants while PUB owns and operates the plants.As explained in my opening speech. the DBOO model has been useful in allowing us to tap on private sector innovations andcost efficiencies to deliver water services more effectively. By combining design, build, own and operate functions in the same DBOO contract, it gives the private sector a strong incentive to ensure that the project design takes into consideration operational and other life-cyclecosts.The DBOO model also strengthens the capacity of the private sector, just like Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has asked just now. When companies undertake DBOO projects, we hope they develop a track record that allows them to grow in our region and compete on the world stage.Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about PUB's ability to maintain oversight over concession companies which are struggling. As I had explained in this House in April 2019, even though PUB does not interfere with business decisions made by the concession companies, PUB monitors the performance of the plants under the DBOO models to ensure that the concession companies can meet the contractual obligations to PUB. Concession companies are required to submit financial reports to PUB on a regular basis. Where there are issues, PUB will require the concession companies to rectify them, failing which, PUB may exercise its right to terminate the DBOO contracts and take control of the plants. These contractual oversight will continue and, with the new legislative mechanism, will have greater assurance and oversight over our DBOO plants.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah rightly pointed out that PUB has been partnering with the private sector under DBOO model for over 10 years. The majority of these partnerships have been successful. Given this, why the decision to introduce legislative levers over DBOO plants now? Allow me to explain.As part of our regular review of the safeguards over DBOO plants, we observe that, unlike other critical infrastructure, the Government did not have legislative safeguards for critical water infrastructure under the Public Utilities Act. We concluded that it would be prudent to put in place similar safeguards, especially as more DBOO plants are being completed.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah also asked if the legislative levers over DBOO plants are triggered by the Hyflux situation. The review to enhance our oversight over DBOO plants started way before the Hyflux situation emerged. That said, the Hyflux situation was a reminder that we need to exercise proper oversight over our DBOO plants which are a key part of our water supply infrastructure and have effective levers to intervene when necessary in order to ensure Singapore's water security. As mentioned in my opening speech, PUB has in place robust contractual safeguards which allowed us to successfully execute the contractual remedies for the Tuaspring Desalination Plant.With the additional legislative safeguards introduced under this Bill, we will further strengthen our oversight over critical water infrastructure and enhance our levers, in case it is necessary to intervene.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Gan Thiam Poh also asked for elaboration on when and how Special Administration Orders will be invoked versus the existing contractual safeguards.PUB's interest is in safeguarding Singapore's water security. The grounds under which the Minister can impose Special Administration Orders are: first, the designated party is or is likely to be unable to pay its debts; second, the occurrence of a public emergency; third, the Minister considers it in the interest of the security and reliability of the supply of water in Singapore; and fourth, the Minister considers it in the public interest. These are similar to those found in a Special Administration Order regime of other essential services.I would like to assure the House that the power to issue a Special Administration Order would not be exercised lightly. Such Orders are meant to ensure Singapore's water security and would be used only under exceptional circumstances. PUB will continue to rely on existing contractual remedies under the Water Purchase Agreements as far as possible.Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said in my opening speech, PUB's role continues to evolve. This Bill is an important step forward as PUB builds up its coastal and flood protection role, strengthens its oversight over water concession companies, implements smart water meters and enhances the security of our water tanks. Sir, with that, I beg to move.4.05 pmMr Speaker: Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah: Mr Speaker, I have one question to clarify with the Minister. Will PUB be employing more engineers so as to build up our in-house technical capability or would we be farming out the consultancy work?Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:  I think of all the agencies that I have seen, PUB is one that has always maintained strong lines of engineers. As old ones retire, new ones have learnt from them and they continue to give us the water security that we are comfortable with. With these new functions that we have taken up, we will certainly build the capabilities in-house, but we will not ignore cooperating with any other parties that can value-add to our functions.Question put, and agreed to.Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. – [Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M].Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed."

        "Content": "Climate Change–A Whole-of-Government (WOG) ApproachMr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade): Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head U of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\"The tragedy of climate change is not that it is not severe or insignificant. The real tragedy is that few people think of it urgently and deeply. Too often, it is a flashy speech, or some performative act that grabs attention for a brief moment and then, it is back to business as usual.So, it is heartening that even in the middle of a high profile and salient public health crisis, our Government has set aside the budget to deal with climate change – including $5 billion for coastal and flood protection measures.I have been speaking in the past about how Singapore has over time, built up its water security as well as various measures to reduce our weight on the environment. A few years ago, we set up the Singapore Centre for Climate Research in 2013. We are a member of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Last year, we put in place a carbon tax.But climate change requires all of us across different departments and Ministries to work together. For example, efficiency in energy consumption and waste disposal requires there to be strong collaboration across housing and transport sectors. We have already put in place guidelines to critical infrastructure such as air and seaports to be at least 4 metres above sea level. Given our long memories of floods, we have pump houses that transport storm water from reservoirs to the sea. Our beautiful Marina Barrage is actually a glorified anti-flooding pump.Meanwhile, we have seen one of the largest players in Singapore's built environment – the HDB, making a big difference under the Greenprint programme, solar panels and waste conveyance systems are embedded or will be embedded into HDB estates. On roads, there is now a determined push into more and better public transport systems – new service lines, larger bus fleets and bike-sharing initiatives. In policy, the Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme has been launched. In business, Waste-to-Energy plants reduce waste volumes by 90% and allow conversion to reusable energy.In the way we live, move and make money, Singapore is turning green. This is not by chance. We started life as a nation as a Garden City as a way to distinguish ourselves, as a disciplined and well-ordered society. So, it goes without saying that we need a whole-of-nation effort to deal with climate change.How is our Government working to foster collective action by businesses, the community and individuals to tackle this issue together?Question proposed.The Chairman: Er Dr Lee Bee Hwa.Government's Approach to Climate ChangeEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon): Chairman, we have heard much about Singapore's commitment to Climate Change and this is indeed encouraging. There was a consultation exercise on our long-term low-emissions development strategy last year. Can Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean share what is the outcome of this? Could Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean also share, are we on track to meet our commitment to the Paris Agreement?As we transit to a low-carbon future, what is the expected impact on our economy? Will it add to thecost of doing business in Singapore and therefore drive away some investors? On the other hand, how is Singapore leveraging green growth opportunities?Emissions ReductionMr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee): Mr Chairman, I am gratified that Singapore has always been conscious of the drastic impact that climate change has on our generation and more importantly on future generations. I am in support of the bold and proactive steps that the Government has taken over the last few years to reduce our carbon emissions. I would like to ask the Minister what strategies and plans will put in place for Singapore to continue to reduce our future emissions?Currently, 1.3% of Singapore’s generation capacity is from solar photovoltaic generation. Given that there are limited alternative renewable sources viable in Singapore, I would like to ask the Minister how Singapore will further reduce the emission from our energy consumption.As Singapore builds, a proposal would be to consider the entire life cycle of building materials and choose to use materials that can be recycled or reused, such as, for drains and roads. It would also be in our future vision to build and convert existing buildings to zero-energy or net-zero building buildings. I would ask the Minister what efforts and initiatives there are to make our nation building more sustainable?As a whole country effort is required to reduce emissions, I would also ask the Minister if we can create a National Green Mark to recognise local projects and businesses with initiatives and practices which reduce emissions and; grant incentives to the finance sector to provide funding to such businesses and projects.Green Strategies and OpportunitiesMr Desmond Choo (Tampines): Climate change is a substantial threat to Singapore. Not only must we protect our shores from rising waters. We must also fulfil our international obligations towards low carbon emissions development. We cannot survive on a moral Island burning fossil fuels while the rest of the world struggles to keep the cities above rising waters.The core to this must be a national strategy and blueprint that guides our agencies and people preparing for the city's future.Yet, the journey to protect ourselves is fraught with dilemmas and trade-offs. Controlling carbon emission through carbon taxes increases businesscost. Protecting our coastlines might have permanent ecological impact.The fossil fuels business is estimated to be 3% of Singapore's GDP. Weaning off fossil fuels requires a fundamental change to Singapore's economic strategy. The current generation would have to foot the coastal protection bill but they might not live to see the benefits.I will like to ask the Government what are the principles that it has adopted in developing our national strategy? How are the key stakeholders such as businesses, green groups and academics consulted? We must develop a strategy that balances trade-offs and brings together generations of people to pursue our climate change objectives sustainably. This meant that inter-generational trade-offs must be balanced carefully.I believe that there are also opportunities. As we have turned water scarcity into valuable knowledge of market value, what are the strategies that we pursuing to turn these threats into opportunities?The severity and enormity of the challenge requires us to plan way ahead but execute quickly. What are the concrete plans and programmes that have already been put in place since the Prime Minister’s announcement during the last National Day Rally?Pan-ASEAN Climate Change InitiativesMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Sir, it came as welcome news late last year to read of the Government-owned company, SP Power, looking to decarbonise our electricity sector in favour of renewables, by potentially working with neighbours such as Malaysia and Indonesia. With spare land to install solar panels or wind turbines, something practically impossible to undertake on a large enough scale in land-scare Singapore, building transmission lines to connect to our neighbours would allow Singapore to readily tap on clean power and significantly reduce our reliance for fossil fuels for electricity generation. It would also significantly enlarge our green footprint and boost our contribution to reduce the debilitating effects of climate change.In addition, on the prospects of a pan-ASEAN electricity grid, an SP official was quoted as saying that Malaysia already has connections to Thailand which in turn has connections to Laos. Hypothetically therefore, Singapore could invest in clean energy projects in neighbouring countries beyond our immediate neighbours and use renewable energy credits to receive the same amount of electricity from Malaysia, for example.Sir, could PMO share more details about these initiatives and confirm the timeline of these projects that look at tapping electricity from regional power grids? What does this mean for the consumer and power generators in Singapore, not to mention the price of electricity?I understand some discussions have already taken place with Malaysia for greater cooperation in this regard. What risk does the Government anticipate in reducing our carbon footprint by diversifying and tapping on regional electricity grids and how can these be overcome?Finally, the regional and global consequences of climate change provide a unique opportunity to look into further ASEAN wide collaborations that promote green policies. In view of easier access to the markets and our R&D sector, how can Singapore contribute to addressing regional climate change challenges and imagining commercial solutions in view of the active interest in addressing climate change – a top policy priority for younger Singaporeans in particular?Climate ChangeMiss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines): Sir, climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world. On 9 February 2020, a Brazilian-run research station recorded an extreme temperature of 20.75 degrees celsius in the Antarctic. The first ever temperature recorded of over 20 degrees Celsius. Temperatures around the world continue to rise, melting ice into oceans and causing sea levels to rise. This poses existential challenges to our Island state.We have to act decisively on climate change. I am heartened that the Government has carried out a public consultation in 2019 to discuss how we could formulate our long-term low-emissions development strategy. Can the Government share its plans to reduce our emissions? What are the various factors the Government took into consideration?Moving ahead, we also need to look into achieving sustainable development, continue to create good jobs while ensuring a well-managed transition to a low carbon future. The transition while challenging, also poses various opportunities in the green economy related innovation. How can Singapore leverage green growth opportunities and how we plan to rally businesses, the community and individuals to be part of it?1.45 pmInternational Efforts on Climate ChangeMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Mr Chairman, climate change is a global issue that requires collective efforts on a united and international front. Beyond mitigating our domestic emissions, how can Singapore contribute to international efforts? What are the key areas of international cooperation needed to achieve Singapore's climate goals?I have, in a Parliamentary Question before expressed my concerns on our role in Coal-fired and Gas-fired Independent Power Producer (IPP) Projects in the ASEAN region. The biggest environment problem amongst some ASEAN members is the plan to increase such projects, which will emit large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, and I think that the way forward is to boost renewables financing in ASEAN, which is currently taking place at a very slow rate.Can the Senior Minister also share how they have been supporting our financial sector to make the transition to promote more green financing in Singapore? I hope we can explore my proposal to kickstart a first loss fund for renewables projects in ASEAN, with other ASEAN sovereign wealth funds, including Singapore's, chipping in later on. This is certainly something I have discussed on other occasions, at various forums for investors and financial institutions. But for the Singapore Government, in this case, to spearhead the efforts, I think it will be a very good opportunity to boost our international profile and it will be a more effective way for ASEAN and Singapore to reduce carbon emissions globally, more effectively and fast.Measurement of Carbon Emission LevelsMs Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong): Chairman, the Government's commitment to a low carbon future and reduction of greenhouse gases is welcomed. One key effort was passing the Carbon Pricing Act, which took effect last year. However, there has been some doubt about the effectiveness of carbon taxing in Singapore as some say it does not guarantee the desired level of emissions reduction.I understand that the Young PAP conducted a focus group discussion recently with climate activists and experts from the sustainability sector. Amongst the issues discussed was the perceived over-emphasis on economic metrics as a means of calculating growth. Some felt that such metrics encouraged excessive production and consumption. Also, the current calculations of emission levels against GDP value may not truly reflect current performance levels. Can the Government consider a review to measure absolute carbon emission levels against holistic progress indicators, such as the Human Development Index or the United Nations Environment Inclusive Wealth Index?I note that the Government had also carried out a public consultation exercise last year to discuss formulating Singapore's long-term low-emissions development strategy and the findings were released in early February. Can the Government give an update on Singapore's plans moving forward?The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Teo Chee Hean): Mr Chairman, Sir, across the globe, the effects of climate change are clear and present. Weather patterns have become more extreme; ice sheets and glaciers are melting. Singapore, too, has experienced more episodes of unusually heavy rainfall accompanied by some flooding. Prolonged dry weather exacerbates the smoke haze that affects our region. As a low-lying island, we remain fundamentally vulnerable.The Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC), which I chair, was formed in 2007. IMCCC coordinates, formulates and monitors the execution of our national plans to reduce our carbon emissions, referred to as mitigation, and to prepare for the consequences of climate change, referred to as adaptation.In his Budget speech, Deputy Prime Minister Heng stated Singapore's intention to chart our vision for a low carbon, sustainable future. Allow me, Mr Chairman, to inform this House of our plans.Later this year, Singapore will submit our enhanced 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement. We will also submit our Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) for 2050 and beyond to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Our enhanced 2030 NDC and LEDS build on policies and initiatives we have progressively implemented over the years. They demonstrate our seriousness and commitment to support international climate action and a low carbon future.Setting out our vision well in advance, will provide a clear sense of direction and give ourselves and our various stakeholders the time to effect a well-managed transition to a low carbon economy. This will also allow us to grow new sectors in our economy and create new jobs and opportunities.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr Desmond Choo, Mr Ong Teng Koon and Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked about the Government's approach and strategies for climate change. The development of our enhanced NDC for 2030 and our LEDS aspiration for 2050 and beyond, is guided by a principled approach. It is considered, it is committed and it is collective.We fully appreciate the significance and impact of climate change. This is why climate change policy is being strongly coordinated as a key whole-of-nation issue under the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). Our climate policies and strategies are carefully and thoroughly considered. At the same time, we are not exclusively focused on climate change. We look at realistic and practical policies and measures we can implement, taking into account the best available science and technology, and fully integrated with the larger context of the entire range of challenges we face in our national policy framework. This is the approach we take to ensure a smooth and well-managed transition to a low carbon economy.We have always believed that the pursuit of economic growth can be compatible and mutually reinforcing with environmental objectives. This approach has allowed Singapore today to have one of the lowest carbon emissions per GDP dollar, or emissions intensity. We are ranked among the 20 best countries out of 141 countries in 2017. Our performance on the Human Development Index and the UN Sustainable Development Goals are also very commendable.This has been a collective effort. We invited views and consulted Singaporeans on important climate issues, such as the carbon tax, achieving zero waste and our LEDS. We received many suggestions on how to reduce our emissions. In fact, over 2,000. At the same time, our contributors also recognised that there are practical constraints and potential trade-offs.In particular, we are very mindful of our limited alternative energy options. Singapore's geography is a key limiting factor in our ability to harness renewable energy at scale. We do not have great rivers for hydropower. Wind power is limited both by space as well as light and variable winds. We continue to study the potential for nuclear power, but we assess that the current generation of nuclear power plants are not suitable for deployment in Singapore.So, these are serious constraints compared to better-endowed countries. Nevertheless, we are committed to doing our best and doing our part to combat climate change. Our enhanced NDC and LEDS set out realistic but challenging and ambitious goals for Singapore, drawing on citizens' suggestions and taking into account our national circumstances. Let me elaborate.In 2015, we set our 2030 NDC target to reduce our emissions intensity in 2030 by 36% from 2005 levels, and to peak by around 2030. We are on track to meet this commitment.Ms Rahayu Mahzam will be glad to know we will be enhancing our NDC by committing to an absolute peak emission level of 65 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent around 2030.  All countries are also now required to report on the 7thgreenhouse gas, Nitrogen Trifluoride (NF3) by 2024. We will go beyond reporting NF3, and commit to including NF3in our pledge, within this same emissions ceiling.Constraining our total emissions within this absolute cap up to 2030 means that every sector in Singapore will need to put in significant effort to limit our emissions. We will need to do so in order to move towards a low carbon nation in the coming decade, with new commercial and industrial enterprises and new growth areas, such as the digital economy. We all have a part to play in reducing our emissions to meet our 2030 commitment.But we aim to do better than that beyond 2030. Our Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy aspires to halve the emissions from our 2030 peak, to 33 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050, with a view to achieving net-zero emissions as soon as viable in the second half of the century.This will be very challenging, given our limited alternative energy options. We have studied the matter very carefully and developed a strategy to do so. And with your permission, Mr Chairman, may I display a slide on the House's screens, and request the Clerks to distribute a document to Members?The Chairman: Please do. [A handout was distributed to hon Members.]Mr Teo Chee Hean: There are three thrusts in our strategy.First, we need transformations in our industry, economy and society. Second, we have to draw on technologies which are not yet mature, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and low carbon fuels. And third, we will need international collaboration in areas, such as well-functioning carbon markets and regional electricity grids. So, this will help take us from the left-hand side, where we have our 2030 NDC through these three thrusts to the right-hand side, which is our LEDS for 2050 and beyond.Each thrust will contribute to halving our emissions. We will pursue all three vigorously to achieve our aspiration. The extent to which potential emission reductions from each thrust can be realised will become clearer in the coming years, as we gain experience from implementing our programmes, as technology evolves and as the modalities for international cooperation and collaboration become formalised. If the actual reductions from each thrust are larger than we now assess, or are available sooner, then we can realise our aspiration earlier. On the other hand, if the potential reductions turn out to be less promising, we will still strive to meet our LEDS aspiration to the best of our ability even though the task becomes more difficult.So, let me now provide some details of the various programmes.Keeping carbon emissions low from electrical power generation, which currently accounts for 39% of our emissions – that is the yellow sector on the right. This is very important especially as we push for greater electrification of our nation.In October 2019, Minister Chan Chun Sing outlined how we will harness the four supply switches of \"natural gas”, \"solar\", \"regional power grids and \"low carbon alternatives\", together with greater efficiency in energy use on the demand side to accelerate our energy transformation.While we are limited in hydro, wind and nuclear energy, we are pressing ahead with solar deployment. We are significantly accelerating our deployment of solar, from 350 megawatt peak (MWp) by the end of this year, to at least two gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030.To achieve our current goal by the end of this year of 350 MWp, we are deploying solar panels on about one in two HDB rooftops, and in several reservoirs. To achieve two GWp, we will do more. We are deploying off-shore solar farms, and HDB aims to install as many solar panels as feasible on HDB rooftops. As an example, in Pasir Ris town, almost all HDB rooftops will have solar panels by 2030 and deployment is already progressing. Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong will say more about greening our towns in MND'sCOS.Even at such a scale, two GWp of solar power will still only meet around 4% of our current annual electricity needs and 10% of our current peak daily electricity needs. To go significantly beyond this, we need technical breakthroughs, for example, to deploy safe and highly efficient andcost effective solar panels on vertical building surfaces, not just horizontal ones. These building surfaces will only receive solar radiation for part of the day.So, this is why we still need the other three switches to decarbonise our grid. To provide our base load power generation, we had decided early on, in the early 2000s, to switch from fuel oil to natural gas, the cleanest fossil fuel available. Many countries are still highly dependent on coal. We moved away from that in 1956 and we moved to natural gas in the early 2000s. We are exploring tapping regional power grids and studying emerging low or zero-carbon alternatives, such as solar-derived hydrogen to further reduce emissions from power generation.2.00 pmHaving regional power grids is an alternative, but we also have to examine the issues of diversity and resilience. We have diversified the way for piped water and piped natural gas. We should also have diversity when we are considering piped electricity.For industries with sizeable electricity consumption, the progressive decarbonisation of our power grid will help to reduce emissions. But we will also need to reduce emissions all across our economy.The industry sector at 60% is our largest contributor to carbon emissions. We will work closely with industry to make the necessary adjustments, capture new business opportunities and build up their competitive advantage in this transition. We want to be at the forefront of the global move towards environmentally sustainable production and seize the new opportunities this creates.Our industries produce not just for Singapore but also to meet the needs of the global market. We will work with our industries so that they are known to be among the best-in-class in global energy and carbon efficiency as we produce for the rest of the world.Last year, we enhanced our grant schemes to help companies improve their energy efficiency. We are also going beyond individual companies to bring companies together to achieve systems-level efficiency gains. We are also working with industry and our research community to study new technologies such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) and low-carbon hydrogen to evaluate and plan the next steps for Singapore.The carbon tax, which we have introduced, will collect roughly $1 billion over the first five years. We intend to invest more than that into helping our companies adapt, move and transform for a low-carbon future.In urban transportation, we are already a global pioneer in limiting vehicle population and reducing traffic congestion. Major investments in public transport and active mobility infrastructure will pave the way for nine in 10 of all peak period journeys to be made using \"Walk, Cycle, Ride\" transport modes by 2040.These policies tackle the urban transport issue systemically, not just individual pieces of it. We tackle this issue at its root. This is where most of the gains in energy and carbon efficiency are reaped. But we will also move towards enhancing the overall carbon efficiency of our urban transport through large-scale adoption of green vehicles.As announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng, we will phase out internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040 and have all vehicles running on cleaner energy. MEWR and MND will say more about how we will provide incentives and lay the enabling charging infrastructure to achieve this.These efforts will make a significant difference, but how quickly they can be realised depends on technological advancements and how quickly manufacturers can bring attractive,cost-efficient electrical vehicles to the market.Our commercial and residential buildings are also major users of energy. Since the launch of the Green Mark Scheme in 2005, we have greened more than 40% of our buildings by gross floor area. We will push on to achieve our goal to green 80% of our buildings by 2030 and beyond that, we aim to increase the number of buildings that are even more energy efficient.All of us have a part to play. We have introduced minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) and mandatory energy labelling (MELS) for common household appliances. By purchasing more efficient appliances, consumers save on their energycosts while reducing emissions. This is truly win-win.With all our light bulbs as energy efficient as LED bulbs from 2023, our households will save about $3.5 million annually in energycosts and reduce carbon emissions by around 6.3 million kilo-tonnes annually. Just by this step alone, we can save money and reduce carbon emissions. MEWR and MND will provide more details.Miss Cheng Li Hui, Mr Pritam Singh and Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked how Singapore is contributing to international efforts on climate change.Singapore will do our utmost to work with the international community to tackle climate change. We need effective international cooperation. Every country must do its part or the efforts of each country will be nullified.Singapore works actively in international forums to strengthen consensus among countries, especially at a time when the multilateral system is under strain. Singapore is often called upon as a constructive and trusted interlocutor to help forge solutions for difficult issues at international climate negotiations.For example, Minister Masagos Zulkifli played key roles in co-facilitating the topic of mitigation at COP-24 in Katowice in 2018 and the key outcomes of the climate negotiations in Madrid last December. We look forward to working closely with the United Kingdom, who will be hosting COP-26 in Glasgow this November.We are also well positioned to support abatement efforts globally. As a major maritime and aviation hub, we work actively with the International Maritime Organization and International Civil Aviation Organization to address international transport emissions. These are counted separately from national emissions. MOT will share more details later.Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about green financing. As a leading financial centre, we aim to be a green finance hub to spur investments in low-carbon solutions and drive climate action.MAS recently established a US$2 billion green investments programme to anchor green activities of asset managers in Singapore and support the mainstreaming of green finance. MAS also collaborated with the industry to develop environmental risk management guidelines. These guidelines will set standards on governance, risk management and disclosure, and encourage the right-pricing of loans and investments to promote new green investments. MAS will issue the guidelines for public consultation in March 2020.I think Mr Saktiandi Supaat will be happy to know that our three local banks have stopped funding regional coal fired power plant projects and all three of them are very active in financing regional alternative energy projects such as solar power.Through our Research Innovation and Enterprise 2020 plan, we are investing close to $1 billion in urban solutions and sustainability in areas such as new urban mobility solutions and a next-generation energy grid. As a \"living lab\", we will continue to serve as a test-bed for innovative solutions that can be exported globally.Singapore also collaborates actively with international partners such as the UNFCCC and ASEAN to build capabilities and share experiences. Since 1992, Singapore has trained more than 130,000 officials from fellow developing countries under the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) in key areas such as sustainable development, urban planning, water and transport management.While Singapore's efforts to reduce emissions on our own may be modest, our collective efforts with all nations can be substantial.Mr Chairman, for small-island nations like Singapore, climate change poses an asymmetrical challenge. On the one hand, our impact on global emissions is small, but on the other hand, the effect of climate change on us is disproportionately large and indeed, existential.We must thus plan seriously for the real prospect that sea levels will rise by up to one metre by 2100 – in line with what climate science is telling us. We need to implement these adaptation plans to protect our country and people, and we cannot rely on anyone else to do this for us. We are already taking action.In 2011, we raised the platform level for all reclamation projects by an additional one metre, from three metres to four metres above the Singapore Height Datum (SHD). The highest tide ever recorded in Singapore is about two metres above the SHD. Raising the level from three metres to four metres gives us an additional one metre of clearance and gives us a two-metre buffer, so that if sea levels rise by one metre, we still have one metre left.For key new facilities such as Changi Airport Terminal 5, we are raising the platform level even higher, to at least five metres above the SHD.The Marina Barrage, which was completed in 2008, already provides some flood protection for our city, but we are planning to see whether we can raise that further and even increase the size of the pumps.Protecting ourselves from sea level rise is a large-scale and long-term effort requiring considerable resources. Our assessments and plans are based on studies which have been commissioned by the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change over the past several years.In his National Day Rally last year, Prime Minister Lee outlined the threats from sea level rise and our plans estimating that this willcost $100 billion over the next 100 years. Deputy Prime Minister Heng announced in the Budget a new Coastal and Flood Protection Fund, with an initial top-up of $5 billion to start setting aside the resources that we will need for this.We have divided our coastal areas into hydraulically-distinct segments to study different options for each area. We will now develop these studies into detailed plans and phase in our coastal protection measures.We must start implementing our plans and be prepared to adjust and adapt them according to the latest sea level rise projections. The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources will say more about this in hisCOS.Mr Chairman, Sir, I have just outlined our whole-of-Government strategy for climate action, which is considered, committed and collective. The relevant Ministries will provide more details on specific plans under their charge.But as Mr Seah Kian Peng has highlighted, this is a collective effort. We need all Singaporeans – Government, individuals, households and businesses – all of us, to do our part and work together as a whole of nation.As part of Singapore Together, the Government will create more partnership opportunities for Singaporeans to advance climate action. So let us work together to secure the future of Singapore as a climate-resilient nation – with a competitive economy, sustainable environment, an environmentally responsible and active citizenry, and a good quality of life for all.Overall Population StrategiesDr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang): Mr Chairman, according to the Department of Statistics, Singapore's total population stands at 5.703 million as of 2019. This is a 1.2% increase from the previous year. The number of Singapore citizens is 3.5 million and the number of Permanent Residents is 525,000. There is a slight increase of 0.8% and 0.6% respectively. What is worrisome is the decline of old-age support ratio from 4.8 in 2018 to 4.5 in 2019. It means that we only have 4.5 residents who are between 20 and 64 years for every resident who is 65 and above.What is the Government doing to increase or at least to maintain our Singapore citizens' numbers? Can we do more to support young families and encourage more Singaporean families to have more babies? What is the Government doing to slow down the increase of old-age support ratio?Immigration has for a very long time been a touchy issue, not only in Singapore but many other countries as well. Generally, most Singaporeans accept that immigration can contribute certain expertise that is lacking in Singapore. Many of them chose to make Singapore their home and become citizens. They take their pledge at citizenship ceremonies that are held across different constituencies.2.15 pmA survey by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) released at the National Integration Council (NIC) Convention last August, showed that many Singaporeans feel that immigrants can do more to integrate into Singapore. This survey covered about 4,000 Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents. Six out of 10 of the respondents felt that the immigrants were not doing enough to integrate. Is there any study or survey on our new citizens on how they feel above their new citizenship journey? Do they feel adequately integrated by our programmes? Can we do more to make them be more integrated? What is the Government doing to further enhance the integration of new citizens into our society and our communities?Population Plans and IntegrationMr Pritam Singh: Sir, Singapore's economic circumstances and multiracial meritocracy are unique features of our country. While Finance Minister's Budget speeches in this term of government focused consistently on security, economy, society and Singaporeans, we know that our evolving population policies are existential to the future of the Singapore Core. The vast majority of residents are permanently invested in this country and do not have the luxury of imagining a home away from Singapore and nor would we have it that way.Sir, the total fertility numbers are weakening with the Budget book estimating the number for FY2020 to hover around 1.1 to 1.2. However, the population in brief 2019 data released by the PMO Strategy Group reveals that the TFR number for the Chinese and Indian residents has fallen to around 0.98 and 1 respectively, compared to 1.14 and 1.19 a decade ago. The same document, however, records an encouraging rise in the TFR for the Malay community. From a high of 1.91 in 2008, the number fell to 1.66 in 2013, before steadily and consistently moving up to 1.85 in 2018.Has the PMO team assessed the policy reasons behind this upturn for the Malay community and are there insights that can be highlighted or even ported to the other communities?Similarly, the latest data also records a rise in the number of citizen ever married females deciding to have no children, or only one child compared to 10 years ago. Likewise, the proportion of married females with three children or more has fallen considerably over the same period. Fortunately, most ever married citizen females who have two children has hovered around the 43% mark similar to 10 years ago. While the decision to have children or no children is a deeply personal one and one that we must respect, what new strategies and plans does the PMO have to push couples or encourage couples to have at least two or more children?Has the Government engaged couples who have only one child to find out what their key concerns are? I believe work-life balance,costs of living concerns have been raised previously as major impediments. It would be important to see what more can be done in this area with buy-in from private sector employers. After all, without a thriving Singapore Core, it is hard to foresee a thriving and confident Singapore.Sir, as previously announced by the Government, our population plans and policies are due for review this year. Numbers aside, the Government needs to take a re-look at our integration efforts. Permanent Residents (PRs) and foreigners who we hope will take up citizenship are connected through technology to their motherlands more so than earlier generation of immigrants. And therefore, integration may not just take more time, but may not be as linear as previously imagined with schools and institutions such as National Service our major agents of adhesion.In addition, as alluded to by Minister Chan recently, unlike in the past, even in the economic realm, Singapore may not be able to attract the quality of individuals it seeks. Does this anticipate some changes to our population plans with a desire to attract immigrants from further afield, specifically non-traditional countries classified as others, which currently account for about 6.3% of Singapore citizenships and PRs granted in 2018, as compared to 62.5% from Southeast Asian countries and 31.2% from Asian countries.What shifts in our population strategies is the Government planning so as to deal with the new challenges in supplementing our population through immigration?Has the Government conducted surveys of new citizens over the last 10 to 20 years, for us to have a better perspective on how we can improve integration.Finally, Sir, can the Government share how many PRs have transited to become citizens over the last 10 years and 20 years respectively, and how many choose to remain PRs? What are the their main reasons for not transiting to citizenship?Supporting Marriage and Parenthood (M&P)Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee): Chairman, this is Clare. She is 17 days old today. A wonderful bundle of joy. She is our fourth child and our first daughter. Each time the experience is the same. Having lost two of our six children, Peter and Maria, to miscarriages, every time we go through a pregnancy we have an equal measure of worry and joy. Each time our gynecologist says, \"She’s doing fine\", we let out a sigh of relief.Clare's birth has changed our lives, just as her three older brothers have. The home is a little bit noisier, the floor is, of course, a lot messier and sleep is now even more a luxury commodity at home – but more importantly, the immeasurable joy of parenthood.I do not wish to glamourise parenthood. Like everything else, it comes with its own burdens. But Jocelyn and I believe that it is a burden worth carrying. At the same time, I wish the burden were lighter, not so much with benefits, but for society to be able to reinforce a culture that recognises the family as important.My wife is a stay-at-home mother. For our three older boys, she took care of them herself without any help. And often, I am asked, \"What does your wife work as\"? My reply was that she is a full-time mother often elicits odd responses. They go along the lines of, \"Oh, she is so lucky, she doesn't have to work\", or on the flipside, \"You have to work harder.\" Often enough, I respond quite quickly to those statements, as if to justify our situation; that in addition to her love for our children, she also runs a small online business at home that twins her passions. She sews infant clothing and accessories. But it also hits me after that, that there is no need to justify why my wife stays at home.She, like other stay-at-home mothers, make a conscious decision, that a sacrifice of her career was weighed and that spending time with the children was worth it. A fellow parliamentarian from Europe, whom I have known for a few years was in Singapore for a conference last year. He made an observation, perhaps a little snidely and a little bit snarky, \"The Minister-in-charge of your country's population strategy is the Minister for Manpower? Should it not be the Minister for Family?\"I explained to him that our Minister-in-charge only happens to be the Minister for Manpower. She is also a mother, and also a Cabinet Minister, who is deeply passionate about children.But there might be a small grain of truth. Often, we couch our policies on families with the view on our workforce, our dependency ratio, so much so that our culture has been shaped by that; that the true joy and happiness of family is clouded by numbers.So, I urge as I have, in the last three years; for us a return to basics, that we ask ourselves beyond policies, beyond benefits, how can the whole of society help to build a family-friendly culture that is supportive of families in Singapore, that allows stay-at-home mothers to be proud of what they do? And also mothers who choose to continue their careers to have the support that they require.That said, I also wish that we level the playing field and recognise fully the role of mothers. Whether in or outside of employment, mothers play an important role in our society. So, in all our non-tax related benefits such as for early childhood education subsidies, child relief amongst others, I hope that we can have more equity between working and non-working mothers. There will be some benefits that we will need to segregate and have some amount of additional help for those who have children but have decided to go back into the workforce but the rest, especially, benefits for the children should be equalised.Mr Chairman, families are the backbone of society. If we do not take care of this backbone, we will not be able to stand straight and strong as a country.Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah): Marriage and parenthood can be a joyful journey. Yes, there are challenges, but the joy of bringing up children is fulfilling and lasting. Last year, the Government conducted public consultations on the needs and concerns relevant to marriage and parenthood. Some areas that are often talked of are flexible work arrangements, having a conducive work culture, parental leave, and importantly, increased childcare leave and more childcare leave for the mothers and the fathers who have more children.How have the enhancements, provided by the Government, to support marriage and parenthood benefited young Singaporeans and their families? And will there be further enhancements based on feedback received? What measures are we putting in place to encourage an increase in our TFR? Next cut.A Culture of Support for FamiliesYounger Singaporeans may be delaying marriage and parenthood in pursuit of other life goals. Of course, these are very personal choices. But, how can the whole-of-society contribute to building a culture that emphasises the importance and significance of family and, in so doing, foster an environment that is supportive of families in Singapore? This will help also, to promote the desire to have children – a joy for the parents and, also, importantly for our country.Progress of M&P EnhancementsMr Desmond Choo (Tampines): Enhancing marriage and parenthood is critical to addressing our ageing population and low TFR problems. The Government has rolled out important measures such as shortening the time to get housing and defraying child-raisingcosts. How have the enhancements benefited young Singaporeans and what was their feedback, especially from the Citizens Panel?Core to singles not getting married and married couples not having children is the intricate balance between work and family. Having Flexible Work Arrangements can help our families cope better, especially after maternity. The COVID-19 episode has shown that broad-based FWA is possible whereas the previous pre-outbreak thinking was that it simply was not. Would the Government consider granting women on maternity the right to FWA? If businesses could do it for large swathes of the workforce during the outbreak now, certainly allowing 40,000 women to go on FWA each year must be manageable.Providing Childcare Sick LeaveMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): It has been more than a decade since childcare leave provisions were increased and it is time to review this again. There is clearly insufficient childcare leave provided. Will PMO consider having specific childcare sick leave and providing this on a per child basis?The Public Service, already gives officers childcare sick leave and it is on a per child basis. If Government clearly feels that childcare sick leave is important for people who work for us, then why not important for the people we serve? Let us level that playing field.Family-friendly WorkplaceMs Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong): Many of us spend a large part of our day, and in fact, our lives at work. It is therefore important for both our mental and physical well-being that there is a healthy culture at the workplace environment. Social norms and the workplace culture can impact Singaporeans' decisions on important issues like marriage, having children and career progression.One of the key challenges faced by parents with young children is managing their work and family responsibilities. If they find this too challenging, they may not want to have more children. On the other hand, we must also ensure that those who are single at the workplace, are not the ones having to pick up the workload of their colleagues who have children, because this may prevent them from having opportunities to have relationships and eventually marry. Some singles may also have elderly parents to care for and need the flexibility to take some time to perhaps bring their parents to check-ups.I am grateful for the Government's efforts in giving out the Work-Life Grant and in encouraging employers to adopt Flexible-Work Arrangements, but I believe we would all like to see the adoption of such arrangements to be more pervasive.I am happy to learn that last year, the Government convened a Citizen's Panel of Work-Life Harmony. It was indicated that the Government would seriously study the recommendations. How will the Government be following up on the Panel's recommendations, and how can employers and other stakeholders play a bigger role in implementing solutions to make workplaces more family-friendly?Youth Aspirations and Work-life BalanceThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs and National Development (Ms Sun Xueling): The Citizens Panel was convened to gather views from Singaporeans from all walks of life on how work life harmony can be strengthened in Singapore and how a more supportive societal a workplace culture can be created that is family-friendly.2.30 pmGiven that youths will shape the future workplace culture of Singapore, what has been the feedback from youths from the Citizens' Panel on how they see work-life balance? Have they shared how they can balance pursuing their aspirations with starting a family and how they see society supporting them in achieving this balance?In recent conversations with youths, some have shared their interest to work and study overseas. The Government is also promoting this, so that youths have a wider perspective and can also gain international experience which is extremely helpful in their careers and personal development. How do youths reconcile the internationalisation message with settling down with a family in Singapore?The Chairman: Minister Josephine Teo.The Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo): Thank you, Mr Chairman. I appreciate the views and suggestions of Members on matters concerning our population.Our policies aim to help Singapore maintain a stable population, to keep our society cohesive, our economy vibrant, and our nation strong. Population policies are not just for today, but tomorrow. We are always thinking about future generations of Singaporeans.I will focus on two areas: first, making Singapore a great place for families; second, integrating immigrants into our Singapore community.We aim, first and foremost, to support young Singaporeans to get married and become parents.Similar to most developed economies, our total fertility rate is below replacement – at 1.14 for last year and the year before. Globally, many countries are like Singapore, where birth rates have been declining since the 1970s. Some Nordic countries that had previously reversed the decline, have seen birth rates falling again in recent years.However, there are some positive signs in Singapore. The average number of citizen births in the last five years is higher than previous five-year periods. From 2015 to 2019, we had around 33,000 births annually. This is higher than the average from 2010 to 2014, of around 32,000 births annually. I believe Mr Alex Yam, Mr Desmond Choo, Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Louis Ng, Ms Rahayu Mahzam and also Ms Sun Xueling, perhaps Mr Pritam Singh as well, all contributed to this. Thank you very much. Please keep going.On top of this, as some Singaporeans live overseas, we welcomed about 1,600 Singaporean babies born overseas each year, over the past five years. This is also higher than the average in previous five-year periods. So, to Ms Sun Xueling's question, it is not incompatible – your overseas ambitions and raising a family – this can be done.Similarly, the average number of citizen marriages in the last five years is higher than previous five-year periods.I hope these positive trends will continue as more young Singaporeans enter their prime marriage and parenthood ages. But we will need to continue tackling the factors that shape marriage and parenthood decisions – together, not just as a Government, but as one Singapore.At the Committee of Supply debate last year, I indicated that we would embark on a consultation process, to better understand Singaporeans’ needs and concerns around forming families. The aim was to move beyond feedback and suggestions, to work with fellow Singaporeans on practical ways to address marriage and parenthood issues. This is what the Singapore Together movement is all about. We are heartened that many Singaporeans stepped forward to take part.We launched a series of online polls, inviting Singaporeans to give suggestions on how to better support young families. As Mr Christopher de Souza and Ms Sun Xueling mentioned, Singaporeans believe that making Singapore a great place for families requires partnerships across society. At home, most Singaporeans viewed parenting as a shared responsibility between spouses. At the workplace, Singaporeans felt that having supportive bosses and understanding colleagues were critical factors that enabled them to meet their work and family commitments. Respondents also raised concerns about thecost of having children.We have listened carefully to their views. Last year, we announced significant enhancements to support young families. With your permission, Mr Chairman, may I ask the Clerks to distribute a booklet showing the key marriage and parenthood benefits today?The Chairman: Yes, please.Mrs Josephine Teo: Mr Chairman, Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Desmond Choo asked how these enhancements have benefited young Singaporean families. Let me elaborate on three major moves.First, couples can now more easily enrol their child in an affordable and good quality pre-school. We have increased the amount of pre-school subsidies, and made them available to even more families. Today, after subsidies, a working couple who earn a combined $5,000 a month, pays $130 per month per child for full-day childcare at an Anchor Operator pre-school. This is about a third of what they would have paid previously.To ensure that quality pre-schools are accessible to all families, we have kept fees affordable at all Government-supported pre-schools; fee caps for Partner Operator preschools will also come down next year.In addition, ECDA has been growing the number of pre-school places. By around 2025, eight in 10 pre-schoolers can have a place in a Government-supported preschool, up from just over five in 10 today.In the medium term, we aim to make full-day childcare at Government-supported pre-schools as affordable as thecost of Primary school plus afterschool student care. This is not even including the means-tested pre-school subsidies, which will allow low- and middle income families to pay even less. At the same time, we will ensure good quality learning and care across all pre-schools. These are significant steps that we are taking, to ensure that we continue to give every Singaporean child a good start in life.Second, housing is now more affordable for newly married couples. We have heard couples’ feedback on the importance of getting their own home before starting a family. We have made it faster for them to get a BTO flat. HDB has launched more than 3,600 BTO flats with shorter waiting times. The wait of about two and a half years is shorter than the usual three to four years.Couples can also more easily own a flat with the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG). First-timer families now receive up to $80,000 in grants when purchasing a new HDB flat, and up to $160,000 when purchasing an HDB resale flat. Since its inception, about 1,000 first-timer families have benefited from the Enhanced Housing Grant.In addition, the income ceiling was raised. More couples are able to purchase subsidised HDB flats and Executive Condominiums.Third, we improved the affordability of healthcare for children, and fertility treatments.By the end of this year, every Singaporean child will enjoy subsidies for all nationally recommended childhood vaccinations and developmental screenings, at polyclinics as well as CHAS GP clinics. The Minister for Health will share more details at MOH's Committee of Supply debate.We have also enhanced Government co-funding for assisted conception procedures, to better support couples who need them.These enhancements reinforce our strong support for marriage and parenthood in Singapore. They have also been well-received by many Singaporeans.Ms Rahayu Mahzam was concerned that many Singaporeans find it a challenge to balance work and family. Mr Christopher de Souza asked whether there would be further enhancements based on feedback received.We have been working on ways to help families achieve better harmony in work and life, including whether to have longer leave for parents. At present, working couples have a combined total of 20 weeks of paid parental leave and two weeks of unpaid leave in their child’s first year. In addition, each parent receives six days of paid childcare leave annually until their child turns seven, and two days of paid childcare leave until the child turns 12.We announced the three-year Public Sector pilot on Unpaid Infant Care Leave in 2017. The pilot enables public officers to take up to four weeks of Unpaid Infant Care Leave in the first year after their child’s birth. This benefit has been well-received by parents who need it. Their supervisors and colleagues have also been supportive and feel that it has not affected their teams’ productivity. As such, we will formalise it as a permanent HR leave provision within the Public Service. We hope that more private companies will be encouraged by the Public Service’s positive experience, and initiate similar support to their employees.There have been calls from time to time, including from Mr Louis Ng, to further enhance leave schemes for parents. We will continuously review all support measures for parenthood. We had prioritised housing, pre-school and healthcare because these were what young families said mattered most.Of course, when conditions allow, young families would welcome more paid leave being mandated. However, it would be unwise for us to ignore the impact on employers. While the public sector is in a position to do more than current legislation requires, we cannot assume the same for all businesses, especially SMEs which are the single largest group of employers and already facing manpower constraints.In the face of economic uncertainties and the pressure for businesses to transform, tripartite partners are also mindful not to add further to employers' burdens. Instead of imposing higher obligations on all, we will provide greater support to businesses that are able to do more, such as supporting them in implementing flexible work arrangements (FWAs). After all, working parents have consistently given us feedback that flexible work arrangements are key in supporting them to manage work and family commitments. I should add that when companies implement flexible work arrangements, other employees who are not parents also benefit. They tend to feel a greater sense of fairness. For example, if some do not have young children but have elderly parents who, from time to time, have medical appointments that they also need to take them to.As it turns out, a focus on promoting flexible work arrangements was also the preference of the Citizens’ Panel convened last year. The Panel brought together 55 fellow Singaporeans of diverse backgrounds to develop ways to improve work-life harmony in Singapore. I was heartened by their enthusiasm and commitment to build a future Singapore that would be more supportive of work-life harmony.The Panel recommended thoughtful solutions, such as promoting flexible work arrangements and introducing more progressive HR practices. These would help employees, especially those with more care-giving responsibilities, to better juggle their family life and work.Ms Sun Xueling and Mr Desmond Choo will be glad to know that both younger and older Singaporeans in the Panel called for wider societal change to address social norms that affect work-life harmony and for shifts in workplace practices.The Government and tripartite partners fully support the Panel’s intent to create conditions for better work-life harmony, and will do so by \"making it easy\", \"making it known\" and \"making it accepted\". Let me elaborate.\"Making It Easy\". We will introduce new tools and guides to facilitate the adoption of flexible work arrangements and work-life harmony initiatives by employers and employees.\"Making It Known\". We will increase the recognition of employers who adopt flexible work arrangements and work-life initiatives. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Low Yen Ling will provide more details on these moves at MOM's Committee of Supply debate.\"Making It Accepted\". We will work together to shift societal norms and the mindsets of employers, employees and individuals in the larger community. MCCY will provide support through Our Singapore Fund, for Singaporeans who wish to organise meaningful projects that encourage these shifts.I hope these efforts will rally Singaporeans to work together, towards a more family-friendly society.Supporting marriage and parenthood is the Government's top priority for the population. Our policies and enhancements over the years attest to that.However, I agree with Mr Alex Yam that beyond policy, a whole-of-society approach is needed to build a family-friendly Singapore. For instance, when we see parents with young children struggling with their prams in public spaces, do we step forward to lend a helping hand? When a colleague goes on paternity leave, do we say supportive words of encouragement or do we cast aspersions on this necessity? Quite often, it is societal values, workplace and cultural norms that determine whether raising a family is achievable, enjoyable and celebrated.2.45 pmLet me turn now to immigration matters, which Dr Lim Wee Kiak raised. This is a delicate issue in many places around the world.With current birth rates and as our society ages, our citizen population will likely decline. For many years now, we have taken in a carefully controlled number of new citizens each year to keep the citizen population stable over the long term. As immigrants are mostly from younger age groups, this also helps to moderate our pace of ageing.The Government has kept the pace of immigration calibrated, in line with our commitments. Over the past five years, we granted about 22,100 new Singapore citizenships on average each year. We also granted about 31,700 Permanent Residencies on average each year. We have kept the total size of the PR population at around half a million for many years now.It is not easy to become a new citizen or PR. Many applications are rejected. We have high expectations of those who join our community. Newcomers who want to make Singapore their home have the responsibility to adapt to our way of life, and must continue to contribute to our society and economy.One good example is Mr Trieu Dang Huy, who works as a senior projects executive at Singapore Airlines. He has lived in Singapore for 14 years and became a Singapore Citizen last year. When Mr Trieu first moved here, he took it upon himself to learn English, Mandarin and Singlish, so much so that when he speaks now, it is hard to tell that he was originally from Vietnam. Mr Trieu met his wife while studying at NUS. Together, they believe it is important to contribute to society and donate blood regularly. They also have a young son who is Singaporean. Members of this House would know of other examples.Mr Pritam Singh and Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked how we can ensure that newcomers make an effort to to integrate into our society. The National Integration Council is doing a lot of commendable work on this front in the community, workplaces and schools.Let me just highlight one new initiative. As part of the Singapore Together movement, we are inviting Singaporeans to help craft the content for the Singapore Citizenship Journey – a compulsory programme for all who seek to take up Singapore citizenship. I am happy that many have stepped forward. This will complement our existing efforts. For example, the People's Association appoints Integration and Naturalisation Champions to help new citizens and PRs settle into their neighbourhoods. They organise chit-chat sessions, interest groups and learning journeys to nudge newcomers to make new friends and get involved in the community. We continue to welcome Singaporeans' views on how we help newcomers to better integrate into our society.As we start the new decade, the Government remains committed to working with Singaporeans and to keep Singaporeans at the heart of our population policies. Mr Pritam Singh asked for an update on our population outlook. We reviewed this two years ago. As I informed the House then, our total population in 2030 – at the end of this decade – is likely to be significantly below 6.9 million. This remains the case today.Mr Chairman, on population matters, there are no easy solutions but the Government will do its best to chart the way forward that keeps our society cohesive and our economy vibrant. We will always have Singaporeans' best interests at heart, now and in the future, and we will never stop progressing as one united people.Smart Nation Benefits to Citizens and BusinessesMr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer): Mr Chairman, my cut is to ask about the tangible benefits to citizens and local businesses arising from our Smart Nation initiatives.Digitalisation has opened up new possibilities for businesses and for our society. Singapore has been at the forefront of digital transformation since we launched the Smart Nation initiative in November 2014. Today, Singapore is globally recognised as a smart city, with the IMD Smart City Index ranking Singapore as the smartest city in 2019, and several other reputable organisations also place Singapore within the top 10 smart cities globally.But the prestige of being a globally recognised as a \"smart city\" is scant success if our citizens and businesses are unable to reap tangible benefits. Can the Minister share with us how our Smart Nation initiatives have created an efficient and competitive environment for our businesses? Can the Minister also share with us how our Smart Nation policies have engendered inclusiveness and have improved the convenience and quality of interactions with our citizens?Smart TownDr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang): Chairman, Sir, the Smart Nation initiative was first announced by Prime Minister Lee in 2014. It aims to make Singapore into an outstanding city where people live, work and play in an innovation-rich environment.Building a Smart Nation requires a concerted national effort which comprises three pillars: digital Government, digital economy and digital society. As the central coordinating agency for e-Government services, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group has implemented a number of online services to benefit both businesses and our people. These include services pertaining to CPF services, parking, libraries and SkillsFuture.At the town level, I wish to share some initiatives undertaken by the PAP Town Councils to support Smart Nation initiatives and to seek support from the Government to expedite the implementation of Smart Town technologies and features to benefit three million HDB residents.Over the years, the PAP Town Councils have developed and implemented various IT and digital solutions to better serve our residents. These include, first, the computerisation of our financial system known as the Town Council Management System (TCMS) which integrates our system with those of various Government agencies, banks and service providers.Second, the computerisation and digitisation of our Complaint Management System called the Integrated Estate Management System (IEMS) which collects feedback from residents and stakeholders for maintenance and improvement purposes. To support this objective, we have also developed the iTown mobile application for residents to provide feedback on Town Council matters and a dashboard management system for IEMS.Third, a telemonitoring system (TMS) for the monitoring of lift breakdowns and also a lift performance dashboard management system to monitor and improve the reliability and safety of 24,000 lifts in the 15 PAP Town Councils.In addition, Holland-Bukit Panjang Town Council has embarked on a number of Smart Town initiatives to improve township management services for residents. For example, we have digitalised over 90 blocks of our flats using Building Information Modelling (BIM) to build a digital database of as-built drawings to facilitate and augment maintenance and improvement works. We have developed a Smart BFA application to enable users of Personal Mobility Aids to navigate Barrier Free Access routes and facilities in Bukit Panjang Town. We are also exploring other smart town features, such as smart locks, for roof access, e-procurement and payment and sensors for improving lift performance.Sir, at this point, I wish to ask the Minister to update the House on the progress of Smart Nation initiatives and to call for more support for the implementation of smart technologies in our HDB towns.Smart Lamp PostsMr Pritam Singh: Sir, it was previously reported in the media that in the last quarter of 2018 that Singapore Technologies Engineering had won a $7.5 million tender for the \"Lamp Posts as Platform\" project to \"fit lamp posts here with sensors and cameras that can collect a wide range of citizen surveillance data\".The new camera system was able to analyse faces down the race, gender and age, and a trial was to be held at one-north and Geylang before the project could potentially be extended to more than 100,000 lamp posts in Singapore.Sir, there has been a wide range of feedback, both on the upside and downside potential of the Smart Nation Sensor Platform with different countries and jurisdictions taking different views of the problem. In fact, some jurisdictions, like San Francisco, have banned such smart technologies. Other than seriously looking at how best to balance and manage the privacy concerns that accompany such platforms. On the flipside, in light of manpower constraints and the prospect for effective monitoring and deterrence – the public's difficult relationship with some users of PMDs come to mind – the benefits of these new technologies are readily apparent.We have also read about rogue public officers, including Police officers, illegally accessing Government information in our newspapers in the past. While these numbers are very small, new technologies and smart platforms host so much more information and data of a personal nature that people can lose confidence and trust in public service very quickly should an untoward incident occur. There is also the attendant risk of cybersecurity incidents.It has been two-and-a-half years since the Prime Minister announced details on the Smart Nation digital platform at the 2017 National Day Rally. What have been the results of the pilot so far not just from the technical data acquisition perspective but the processing, handling and control perspective? Is it the PMO's view that our data protection laws are fit for purpose to accommodate the advent of these new technologies which have significant repercussions on individual privacy?Smart Nation and Data SecurityMr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio): Mr Chairman, the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has transformed the way we collect, store and use data. It has heralded in an era characterised by the blurring of digital and physical boundaries, and the growing use of new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, robotics, 3D printing and the Internet of Things (IoT).In the push for a Smart Nation, the Singapore Government, through GovTech, has introduced various initiatives to streamline the provision of Government services online and through digital platforms. While we have been making steady progress towards realising the vision of a Smart Nation Singapore, the complexity and amount of data that the Government has to manage has also increased correspondingly.In recent years, we have seen several instances where Government data was compromised. In 2019 alone, two high profile breaches were surfaced where medical data of individuals were leaked online. First, the personal information of more than 14,200 HIV-positive individuals and there was also a case of a loophole in the HSA's system resulting in the compromise of data that affected more than 800,000 blood donors.Clearly, data security is everyone's business. I understand the Public Sector Data Security Review Committee (PSDSRC) has submitted a slew of recommendations to the Government last November and the Government has accepted those recommendations, which are to be fully implemented by 2023. Can the Government provide an update on the action plan to implement the recommendations, and how is the Government ensuring robust data security, even as it uses data more extensively?Smart Nation and Digital GovernmentMr Vikram Nair (Sembawang): Mr Chairman, Singapore's Government is leading by example in making Singapore a Smart Nation, with more and more Government agencies providing services online and more and more services being automated.One good example is immigration. One is able to apply for passports online and collect with minimal fuss. Clearing immigration is also automated for Singaporeans at the various checkpoints, making clearance a breeze.Filling out taxes is a painful process in many places, but, here, for most people, it is just a few clicks on an online system and our tax form for the year is done.As an NSman, a reservist, it has become increasingly easy to get things done, including going for medical check-ups, taking the IPPT and even acknowledging call-ups.So, as service users, life for us has become very easy, so much so that we may even take it for granted. Some of us even followed this example. For this speech, for example, I am actually using my smartphone, rather than the paper I normally use. So, we are all trying to go smart.But, of course, we recognise this requires significant state resources. What is the Government doing to build up public sector capabilities in harnessing digitalisation? And how can it ensure that it is able to attract enough engineers and people of the right calibre to develop these systems?National Artificial Intelligence (AI) ProjectMr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol): Chairman, I am a heavy user of technology. And when I started on a technology project, I created a first layer of programming and algorithm where the machines started to learn. With more data collected, more and more, the machine gets smarter and it could make intelligent decisions or informed decisions for me. As it goes on, I realise that some of my staff actually were being replaced for the role that they played but they could co-exist with the technology itself, and I realise that that is artificial intelligence (AI).AI was extremely helpful for the companies that I run. The staff themselves found that they could co-exist and become more productive and more clever in making the decisions. I am excited about the national AI project and I hope that the national AI project is not just internally focused, but externally focused as well.As long as it enables and strengthens companies and individuals and help Singaporeans in their daily lives, I think this AI Project will be very exciting instead of replacing jobs.3.00 pmGovernment-to-Business (G2B) Processes for Smart NationMr Ong Teng Koon: Mr Chairman, businesses are often faced with processes that require approvals from multiple Government agencies. This is time-consuming and expensive for businesses when they have to make physical visits to different agencies, provide similar information repeatedly on separate application forms and track the status of applications on different agency portals. It could become frustrating when business owners uncover additional regulatory requirements that they were unaware of, resulting in delays to their application process. I would like to ask the Minster what is the Government doing to streamline such G2B processes and if there an ongoing dialogue with businesses to review the current G2B processes and identify their pain points.With the launch of the GoBusiness Licensing Portal by GovTech in October 2019, business owners in the food industry now experience a seamless application process that requires only one form with 90 data fields instead of 14 forms with 845 data fields. I would like to ask the Minster what is the reduction tocost, time and effort for business owners from this successful process optimisation and if this has reduced the total application fees paid by businesses. Also, what are the future plans on the roll-out of the integrated licensing portal to other industries? What will be the expected savings from these efforts?Currently, GovTech has launched the GoBusiness Licensing Portal and the Business Grants Portal. Can the Minster advise if are there other touchpoints with businesses that will be streamlined?The Chairman: Ms Tin Pei Ling, take your two cuts together.Smart Nation for CitizensMs Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson): There has been tremendous effort to implement measures to realise our aspirations of a digital economy, Government and society. Apart from blueprints and action frameworks, basic \"building blocks\", such as MyInfo, on which personalised services and applications can be built are in place.We have experienced applications, such as OneService, Parking.SG and Moments of Life, offering conveniences to citizens as we go about our daily lives. Moments of Life, for example, allows me to monitor what vaccinations my two sons have specifically taken and will have to take coming up.As the Government presses on, what new Smart Nation initiatives are there to deliver more personalised and inclusive services to citizens of all ages and of all backgrounds?Could we enhance citizen autonomy and interactions with the Government by digitalising some of the functions or decisions we take in the community? For example, instead of just giving feedback, enhancing the OneService to allow citizens to vote on Home Improvement Programmes or the colour schemes for their block during the cyclical Repair and Redecorations?Our Government probably has an application for anything somewhere. But it would perhaps make better sense to consolidate and streamline so that citizens are clear about where to go for what. Or simply, just go to one platform for everything they need.Partnering Citizens for Smart NationIn the course of our constituency work, we would have observed that, within the community, there are many ideas and resources. For example, we have multiple VWOs and informal volunteer groups, all of which have lion-hearted volunteers who want to do more for our people.In MacPherson, the creation of the MacPherson Cares app is an example. Amongst the many things we hope to achieve, we wanted to draw the volunteers into a central pool and seniors can tap on them for requests as simple as helping them to read letters.In our drive towards a Smart Nation, the Government's effort alone is not enough. Hence, I would like to ask how can the Government better partner citizens in the co-creation of Smart Nation? Could the Government give an update on the use of Our Singapore Fund for Digital Readiness so far?What are some of the fruits of our labour in cultivating digitally ready citizens?Safer Banking for Elderly and AllMr Png Eng Huat (Hougang): Sir, the number of scams involving e-commerce loan, credit-for-sex and impersonation rose by 83.5% last year.The Chairman: Mr Png, my apologies. Dr Vivian will give his reply. Your cut will be after that.The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan): Sorry, if you do not mind. Minister Ong could answer your points. Mr Chair, we are four minutes behind. So, I am going to rush.When COVID broke upon us, you may have noticed that apps like MaskGoWhere or even the gov.sg Whatsapp channel were up and running almost overnight, literally within days. I think you all know that this is only possible because, over the last couple of years, we have assiduously built up the talent and the capability. And this is one clear and present example where it has enabled us to do things quickly, in an agile way and in a way that matters for real life.I want to assure Mr Cedric Foo that we are exquisitely conscious that Smart Nation has to benefit citizens in tangible ways. We have reorganised our services around the needs of citizens, we have made it easier and faster for citizens to access all Government services. A prime example I would cite is Moments of Life (MOL) app. When this app first started, we were aiming to enable parents to quickly register their child’s birth and apply for the Baby Bonus that Minister Josephine Teo was providing and to reduce the time that parents needed to apply for this. By having this app, we estimated we are able to reduce the total waiting time and all that from 60 minutes to 15 minutes.Last year, I shared that 2,000 births had been registered through this app. A year on, this number has increased tenfold, now almost 20,000. I think Minister Teo will appreciate that it is much easier to improve productivity in apps than it is the Total Fertility Rate. Nevertheless, we are trying to facilitate matters. In September 2019, MOL was expanded to serve the needs of our seniors as well and MOH will elaborate on this in itsCOS.As we expand the suite of services we provide through MOL, we will continue to improve the app through constant user testing and citizen engagement.The Smart Nation has to be about solving problems innovatively in both simple and complex issues. We introduced the concept of a digital medical certificate (MC) in 2018. If you think about it, it should be easier to submit and to keep records for digital MCs. It saves paper and time. We first tested this at the National Heart Centre. The GovTech team worked with the healthcare practitioners in the Heart Centre to improve the pilot solution, before rolling it out to more places. Today, we have issued over 400,000 digital MCs for all patients who visit SingHealth hospitals or polyclinics. We will be expanding this to other hospitals and clinics, in particular, into the private sector, starting with Raffles Medical and Mount Alvernia Hospital.I agree with Mr Teo Ser Luck and Mr Ong Teng Koon that building a Smart Nation should also help businesses to succeed in this digital era. Over the past few years, we made it easier for businesses to transact digitally with the Government through the various initiatives like the IPOS Go app and Business Grants Portal. We are extending our support for businesses to help them through their different phases – from starting up a business, to seizing opportunities to grow, to running it more efficiently on a day-to-day basis.To give you an example, we launched the GoBusiness Licensing portal in October 2019, using the customer journey approach, to help F&B businesses start. Some of you may know that, in fact, applying for the right licence to start a business – and, in particular, the F&B business – can be an extremely onerous process – 14 different licences and 800-over fields to fill.When we launched the portal for the F&B processes, we were able to simplify not only the application process but, more importantly, the back-end re-engineering and that would save time and, ultimately, increase the opportunities for them to get online and to conduct their business instantly.I agree with Mr Lim Swee Say and Mr Teo Ser Luck that artificial intelligence should be one of Singapore’s key strengths. If you think about the transition from having computing power in the 1980s to connectivity in the 1990s, today, the fact that computer systems can now engage in pattern recognition, whether it is facial recognition, speech or hearing, this is transformative. And in the same way that computing and communication were made available to all, we need to make this ability available to everyone – people and businesses.That is why we have to embark on our own National AI Strategy for Singapore and I give you this commitment that we are working with companies and the research community to focus our efforts on deploying AI. I want to emphasise the word here is \"deployment\" because we will never have the oceans of data that China has, or the depth and unique ecosystem that Silicon Valley has. But I think we have a niche when it comes to deployment, especially in areas where we already have a competitive advantage, for instance, healthcare, education, logistics, Smart City, Urban Solutions and security.We are also putting in place ecosystem enablers to facilitate this AI deployment across the board. This includes making it easier for companies to adopt AI solutions and we have programmes like SMEsGoDigital and AI Singapore’s 100 Experiments programme and these are available to the private sector.We will continue to take a human-centric approach to AI to bring tangible benefits to citizens and businesses – and I am trying to address Mr Singh's point here – whilst putting in place a strong AI governance structure to ensure that these new fangled abilities are used responsibly, the risks are managed appropriately and public trust is maintained.To ensure benefits to citizens and businesses are widespread and sustained, we have also invested heavily in digital infrastructure at the national level. There is a lot of behind-the-scenes work, often unnoticed and under-appreciated. But, like physical infrastructure, these are fundamental to our ongoing digital transformation.Let me give you one example. The National Digital Identity (NDI) – this is one piece of digital infrastructure that most people would probably not have heard of. But you would have heard of SingPass Mobile. We launched it one-and-a-half years ago. Today, it has close to one million users. It has enabled us to make it easy and secure to verify identity and I am sure many Members of this House have used SingPass for a variety of log-ons in order to use Government services.For example, since CPF launched its online nomination service in January, over 9,000 CPF members and their witnesses have used it to complete the entire process online, securely and conveniently. Mind you, in the past, it would require you to go down to the branch with your witnesses and beneficiaries, sign in front of someone. Now, with the NDI system and Government systems online, you can do all these entirely online but securely because of the NDI system. Businesses have also used this NDI system to innovate and to raise the quality of their own digital services which are provided to customers at large. For instance, online retailers like Carousell who have promoted users as verified buyers or sellers when they sign up using MyInfo, thereby building up trust in online transactions and the marketplace. Businesses also report saving up to $50 per transaction and processing transactions five times faster when their customers use MyInfo to prefill forms. I should have explained MyInfo is basically linked to the NDI so that people do not have to repeatedly fill forms. As long as I have verified that online user, a carefully curated set of information which the user authorises is then made available to that business.Apart from Digital Identity, we have also made significant improvements in digital payment infrastructure, to support more use cases and to make sure it remains inter-operable and competitive. Today, over three-quarters of Singaporeans between the age of 20 and 75 years are registered with PayNow. Monthly transaction volumes nearly doubled over the course of last year, from 4.2 million to 8.1 million transactions.We are using PayNow more pervasively in our Government services and we are seeing high take-up rates. For instance, last year, 20,000 CPF members conducted over 90,000 CPF withdrawals using PayNow, which amounted to over $600 million being transferred almost instantly, in real time.3.15 pmThrough these efforts, citizens' and businesses' satisfaction rates have gone up – you know that we conduct regular surveys on this. We discovered that there has been an 8%-point increase from 2018 to 2019. Currently, those who are indicating satisfaction with Government digital services has gone up to about 86% and 77% respectively. These are the highest scores since we started measuring them in 2012.I say this not to blow our trumpets but to tell people that we are focused on the citizen's experience and on making sure we deliver real value to citizens. We will continue to improve digital services for both citizens and businesses.At the last count, we have about 100 Government apps. I do not take joy in that number, because citizens often tell me, \"There is so many. Which one do I use?\"To remedy this, we will systematically streamline the number of apps and our digital offerings. For a start, we will improve and re-organise the Moments of Life (MOL) app, which I described just now, with the eventual aim of personalising it for each user, as Ms Tin Pei Ling had suggested.If you think about it, we may all carry smartphones but everybody's home screen is unique. That is what individualisation, customisation is. And in a sense, the question is not the number of apps but whether those apps are customised and are suitable for you. Citizens will soon be able to access common Government services on Moments of Life like managing taxes and CPF matters, or even to make event bookings.These processes will continue to be reviewed and as I said – do not pay attention to the number of apps, pay attention to whether it meets your needs and more importantly, whether at the back-end, the Government is using this as an opportunity to re-engineer our processes to be more efficient, to be morecost-effective and to be more responsive.For businesses, we will be extending the user-centric approach that we have taken in setting up the GoBusiness Licensing portal to help more businesses meet their different needs as they start up, as they grow and as they run. We will streamline our digital transactions, make them even more user-centric, and provide businesses with information and tools so that they can capitalise on opportunities and to reducecost. MTI will elaborate on this during itsCOS.We will also be exploring more National Digital Identity use cases for businesses in order to make it cheaper, easier and faster for them to go digital. We are testing the use of SingPass by businesses so they do not have to build and secure their own digital identity verification systems. Union members can currently access the U Portal via SingPass and Republic Plaza grants building access when visitors enter via SingPass Mobile. No more surrendering your NRIC.We also ran a 12-month pilot last year for MyInfo Business to help SMEs pre-fill their Government-verified data for bank account opening and loan applications. Later this year, we will extend such pre-filling to more business-to-business (B2B) services.Of course, a Smart Nation must go beyond just fancy online services and apps. It must improve the daily lived experience, as emphasised by Dr Teo Ho Pin.Punggol Town will be our test bed to implement smart technologies such as the Open Digital Platform and smart energy grids in our towns. Later this year, we will share more about how smart features in residential estates and community facilities will benefit Punggol residents and ultimately – I must emphasise – all other towns.Mr Pritam Singh has asked about the trials of Lamppost as a Platform in One North and Geylang, and I thank him for asking that.Let me just take a step back and explain why lampposts. Lampposts are ubiquitous. There are 100,000 of them in Singapore. They have the advantage of being in a have fixed location. Lampposts do not move. They are always powered. These attributes have made them very convenient to deploy sensors on. We are deploying sensors and testing out some use cases. For instance, to keep track of environmental quality sensing, traffic congestion and crowd safety.Let me assure Mr Pritam Singh – I listened carefully to his speech. I think that the key point that he made is balance: that we must get the balance right between acquiring data, using it and protecting privacy and security. If we get the balance right – and we have to maintain public confidence – then we can truly reap the benefits that come with it.So, I need to assure you that we have very stringent data management and protection standards to govern the access, the use and the disclosure of all collected data by the Government and our vendors. In particular, only officers with legitimate use of the data will be able to access the data, and the data will be de-identified for data analysis and for planning work. It will be identifiable only when absolutely necessary. For instance, in service delivery or in the case of facial recognition, if the Police need it to identify missing persons or for the purposes of investigation, then, under carefully controlled circumstances, that will be enabled. I would like to remind the House that public officers are subjected to the Public Service (Governance) Act, which makes mis-handling and unauthorised access of data a criminal offence.Going forward, we will find more opportunities to deploy sensors on lamp posts, but we will ensure that the collected data is stored and used securely, and Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary will elaborate on this later.Let me conclude. Smart Nation has benefited citizens and businesses. There is increased of capacity to deal with rapidly changing circumstances and emergencies in the real world. We will continue to evolve how the Government operates innovatively in a digital environment and we will work even more closely in partnership with our people.The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary): Mr Chairman, to support our fight against COVID-19, many GovTech engineers worked with the rest of the Public Service to build new digital services. One team put together MaskGoWhere almost overnight, giving citizens up-to-date information on where to collect their masks. This was identified as an urgent need to allay fears, provide accurate, reliable and real-time information. It needed to be created very quickly. Other teams worked on providing accurate information through the Gov.sg WhatsApp channel, Ask Jamie chatbot and developing software to help MOM monitor Leave of Absence compliance – just to name a few of these digital efforts to support our fight against COVID-19.I recently met Mr Ryan Tan, who was part of the team that put together MaskGoWhere. He has been with GovTech for five years, having joined us through the Technology Associate Programme immediately upon his graduation from NUS. He volunteered to help put MaskGoWhere together. He was part of an initial team. The team started with three people, scaled up to 30 people over a weekend and then, back down to three or four when it became stable. He applied his skills in cloud architecture and app development and deployment. He also applied the analytics tools that he works on in his normal job, embedding them within MaskGoWhere, so that the team was able to optimise their service's response in real time, as it received almost a million unique views over a very short time.This story of Ryan and other members of the MaskGoWhere team is an example of how we are transforming digital Government. Their willingness to step forward and rapidly put together what they understood was a solution to an urgent problem and the fact that they had the tools and capabilities to do so immediately demonstrates that we are well on the way to becoming a Government that is \"digital to the core\" and \"serving with a heart\".These outcomes are only possible because we decided to build up the digital engineering capability of the Government into a strategic capability a few years ago. With this strong engineering core, we can internalise within our service the capabilities and the skills, to use technology to transform our core businesses as well as develop the confidence to integrate with external stakeholders and the private sector, building platforms such as MyInfo – not just for ourselves but to enable our whole economy to innovate and digitalise. Finally, as in this example with COVID-19, we can respond swiftly and decisively to unexpected national contingencies.So, to Mr Vikram Nair's question, we will continue to invest in engineering capabilities, create the right environment and exciting opportunities for engineers to apply their ingenuity to serve the public good.More than developing good people, we have had to re-engineer how we use technology. To enable better and secure use of data, we have established the Government Data Architecture. It has been delivered, cutting the time needed to share the first tranche of core data sets to just four weeks when previously, it was several months. It will shorten further. We commit to getting it down to seven working days within this year, with more data sets for public officers to improve operations and service delivery.As Prof Lim Sun Sun has mentioned, more data will also be shared with companies and researchers in the future. The progress that we have made in allowing this type of data sharing and the use of cloud-based services were also key factors that has enabled the MaskGoWhere team to deliver their swift and effective response.I agree with the suggestions made by Mr Darryl David and Dr Yaacob Ibrahim on the importance of maintaining public trust in our use of data and I would like to assure Members that the implementation of the Public Sector Data Security Review Committee (PSDSRC) is on track. Many of these technical safeguards have been built into our Government Data Architecture, ensuring that there is consistency in the compliance of these standards. We will publish an annual update on the Government's efforts in safeguarding personal data, starting with the first report later this year.We have also migrated non-sensitive IT systems to the cloud to take advantage of the latest technology and to improvecost-effectiveness. Similarly, we are adopting the best practices in software development by building a technology stack with modular software components for reuse and sharing across agencies.Putting all these together, we can more effectively harness digitalisation to serve our citizens and businesses better.Despite COVID-19, work continues on many platforms, products and services. Moments of Life is one example and GoBusiness is another, which embodies how we use digital technology to integrate services across agencies to be more user-centric. PSD will give further elaboration on this.But we must also create new value for citizens to be \"digital to the core\". One example is WSG's MyCareersFuture. This portal uses machine learning, matching job seekers to relevant opportunities. Its job recommendations are personalised to the preferences and skills of each jobseeker, and it will get better and improve its performance over time.We hope that with this approach, we can also design better policies. This has started and a team from MOM has used a cross-agency administrative data set to review how Workfare can strengthen retirement adequacy of lower income workers. Their analysis informed the Workfare enhancements that were announced in the last Budget and implemented since the start of this year.To best serve the needs of our society and citizens, we need to actively partner Singaporeans in building our Smart Nation, a point made by Ms Tin Pei Ling. Ours is a digital version of SG Together comprising two broad strategies. Firstly, we will develop more avenues for citizens to experience technology first-hand, learning more about how all these work. Secondly, we have to create opportunities for Singaporeans to join us in designing better products, services and platforms.To support the first experiential strategy, we are launching two major Smart Nation showcases – in July, the CityScape@URA exhibit, to give citizens an interactive experience of digital technology, and in December,\tthe PlayScape@Science Centre, leveraging on the role that the Science Centre plays in our education, to bring the experience of being able to touch and feel and play with technology, to everyone.We hope to demystify technology and to encourage as many citizens as possible to visit these exhibits.For the second collaborative design strategy, we have previously launched with an initiative called Smart Nation Co-creating with Our People Everywhere, also known as SCOPE, where citizens try out early prototypes of our products and share their thoughts on how they can be refined.This has been very useful. It has allowed us to continually test our ideas and improve them over time. One example, when we were developing the Active Ageing features for Moments of Life, many seniors suggested that the app should help them find exercise events nearby. This was not something that we had prioritised, but we adjusted our plans and now this is one of the most popular features of that service.To date, more than 23,000 Singaporeans have participated in SCOPE and it is not a small effort. I would like to thank our community of more than 1,000 Smart Nation Ambassadors, bringing these Smart Nation projects to Singaporeans from all walks of life.This year, we will expand the scope of SCOPE in two ways. First, we will start further upstream. Instead of just giving feedback on specific projects, we invite the public to join in the entire process of the development of Government digital services – from conceptualisation to deployment. Second, we will bring SCOPE closer to residents by holding the sessions on board a Smart Nation Builder mobile truck, which will slowly make its way around Singapore. Please look out for it when it comes to your neighbourhood. We will continue to make sure that we build digital readiness in Singaporeans so that they can take advantage of these opportunities and MCI will share more on this.Mr Chairman, Sir, our swift response to the COVID-19 situation is a glimpse of how Smart Nation is already here to impact our daily lives. We must continue to transform how Government works, by re-engineering our digital resources, investing in our people, and co-creating with the public. In doing so, we hope to galvanise everyone to build our Smart Nation together.3.30 pmSafe Banking for Elderly and AllMr Png Eng Huat (Hougang): Sir, the number of scams in all involving e-commerce, loan, credit for sex and impersonation rose by 53.5% last year. There were about 9,500 scams reported in 2019 up from 6,000 over cases in the previous years. The total amount cheated in the top 10 types of scams came up to a staggering $168 million. Scamming is not only lucrative, it is also getting more sophisticated.Some scams do not put it on the nature of greed. They are disguised as service calls from telcos, banks or Government authorities. These scams capitalise on the victims' lack of knowledge on how things function in the Internet age. An innocuous core is all it takes for the scammer to try to gain remote access to the victim's computer, bank account information, personal identification number and one-time password. The end results are often heart wrenching. Victims of tech support scheme lost $13.9 million of their hard-earned savings in 2019.Just last November, a 65-year-old woman picked up a call on her landline thinking it was a customer service call from a telco. She spent over two hours on the line with the scammer and by the end of the call, over $300,000 of her savings were wiped out from her bank account. It is very painful and sad to read in the news about elderly Singaporeans being scammed in this manner time and again, despite all the effort by the Police to educate the public about such crime.In the pursuit of a cashless society and a Smart Nation, have we made life a breeze for one generation and more vulnerable for another? I am for progress but I am deeply concerned that some Singaporeans would be exposed to untold dangers in the digital jungle.Most of the scams leverage on one thing in common, to make a clean getaway. The speed of online banking transaction, by the time a Police report is made, the victims' money would have disappeared into thin air. Even if anyone caught here or overseas, there is very little hope for the victim to see his life savings again.Would it not be possible for the Ministry to mandate the banks to offer more protection for the elderly and vulnerable from falling victims to such scams? Would it not make sense for the gatekeeper of the conduit for interbank transfer to play a bigger role to combat such crime?Let me relate another case. One of my resident was tricked into giving out his one-time passcode in a similar tech support scam, he ended up losing his life savings in two local banks. The scammer did his homework and contacted the resident late on a Friday night. By the time this resident realised that something was not right, the bank had closed and he could only call the after-office helpline for assistance.The perplexing part of this case is that, only one bank would stop the illegal transfer while the other could not and both financial institutions are using the same international remittance network.Another one of my resident was so spooked by such scam that he asked the bank to issue him an ordinary bank card with no wireless payment feature or linked to any international debit or credit service provider. He was told there is no such card anymore, but he could request the bank to limited the transaction amount or disable the debit feature. If such feature can be disabled with a phone call, what safeguards are there to prevent scammers from reversing it?This is exactly what the elderly resident was worried about. He just wanted a simple bank card for cash withdrawal. This educated resident told me he need to be careful because he knows his reflexes, cognition, memory and everything else he took for granted in the past are ageing too.Sir, could we not ask the bank to institute additional safeguards that are designed specifically for this group of users so that they will not fall victim to scammers and their hard-earned monies will not be stolen so easily in the blink of an eye?While the scammer may work on this victim for hours, the success of such scams hinges on the split-second transfer of money out of the victim's bank account. If we have cooling-off period for direct sale, can the bank offers such feature for interbank transfer on demand as well? Any change of mind for such a cooling-off service will require a visit to the bank in person. Although this sounds like a low-tech approach, you can certainly buy some time and time is what scammers do not want.I am not asking the authority to slow everything down. I am only asking the authority to get the banks to provide an option for the elderly and vulnerable to protect their life savings. The Police can only do so much to investigate after the crime has been committed. It does not have the weapon of choice to stop or slow down the scammer from laying hands on the ill-gotten gains.Sir, such scams are not going away when there is easy money to be made. It was reported in the news yesterday that the number of banking scam calls or messages went up sharply in January this year with 105 cases reported, compared to 38 cases in the previous three months combined. To me, that is a red flag for the authority to take the lead to fight scammers that capitalise on the banking system to steal from the elderly and vulnerable.The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung): Online scams and crimes are indeed on the rise, Sir. I agree with the Member that each case is very painful, very sad. Every one of us can be targeted and the elderly are especially vulnerable. Such scams and crimes typically trick individuals into handing over monies through fake investment schemes or by using their personal information to access their bank accounts. The few cases that Mr Png mentioned fall into the latter category. The criminals can reach out to their victims either through phone calls, messages, emails, even cyber attacks.The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Singapore Police Force (SPF), the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and our banks, have been working together to protect Singaporeans against these online scams and crimes. Our efforts have focused on the following four areas.First, raising public awareness. Public agencies have stepped up educational initiatives through media campaigns, roadshows and community outreach programmes. MoneySense, our national financial education programme, regularly puts out public messages to caution the public against online crimes and scams. Banks also regularly remind their customers, \"Do not to disclose your account details, User IDs, passwords or SMS One-Time-Passwords (OTPs) to anyone, no matter who they claim to be\". Bank customers have also been encouraged to maintain strong cyber hygiene by installing anti-virus software and regularly updating it.Second, MAS has issued various regulations and guidelines related to the security of online transactions. For example, banks must implement multi-factor authentication so that scammers cannot perform online transactions using only the User IDs and passwords of their victims. You must have the OTPs as well. Fraud monitoring and detection systems are another prerequisite to facilitate timely detection and blocking of suspicious transactions. On a real-time basis, transaction alerts are sent to customers to allow them to quickly notify their banks of any unauthorised payment transactions. These security measures to curb unauthorised transactions, have become industry norms in Singapore.Third, we freeze accounts suspected of receiving the proceeds from online scams. Where specific bank accounts have been identified to be associated with scams, the SPF's Anti-Scam Centre will freeze the relevant bank accounts as soon as possible. Doing so disrupts the scam operation and increases the chances of recovering victims' monies. In this regard, Mr Png suggested a possible cooling-off option and feature for elderly customers to opt-in, so that when they make a transfer, maybe it will happen 24 hours later. This is something that we can discuss with the banks as a possible way to help, as an option for elderly customers.Fourth, where the scam is cross-border in nature, SPF will seek the cooperation of their foreign counterparts. The Transnational Commercial Crime Task Force (TCTF) was set up in October 2017 to investigate transnational scams such as China Officials Impersonation Scams, Internet Love Scams and Credit-for-Sex scams. It actively shares information with foreign law enforcement agencies and where possible, works with them to mount joint operations. Nine operations have been conducted since the set-up of TCTF, which resulted in at least 440 cases solved and the arrest of over 100 suspects regionally.But, as Mr Png mentioned, the sophistication of scams will continue to evolve. The criminals are getting smarter and smarter. The cross-border nature also poses additional challenges and limits what our public agencies and banks can achieve on their own. That is why core to our anti-cyber scam strategy has to be public awareness and education, so that all of us remain vigilant and do not fall prey to cybercrimes.During this COVID-19, we are all constantly reminded to first, wash our hands frequently; second, do not touch our faces unnecessarily and third, when we are unwell, go see a doctor and do not go to school or do not go to work. These are the three key pieces of advice that we should heed.Likewise, the three key pieces of advice to fight cyber scams are: one, never draw money from our account to pass to anyone, even if they claim to be from the authorities; two, never share your personal and banking details, especially your One-Time-Password (OTP) with anyone; and if in doubt, three, consult your loved ones, call the anti-scam helpline or visit NCPC's Scam Alert website at scamalert.sg.As the Police advise – \"Don't Panic, Don't Believe, Don't Give\", \"别慌。别信。别给。\" MHA will elaborate about its strategies to address scams at itsCOS.SkillsFuture for the Public ServiceMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast): Just as SkillsFuture is crucial for the private sector, it is also vital for the public sector to embrace SkillsFuture. This is especially so today, with technology and digitalisation disrupting work, workers and workplaces regardless of where you are in the world and what you do.Today, we have seen several traditional jobs being automated completely, for example, services that are now online and where customers can do self-checkout and self-help. On the other hand, we also see some jobs, that are performed very differently today – for instance, through deploying RPA and \"training\" robots, as opposed to performing the manual tasks ourselves. What this means for Singapore, is that as a small and open economy, we need to be able to transform and innovate new products and services to maintain our competitiveness, while working within manpower constraints. Technology and longer career spans are two positive opportunities that can help us overcome our constraints. This underscores the importance of Industry 4.0 and SkillsFuture to ensure that the public sector stays ready, relevant and resilient.To achieve a win-win-win outcome for workers, employers and the economy, we must continually upskill our workers to equip them with in-demand skills of today and of the future. This will help them take on quality jobs and better jobs should their jobs become automated or replaced by machines.The public sector has taken the lead in extending the retirement and re-employment age a year ahead of schedule. It has also been working with NTUC-affiliated unions to form Company Training Committees in its push to promote skills upgrading.In this vein, how does the public sector intend to help its officers achieve lifelong employability, given that the skill requirements and jobs would evolve throughout a longer career span? How has it been engaging the Labour Movement to help officers understand, embrace and thrive in a new environment that is increasingly dynamic and even disruptive? What has been the progress in terms of skills upgrading within the Public Service?SkillsFuture for Public OfficersDr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang): Sir, at the lastCOS, I sought an update on the skills development of public officers. As the problems of today are becoming more complex, nuanced and require different solutions from the problems of the past, it is inevitable that our public officers will be required to learn new skills and sharpen existing skills.This is a real concern in light of the findings by the Auditor-General’s Office of recurring lapses in the bureaucracy which have raised concerns on public accountability, especially in the areas of procurement and contract management, project management and facilities management.There are several reasons why these lapses have occurred: first, outsourcing of work, with price as the greatest determining factor of selecting contracts. Second, lack of expertise, especially among mid to high level bureaucrats. Third, high frequency of staff rotation and poor protocols in relation to the handing over of duties. Fourth, insufficient use of technology to reduce human error. Fifth, a lack of accreditation or standards for public officers.Sir, as Singapore becomes a worldclass city with worldclass infrastructure, our public officers must have the skill sets to manage increasingly complex projects. Our public officers also need to possess the relevant expertise in order to carry out their responsibilities and plan, staff and supervise projects closely.This is so that we can ensure that our public officers can work closely with stakeholders in the various industries, to ensure quality delivery of public services, public projects and smooth completion of private sector projects.3.45 pmIt is, therefore, imperative that our Public Service pushes itself to continually improve and keep up with the times.Sir, I wish to seek an update from the Minister on the skills upgrading and development of public officers as well as aspiring public officers, especially in the three areas which I have mentioned. Can the Government also consider giving out scholarships to nurture and attract talent in these fields?Role of PMOMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member): Mr Chairman, Sir, when I first entered this House in 2016, the Estimated Budget for the PMO was $488 million. In the latest Estimates, this has risen to $1.05 billion. The PMO houses functions that cut across Ministries relating to climate and population, for example. But over the years, the PMO has also come to acquire coordinating and leadership roles in a number of areas where there would seem to be a more natural fit with domain Ministries. For example, why is National Research Foundation programme under the PMO rather than MTI since research should be pursued in such a way as to maximise and multiply its benefits to industry and to the economy, which is MTI's purview?A similar point could be made for the National Security and Intelligence Coordination programme vis-a-vis MINDEF which would seem the natural location for the ownership of Total Defence programmes; SNDGO vis-a-vis the Ministry of Communications and Information.In the debate on the GovTech Bill in 2016, I asked why the CSA was at that time located in the PMO rather than within MINDEF, the answer was, \"this is to give the CSA the ability to oversee cybersecurity at the national level, and so on\". Does this mean that all policymaking fields that function at the national as opposed to sectoral level and cut across Ministries to some degree will eventually come under the PMO? And if so, how do we ensure that the duplication of functions and expertise is minimised vis-a-vis domain Ministries, which generally have more staff with expertise in the domains? How would we also ensure that due weight in policymaking is given to subject matter experts in the domain Ministries?Innovative Public ServiceMr Lee Yi Shyan (East Coast): Sir, our Public Service has long been recognised for its efficiency and transparency and as a key factor underpinning Singapore’s success. Worldwide, technology is disrupting business models, reshaping supply chains and creating new jobs. In this creative disruption process, those who cannot keep up will be left behind.Going forward, Singapore's future depends on the support of a forward-looking and technology-savvy Public Service – one which is wary of the speed and scale of competition, hungry for new ideas, has the capacity to learn and undertakes its tasks with a sense of urgency.Given this context, I would like to ask the Minister, over the years, how has our Public Service re-invented itself to keep up with competition? How has the Public Service embraced technology to render itself more efficient and to serve its clients more effectively? What has the Public Service done to encourage, induce and catalyse large-scale innovations among businesses and society at large?According to a Zaobao report, Mr Lan Shaomin, the current Party Secretary of Suzhou, when he was the Mayor of Taizhou in 2016, gave out \"Snail Awards\" (蜗牛奖) to 57 individuals and organisations for their \"slow work\" or \"non work\". Such is a city in a hurry. Does the Public Service, perhaps, in a different but no less urgent way, reward its internal innovators and change agents and punish the procrastinators and non-performers?Care and Empathy in Public Sector DeliveryMr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer): Mr Chairman, my cut today is to discuss how our Public Service can show greater care and empathy in designing and delivering services to citizens.In the past few years, the Public Service has embarked on digitalisation to transform the way it delivers services. This was elaborated by Minister Vivian and Dr Janil. This is, of course, to be encouraged.However, there is still a group of citizens who may be unable to transact digitally, such as some elderly who may be unfamiliar with computers and smart phones or others from low-income families who cannot afford such smart phones or broadband access.It is great that the Government seeks higher effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery. But the more \"digital\" Singapore's public sector becomes, the more challenging it is for those who are ill-equipped.I am proposing that we try out a programme called \"digital buddy\". Such a programme would have digital buddies, who are volunteers, to partner those who are not digitally savvy to assist them in navigating Government digital services. They could be relatives, college students, grassroots members, corporate employees on CSR or just helpful neighbours.Beyond guiding those who are not digitally savvy in society to cope with our nation’s digitalisation journey, such buddy interactions would also promote community bonding and forge a more cohesive society – one where no one is left behind.As for hardware, smartphones or laptops and broadband access at home may be taken for granted by many but, to a lower income family, this could be a burden. And I would urge the Government to aim for a position whereby those who want it but cannot afford it can have it through subsidies.I am also particularly concerned with school children from lower income families who may not be able to afford a computer or broadband access at home. In today’s learning environment, a computer and broadband access are like \"paper and pen\" of the past and, therefore, no child should be denied that.I would like to ask the Minister how the Public Service can improve on the way it serves and supports citizens, especially those who are vulnerable and not digitally savvy.Transforming Service DeliveryMr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah): Businesses around the world have increasingly been using digital technologies to upscale their operations, seek better efficiencies and create value for their entities.There are now countless mobile phone apps and online platforms where businesses can use to acquire, engage and transact with their customers. This has brought about better conveniences, accessibility, outreach and also, importantly, lower transaction fees to their customers due to efficiency gains. Thecost savings from better efficiency and outreach benefited both the businesses and customers.Can I ask if the Public Service would do likewise to tap on digital technology in a bigger way to transform service delivery to citizens and businesses?The Public Service is not starting from ground zero. It has launched the Moments of Life app for birth registration a couple of years ago and it has just been announced that there will be an enhanced version.Such service apps can help eliminate the unnecessary inconveniences where businesses or citizens need to go to more than one agency to get things done. If properly designed, it can also avoid duplication in resources or situations where different sets of officers are serving the same customer in different agencies.The Public Service should look towards integrating its services and, where possible, establish a one-stop user-friendly digital platform, which can also reduce the need for manual delivery of services. I would like to seek an update from PMO on the progress in this area.The Chairman: Minister Chan.The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing): Mr Chairman, Sir, I will deliver my reply in half the time that I was supposed to.Mr Chairman, Sir, a strong, competent and forward-looking Public Service has been central to Singapore's success. It has been so and it will continue to be so. Let me first deal with Mr Leon Perera's question on how PMO decides which programmes come under its purview. There are usually three sets of considerations. First, if it deals with strategic issues with long-term consequences. Second, if it requires close coordination across many agencies. Third, if it is a nascent new capability where we need to incubate that capability development before we pass it on to a relevant Ministry.So, you are right. Over time, those agencies that fall under PMO would have satisfied one or more of these criteria. When the capabilities mature, they will be passed on to the relevant Ministries that best house them.Let me now deal with the rest of the questions from the other Members. I would just like to organise them into two sets of answers. First, what can the public expect from our Public Service? Second, what can the Public Service officers expect, going forward? Let me deal with the first.The first and most fundamental mindset shift required before we even talk about all these technologies is this. The Public Service is committed to design our services and processes around the people whom we serve, around the businesses whom we serve. Now, this is fundamental. The rest will follow from here.So, as mentioned, digital is a tremendous opportunity for the Public Service to embrace to better deliver our services in a more integrated fashion, at a faster speed at a lowercost. And we have heard many examples of this with The Moments of Life app and also the GoBusiness app and I will not repeat what Minister Vivian and Senior Minister of State Janil have mentioned.The second thing that we can expect with this mindset shift would be the cross-training of our officers to deliver services in an integrated manner. Our Tampines Hub is a great example. Various public agencies have come together to first co-locate and provide convenience to residents seeking services across different agencies. Today, we have moved on whereby a single officer has been cross-trained to provide services across different agencies.This is the direction that the Public Service will continue to go in order to deliver quality services to the residents who need help. So, someone who needs help, from financial assistance to housing to employment, can approach the same officer with the same understanding so that he does not need to repeat the story over and over again. So, this is the second example of how the mindset shift has gone on in the Public Service.The third shift that we can expect from the Public Service is this. The Public Service is no longer just an agency trying to prevent things from going wrong or bad things from happening.When the Public Service partners our businesses, we are in real partnership with them to catalyse new ideas to enhance their competitiveness for Singapore. Now, this is a very different mindset shift.When we work with a start-up, it is not about the start-up trying to fit into the current regulations. The regulators also need to change their mindset whereby they embrace the start-up culture to see how regulations can evolve to become a key competitive advantage for Singapore. So, the public can certainly expect a more integrated and more efficient Public Service.But what I want to end off on this part is what Mr Cedric Foo mentioned. No matter how technology-dependent we will be, we will never forget that at the core of the Public Service is the heart for our people. The way we design the services, the way we design the app, be it for the young or the old, is to make sure that the service is delivered with the heart. For people who need the service but are unable to access technology, we will make sure that the processes are simplified, the service delivery is integrated, so that they will never be left out. And that is how we want to design an inclusive Public Service.The second part of my speech will, therefore, touch on what the Public Service officers can expect. With the changes in public expectations, with the change in job scopes, we will certainly need to change the skill sets of our Public Service officers. I have mentioned this on various occasions and the Prime Minister has also mentioned this during the inaugural Annual Public Service Leadership Dinner in the earlier part of this year.Today, we expect Public Service officers not just to be savvy in policymaking, but we also expect them to be good in translating policies into operations, have the ability to communicate and mobilise the public to come and work together to deliver results. And we want our public officers to have a sense of what is going on beyond Singapore, beyond the Public Service. These are the new skillsets that we expect all Public Service leaders to have and this will be how we form leadership teams within the Public Service.One of the things that we will also change is to more regularly rotate Public Service officers across different domains and even within the same domain. Across different domains, I have mentioned, in that four domain areas – policymaking, operations, communications and mobilisations and international or beyond Public Service exposure.4.00 pmThe second thing that we want to is to make sure that they have the ability to rotate more even within the same domain and this will address one of the points that Dr Teo Ho Pin mentioned. How do we make sure that we check our own blind spots even if we are doing the same job? For example, in regulatory matters, by being able to go to different agencies and see how different regulatory ideas are applied, will allow our public officers to be much more responsive, much more agile.The third thing that we can expect our public officers to do is this. If we have a 50-year career for the Public Service officer, we must make sure that they have the training that can allow them to have lifelong employability, as Mr Patrick has also mentioned. And this will require us to structure their training such that every few years, there will be a booster jab in their skills. When we ask our Public Service officers to be agile, it cannot be at the age of 40s or 50s. It must be done systematically, from age 20 and above.Next, we will also challenge our Public Service officers, especially those in leadership positions to go beyond the Public Service, that they will have regular stints beyond the Public Service to expose themselves to the challenges that the private sector and the people sector have. But at the same time, to also bring back good ideas that the public sector may not yet have that are now in the private sector of the people sector or, for that matter, also even in the international organisations.The Public Service Division will make sure that we organise ourselves to systematically rotate our officers within the Service, across domains and beyond the Service.Next, we will also make sure that there is greater porosity in the Public Service, from the way we recruit people, beyond just academic qualifications, to the way we develop people and post people throughout the entire lifespan that they are here.Having dealt with all the changes that we can expect from the Public Service, I must reiterate one point. While the methods can change, the technology can change, the values of the Public Service will not change. The values of service excellence and integrity will never change in the Public Service. Service beyond self. The interests of the country and our people must always come before the interests of the individual officers. The pursuit of excellence is not just for today but always being able to anticipate the challenges of tomorrow, put in place systems and processes before the challenges even arise.And finally, integrity. Integrity to do what is right for this generation and for the next. Just as Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat says, our definition of success is not just how well we deliver for this generation but also for the next. Integrity also to know that there is no such thing that we are at our best. That is only that we will continue to improve to bring about better of life for Singaporeans and for a better Singapore. So, we will keep engaging the ground, keep improving our processes, keep improving the skillsets of our Public Service officers, in order for us to deliver on a better Singapore, a stronger Singapore and a better future for all of us.The Chairman: Any clarifications? Mr Louis Ng.Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: Thank you, Sir. I just wanted to ask Minister Josephine Teo about the childcare sick leave. I understand that we are reviewing it but I am just wondering we can also review and look into what other countries are doing. There is a long list of countries that are providing the childcare sick leave – I would not read the whole thing – there is Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland. It is a much longer list. In the interest, I would not read them all. But I am just wondering whether PMO can study what other countries are doing, see how successful it is, see how they implement it and then we can do a proper review. I think the Minister once said that all good things will be considered. This is a good thing that should be considered.Mrs Josephine Teo: Mr Chairman, the short answer to Mr Ng is yes. We do actually study and we study them holistically too. The Marriage and Parenthood Support measures, they do work in concert with one another and they have to work within the context of each country. And I think in our case, what is even more relevant is to reach out to the young people themselves and ask them what is it that they are looking for. And they have been consistent in telling us: help us with housing, help us with pre-school, help us with healthcare, and very importantly, help us to achieve more flexible work arrangements.So, we will look at all good suggestions in the context of what our young people want.The Chairman: Mr Leon Perera.Mr Leon Perera: Thank you, Sir. Just a small clarification to Minister Chan. If I understood Minister Chan correctly, he said that there are three considerations for determining the functions within the PMO. And I think the third point was that, functions are sometimes incubated and then transferred to a Ministry where there is a more natural fit with the domain of that Ministry after a certain period of time.So, firstly, is that understanding correct? And secondly, where does that leave us, in terms of functions that have been there for a very long time? For example, the NRF. It is under PMO. I think that has been there for quite sometime vis-a-vis MTI.Mr Chan Chun Sing: I thank Mr Leon Perera for that. On NRF, I would just like to clarify that NRF does not just serve economic functions. The NRF also conducts research in many other things, for example, ageing and societal forces as well. So, there is a good reason why NRF resides under PMO.Having said that, the NRF works very closely with MTI and, of course, A*STAR which is under MTI for the economic portions of it. So, whether it is the future of decarbonisation, the future of our bio-medical industries, they work very closely. We have also a very simple way to make sure that this is coordinated closely between NRF, A*STAR and MTI because the Chairperson of A*STAR is also the Permanent Secretary for NRF. If the two organisations have any issues, then it is actually internalised within the leadership team.The Chairman: Mr Pritam Singh.Mr Pritam Singh: Thank you, Chairman. I have two questions and one clarification. The two questions are for Minister Josephine Teo. I thank the Minister for her speech at the PMOCOScovering population issues. Two points I raised in my cut. The first was the number of PRs that do not transition to citizenship. I think there was some very helpful data that was released in the Population in Brief document from September last year, that tells you at what age group these PRs are at. But what about those that do not transit to citizenship? What are those numbers like?The second clarification pertains to the question I had on integration. I think the Minister also re-stated the point that new immigrants have to play their part and get involved. But on the flip side, we have two or three decades now of immigration experience. What are some of the points that the immigrants themselves raised? What are the issues that they had in integrating with the community?The third point is a clarification for Minister Vivian. I think Minister Vivian said that Senior Minister of State Janil was going to say something about smart lamp posts but I do not believe the Senior Minister of State said anything about that. So, I am just clarifying that point.The Chairman: I think they were running out of time. Minister Josephine.Mrs Josephine Teo: Mr Chairman, with regard to PRs, I think the important thing is that the PR population has been quite stable. It has been about half a million; we have basically kept it at that level. There will always be a certain number that may take awhile before they decide to become citizens. If they leave Singapore and do not return for a long period of time, then their re-entry permits could be cancelled.As they become citizens, the length of time they take to become citizens does not matter. Some take a shorter time; some take a longer time. Sometimes, it is a matter of thinking about it themselves, because it is hard to eventually make that transition. In some cases, they move faster. I think the important thing is that we have kept the PR population stable.Then, to the Member's other question. I think this is with regard to integration as to what do the new citizens themselves say about the challenges of integration. The practical thing will be that social habits are different. Singapore has high density living, and most will live in public housing, very close to their neighbours. That is why a lot of the emphasis on integration is carried out through the People's Association, which has the ability to reach to a large number of citizens. This includes new as well as long-time citizens.The other is a very interesting observation is almost certainly, that second generation citizens acquire the features of local life very quickly. And it is through the second generation that they themselves become naturalised. I think this is not unique to Singapore. It is true of many different countries.The Chairman: Minister VivianDr Vivian Balakrishnan: I hope collectively, we have addressed the Member's concern about data security and privacy, and the need to get that balance right in order to maintain public confidence. Senior Minister State Janil may not have mentioned lamp posts specifically, but he did talk about security. And I think this House is also aware of the overarching policy and legislative framework for data security, both within Government and in the private sector.The Chairman: Mr Cedric Foo.Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng: Chairman, this question is for Minister Chan. Historically, many Government agencies and Ministries design systems and processes from their points of view. I think the public will be well served if Government agencies can think \"the other way around\" and try to design processes from the citizens' or businesses' points of view. Does PMO intend to achieve this?Mr Chan Chun Sing: Mr. Chairman, indeed, we totally agree with what Mr Cedric had said. And that is my point. We need to turn this around. It is easy, it is usual for people to think from their own perspective – how do people fit into my Ministry's policy objectives? So, from the exercise in designing the Moments of Life and equivalent apps, we have turned this around. We have asked people, \"If you are a parent-to-be, what are the questions that you would want answered? What are the services that you would want?\"We do what we call a Service Journey. The officers, together from different Ministries and agencies, will walk the entire journey and imagine themselves in the shoes of the people that they are going to serve. And from there on, all their services will be designed around making it more convenient for the people that they are serving. That is how we have been able to achieve breakthroughs in the Moments of Life and even our Tampines Hub (OTH).But there is another very important element that we are putting our officers through. It is what we call empathy training or empathy design. How we lay out the services to welcome the residents whom we serve, how we design the processes that they have to go through. That requires training. It is not an after-thought. How our officers speak to the residents is also an acquired skill.In order to do that, we make sure that our Public Service leaders walk-the-talk. We make sure people, right from the leadership level, take the lead, by going onto the ground to serve the residents. So, we have many examples of this whereby even Chief Executives and the leadership team will be at the service counter serving the residents, seeing how the residents respond to the policies from different agencies, what are the challenges and how we can redesign the processes to do better.We have senior officers, for example, in the communications department and various other public officers walking the ground on weekends, talking to ordinary Singaporeans, hearing their feedback first-hand, unfiltered. This is part of the work that the REACH officers are doing. But it is not just the REACH officers that are doing this. Actually, many of our officers whom I am very proud of volunteered to do this so that they can go to the ground and hear for themselves first-hand how people are responding and reacting to the changes that they make.So, it is design upfront, change in their mindset and training of the officers in order to deliver a much more empathetic Public Service. Sorry, Mr Chair, can I just give an example to the Mr Leon Perera? I talked about incubation and then, subsequently, we transfer it. MSO is one good example. MSO started in PMO; now, it has gone on MND when the capabilities have been matured.The Chairman: Mr Seah, would you like to withdraw your amendment?Mr Seah Kian Peng: Mr Chairman, on behalf of all Members who spoke, I wish to thank Senior Minister Teo, Ministers Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Mrs Josephine Teo, Mr Ong Ye Kung and Mr Chan Chun Sing, and Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary, for their comprehensive and assuring responses on matters ranging from climate change, population challenges, Smart Nation initiatives and Public Service.I would like to take this opportunity too to thank all the men and women, not just in the Prime Minister's Office, but the entire civil service for their good work, their hard work and their consistent work, day in, day out, 366 days in a year – this, being a Leap Year. With that, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $823,582,100 for Head U ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $226,169,400 for Head U ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.Mr Speaker: Order.

        "Content": "5.45 pmGrowing Our EconomyMr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah): Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\"As a small and open economy, Singapore can only be a price-taker in the global marketplace realistically. Staying competitive is a given but that just puts you in the starting line. We need to develop both value-adding capabilities, which I will touch on later, and, equally important, our market connectivity capabilities, so that we can sell our products and services to the consumers of the world. Having both sets of capabilities and the intensity of them will determine how much of a livelihood we can make for ourselves.In Singapore's context, staying open and connected to the world is key and our only pathway to continued economic growth and progress. Today, our international linkages and market connectivity enable us to transcend our limited domestic market and create for ourselves a bigger hinterland to operate in. We need to continually expand and upgrade our network of trade partnerships and investment agreements so that our companies can not only have a bigger economic space to do business in but are also able to ride on the growth and opportunities in the emerging markets.Over the decades, we have done very well to strengthen our air, sea and land connectivity. In the new landscape, we need develop other new sets of connectivities, such as regulations, data, talent, finance and technology.These efforts are primarily Government-driven but, importantly, we also need businesses to step up to seize these opportunities from the enhanced connectivity. It requires the companies to build up the required capabilities to internationalise both at the enterprise and the workforce levels. Capabilities, such as deep understanding of the target markets, ability to mobilise and deploy resources and talents across markets and jurisdictions, ability to obtain local funding and manage currency risks, among others.Our economic agencies already provide both financial and non-financial support to help companies internationalise, such as in in-market landing pads, overseas centres and so on. Here, I would like to ask the Minister if the support has been adequate and has there been good traction.Beyond the more familiar markets like China, India and the developed economies, do our economic agencies need to step up expertise and presence in newer and more frontier markets as we know that these markets tend to have less developed market data and more challenging regulatory and operating environment? How can the Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) play an enabling role to help businesses seeking to internationalise, especially in less familiar markets?On diversification of international markets, the COVID-19 outbreak reminded us on the urgency to seek more and newer markets, especially in emerging economies and to minimise concentration risk on any single market.China's GDP has increased fourfold since 2003 and its share of the global GDP has more than doubled from 9% to 19%. Singapore's trade with China has also increased almost four times since 2003. Even in the area of tourism, the Chinese tourists account for about 20% of Singapore's total international visitor arrivals. So, I would like to ask the Minister as to how we can manage our economic exposure to China, balancing the opportunities versus the risks.Even without the COVID-19 outbreak, global supply chains are already showing signs of disruptions and are likely to be re-organised. How can we help our companies diversify their markets and adjust to the shift in supply chains to increase business resilience?Next, and still related to diversifying our economy, I would like to seek an update from the Minister on the progress of building new economic clusters. In particular, how have we leveraged on the technological advancements to open up possibilities in new sectors? Beyond agri-tech and sustainability solutions, are there more new growth sectors that we are developing?Continued rapid advancements in technology are likely to add to further disruptions and even lead to the demise of some sectors. We need to open up new industries and growth sectors to keep generating the positive deltas to our economy. Fostering new economic growth sectors can also help create new and more exciting jobs and it can help boost the overall productivity and innovations.We know that investing into new growth sectors carry significant investment risks. It requires sectoral expertise and talents, it requires products that meet the addressable markets, the necessary eco-system players and, importantly, the entrepreneurial acumen and aspirations.How can the Government facilitate the development of new growth sectors and its necessary eco-systems? What are the resources and support to be provided? In Budget 2020, the Finance Minister also mentioned about improving support for deep-tech startups. Can the Minister also share on how the Government plans to nurture and help promising startups?Next, on enterprise development. There are more than 200,000 enterprises in Singapore and they come in every size, different stages of growth, uneven productivity capabilities and resource adsorptions and varying value-add to the economy. Given this diverse enterprise landscape, a one-size-fits-all approach may not meet the specific needs and achieve the desired outcomes. How could our economic agencies work with the relevant stakeholders to provide differentiated support for different types of companies?A pro-enterprise environment is also a necessary condition for a vibrant and entrepreneurial eco-system. The Pro-Enterprise Panel (PEP) was formed in 2000 as a platform for companies to provide feedback on regulations. Is there scope to adopt a light-touch approach in regulations so as to encourage more enterprises to innovate and venture?Sir, In his Budget speech, the Finance Minister also spoke about the Next Bound of SkillsFuture, which includes enhancing the role of enterprises in developing their employees.Having employers take ownership in developing their staff is the most ideal situation. The companies know best the skills needed for their businesses to grow and transform. The employers are in the best position to manage the resources, time and space to upgrade skills. They are also in the vantage position to plan out and execute job re-design, which can align the necessary training and re-skilling to the business need.In that regard, can I ask how would the Government promote and support more of such involvement by companies to build their workforce capabilities?I applaud the Government for introducing the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package. It is the most tangible move to-date by the Government to help mid-career Singaporeans. It is another manifestation of the Government's commitment that economic growth must, ultimately, translate to good jobs and good outcomes for all Singaporeans. I hope that the hiring incentive to employers who hire local jobseekers aged 40 and above, through re-skilling programmes, would appeal to employers and also change their mindsets.Employers should leverage on this re-skilling programme to help enhance their workforce and yet also enjoy the wage support. So, I call on employers to discard any age biases that they may have in their HR policy and re-pivot to the new environment of higher retirement age.Finally, let me speak about our response to the COVID-19 situation.The first wave impact to our affected businesses, such as tourism, aviation and retail, has been very sharp and severe. The Stabilisation and Support Package has rightly focused on tackling two critical situations: firstly, the weaker cash flow position of businesses and, secondly, to focus on saving jobs.The announced measures of Jobs Support Scheme, rental waivers, rebates, temporary bridging loans, among others, are relevant and practical relief measures to help businesses, especially in managing the tighter cash flow situations. However, I am concerned that if this COVID-19 situation is prolonged, we may lose capabilities and capacities in the tourism sectors as operators may downsize or shut their operations. I hope that the Government would monitor this closely and be ready to extend and step up the assistance further.Given the severity of the outbreak in China, its economy is likely to take a major hit. If the situation persists, its production capacity would be curtailed and we could see serious disruption to the supply chain and this has wider and deeper implication and impact to the world's trade flows.On the demand side, slower growth in China is also expected to dampen consumption and investments. Singapore, like many economies, is unlikely to be spared from the further knock-on effects. How can we draw lessons from the impact of COVID-19 to build economic and national resilience?Question proposed.The Chairman: Mr Teo Ser Luck, you have three cuts. You can take them together.EconomyMr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol): Our economic growth is getting more and more challenging. I think each year, as we forecast our economic growth, you will realise that we keep revising our forecast. From last year to this year, we are revising downwards on the forecast. It is challenging, no doubt, and, with COVID-19, it is getting more and more challenging to actually get a part of the pie because other cities and economies are also getting more competitive.We are focusing on quite a few verticals and I know that we rely less on manufacturing now, which, in the past, was about 25% contribution to GDP. But right now, we are looking at it at 20% GDP. Although there is a lot of focus on precision engineering and some of the rest of the other sectors related to manufacturing, I think, for the long haul, it does not give as much stimulating growth to the economy as we need.So, that is where we are investing in technology startups or we are investing in financial services and all. However, for some of this growth, we are competing very intensively with other economies as well and that will pose a challenge to our economic growth as a whole. I think on a year-to-year basis, growing at 1.5% to 2.5%, we are sort of plateauing, although we are in better shape to do better than other economies.I would like to ask the Ministry whether there are immediate short-term to medium term strategies or any change to the current strategies that we have. With the 23 Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) that we have focused on, I do not think we can focus on all 23. But what are the key focuses that we can have in order to boost the economy forward, maybe the next three to five years of economic growth that can be greater than 3%? Because we have not seen anything before with 5% to 8% anymore. What are the other measures that we can put in?FTA ImpactWith COVID-19, I was wondering whether the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) can play a part? FTAs, in good times, actually help the SMEs, who understood FTAs and can launch their products overseas and get the full benefits out of them – tax incentives and other measures in regulations, in actually getting exceptions. But in not so good times, let us say, for example, right now, how do FTAs play a part? We have more than 25 FTAs signed so far – bilateral and multilateral. Where do they play a part? How can we use them more effectively? What can the SMEs do?Market Readiness AssistanceI think one of the most practical methods for businesses in Singapore to actually overcome some of these challenges, for example, some of the crises that we faced today and some of the growth challenges, will actually be using some of the schemes that we have. One of the schemes that is also a beneficiary out of it is the Market Readiness Assistance (MRA). I am glad to know that the MRA will be enhanced.The important thing about launching businesses overseas is, firstly, the regulations; secondly, the knowledge on the legal aspect, the framework; thirdly, it is finding a local partnership. Sometimes, it is not about funds, because MRA provides the funds. But it is the knowledge that is the most important. Where can we get this knowledge? Can MRA offer more than just funds, dollars and cents, but actually coming in with certain knowledge? Because we have Enterprise Singapore (ESG) officers all over internationally and they are very good officers. They can provide their facilitation of good help and networking. I think this is most valuable to the SMEs and businesses who want to venture overseas.So, can I know from the Ministry what are the enhancements of the MRA, and are we able to move from funds to knowledge that can be imparted to facilitate the growth of SMEs overseas?6.00 pmThe Chairman: Mr Douglas Foo, you have two cuts, take both together, please.Opportunities in ASEANMr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, ASEAN is widely seen to be on track to be the 4th largest economy in the world by 2030. This is driven by the continued economic growth and development efforts of our neighbours. In a study by the McKinsey Global Institute, especially for the manufacturing sector, disruptive technologies are projected to have huge economic impact, potentially creating US$25 billion to $45 billion of annual output value in ASEAN by 2030.ASEAN is an incredibly dynamic economic block with 10 economies at different stages of development. As the world embarks on a new decade with uncertainty as the opening number, this is a turning point for ASEAN to realise our ambition to be the next \"factory of the world\".There is definitely opportunity to attract foreign interest in ASEAN in the current uncertain global trade climate. Additionally, our member states need to encourage our companies to reinvest in the region to further spur on growth.In our recent dialogues with members in the Manufacturing community, in view of the current supply chain challenges arising from the COVID-19 outbreak, more businesses are seeking to explore longer term solutions for their businesses in ASEAN countries. This provides the impetus for Singapore businesses to take a closer look at the opportunities in ASEAN.As we continue ground efforts like leading mission trips and business meetings, are there any additional outreach or publicity efforts that will be undertaken by the Ministry to continue to highlight to businesses the importance and promise of our ASEAN neighbours? Because at the end of the day, by 2030, when we look back, we want our enterprises to have actually rode the journey of ASEAN having rose to being the 4th largest economy in the world.Trade and InternationalisationMr Chairman, answering the call by the Government, Trade Association and Chambers (TACs) have stepped up to play a much larger role in outreach and capability building in the business community. Within TACs, there is also a higher level of collaboration to collectively address key business issues.In July 2019, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) organised the inaugural Strategic Planning Session for TACs which was attended by over 70 leaders from more than 40 TACs. The TAC leaders had the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with Mr Heng Swee Keat, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. During this session, the TACs deep-dived into pertinent issues such as internationalisation, innovation and digitalisation, as well as how TACs need to transform to stay relevant for the future.On the manufacturing front, the Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF), the Singapore Industrial Automation Association (SIAA), and SGTECH have come together to form a Manufacturing Alliance in October 2019 to specialise in business model and process re-engineering, software and digitalisation as well as robotics and automation matters.The Manufacturing Alliance works with an ecosystem of partners, such as government agencies, Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), Centres of Innovation (COIs), and so on, to scope problem statements and curate standardised, modular implementation packages that are easy for SMEs to adopt to make progress on their journey towards Industry 4.0.As noted by Mr Ho Meng Kit, the CEO of SBF, with more complex challenges faced by our members, TACs need to change, adapt and innovate to better serve the community. As we continue to take on bigger roles, TACs are also beginning to face a number of operational challenges.In the circumstances, how does the Ministry intend to encourage TACs to pool knowledge and resources together both locally and in overseas markets to help businesses seeking to internationalise? Does the Ministry have any plans to assist TACs to upgrade their capabilities and human talent and make this a possible career choice for the workforce?Enterprise SchemesMr Charles Chong (Punggol East): Mr Chairman, there are many grants and schemes which are available to help companies. Now, these have been made available by the Government through various agencies to encourage a vibrant business community in Singapore. However, many companies, particularly Small and Medium Enterprises or SMEs, are often not aware of the grants available to them. Or if they know of these grants, the amount of red tape and the number of forms they need to fill in could also prove to be an impediment to applying for these schemes. Or there may be multiple overlapping and similar schemes, and it is hard for a business owner to decide which one to apply for. I am sure not many SMEs know of the existence of SME Centres, which have been specifically set up to help them.While SME Centres will be able to help SMEs navigate the various grants and schemes which are available, they may not be visible enough for the SMEs, such that SMEs actually reach out to them to tap on their expertise.My question to the Minister then is what we can do to make SME Centres more visible, such that we make it clear to SMEs that we have people ready and able to help them in their business journeys? More broadly, is the Minister satisfied that MTI is doing enough to ensure that SMEs are made aware of the grants, schemes and programmes available to them, and could more be done to ensure that SMEs do not lose out on these?Free Trade AgreementsMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member): Mr Chairman, Sir, Singapore has 23 implemented Free Trade Agreements or FTAs and may conclude other FTAs in future. Every FTA negotiation involves making a determination on how much improved market access to give foreign companies in exchange for market access for Singapore companies in that foreign country. Implemented well, FTAs can introduce a wider range of goods and services in Singapore at lower prices for the end consumer while also giving our local firms greater market access and a more level playing field abroad.I would like to ask before an FTA is concluded, how does the Government obtain feedback from relevant local firms about what problems they face with market access within that country, as well as what enhanced competition from that country's firms might mean for themselves, their industry peers and the domestic economy?Does the Government also review implemented FTAs to assess the net economic impact of the concessions given in respect of market access to foreign firms inter-corporate transferee rights and other concessions as well as whether market access for a Singapore firms has in fact materialised as envisaged under the FTA?Lastly, is there a mechanism for local firms to easily give feedback on FTA related matters and can some feedback channel be indicated on the FDA section of MTI's website? What processes are used to assess the net economic impact of FTAs after they are enacted? Is feedback gathered from local firms as to the analysis of prices of goods and services before and after? Is that kind of analysis done, for example?The Chairman: Mr Saktiandi, you have two cuts. Can you take both together?Enhance Internationalisation and TradeMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Thank you, Chairman. The COVID-19 situation is an unpleasant but timely reminder of the importance of diversification. It is dangerous to develop a reliance on one market. China has been an excellent trading partner with a vast market, offering generous business opportunities for Singaporeans across a wide variety of sectors. But with China taking a significant hit, many local businesses are also reeling from the impact. So, it is crucial set their sights on broader horizons and work towards them, or risk sinking.Fortunately, there is already the Market Readiness Assistance grant that was first introduced in 2013 to help businesses enter new markets, and also the newly announced Enterprise Grow Package. I am glad to note that those will be now enhanced with greater funding support and coverage.However, for companies entering a new market, and especially for those who are new to internationalisation efforts, they would feel quite lost and may not even know what they can do with the funding. I would like to ask how can support be enhanced, so that they can have a good and strong head start?Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) have been playing increasingly critical roles in driving transformation and growth. Being close to the ground, they have a firm grasp of their members’ needs and a greater understanding of the industry. They have in recent years helped their members to adopt new innovative solutions and technologies to transform their businesses. They have also worked closely with the Government to help members. It is evident that they will, and must continue, to take on integral positions in this next round of internationalisation.What other roles can TACs play in pooling knowledge and resources, both locally and in-market, to help businesses seeking to internationalise?Help Singaporean Workers Remain RelevantChairman, in the midst of this uncertain economy, our mature and mid-career workers, many in their 40s and 50s, are most vulnerable. With the recent economic challenges and rapid technological advancement, some of them are struggling to make their career transitions. I wish to acknowledge their efforts to make use of SkillsFuture and other excellent government initiatives to reskill themselves.Nevertheless, the climb is an uphill one. For every successful story, another shares his failed attempts to secure a good job despite months of networking, attending courses, seeking career guidance and so on.I hope the Minister will share with us further efforts to grow the economy and how this will translate to good jobs and outcomes for Singaporeans.In recent years, aviation, F&B, retail and tourism were booming. They were among the major sectors offering PCP and other mid-career transition measures. Today, government support is needed to help these industries tide over difficult times. I have confidence that this is only temporary and they will bounce back in good time.But for those who have made the transition or are in the midst of getting the relevant qualifications and training to enter these industries, I wonder if their employment prospects will be affected. Yet such global crises are impossible to predict. What else will be done to help workers remain employable and industry-relevant in the rapidly changing environment?I am glad that the Deputy Prime Minister reinforced his resolution in the Budget to move away from reliance on foreign workforce. I would like to take this opportunity to revisit my proposal on the Capability Transfer Programme (CTP) which I brought up last year during my Adjournment Motion to TAFEP and MOM.Second, there must also be greater effort and localisation efforts to support Singapore's competitiveness and workers' sustainability. May I suggest that the companies be encouraged to set localisation targets for their workforce? Localisation targets meaning proportion of workforce that is local or setting a target for overall local proportion. This can be targeted for a range of skills and may need to be company-specific or dependent. It could be, for example, incorporate elements of training for eventual local employment and with a specific localisation target, for example, in three to five years.The existing CTP supports firms to bring in foreign specialists to transfer capabilities to the local workforce, and to send locals abroad for training. The Ministry should consider expanding CTP and providing more resources to support the transfer of capabilities from foreign employees, who are already employed in Singapore, to local workers, with the aim of localising jobs. The foreign specialists that they bring in should mentor Singaporeans to take over or share the role.Funding support for CTP should be expanded to include salary and training support for local specialists, as well as Singaporean trainees on overseas attachments to acquire new capabilities. Can we also consider CTP to support transfer of capabilities from foreign employees already employed in Singapore to local workers, with the eventual aim of localising jobs, working in tandem with the localisation targets I had mentioned earlier?Upskilling, Re-skilling, Job RedesignMr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon): Chairman, in the face of significant economic and technology shifts, upskilling and re-skilling is paramount to good employment outcomes for Singaporeans. One can argue that success in both of these areas are some of the hardest public policy that few governments have succeeded in. There are several reasons and it is a complex issue.Successful upskilling is usually done by successful companies. Because successful companies are the ones who have a clear vision for the future, and therefore the skills needed to reach that future.They are also usually operating within a certain national culture, such as those found in Germany and Japan, where companies have a firm sense of responsibility to the long-term employment of the staff. This culture is usually supported by manpower policy at the national level.Upskilling also requires complementary educational institutes and capability for both full-time and part-time upskilling.If upskilling is difficult, re-skilling could be even more challenging. In fact, one would be stretched to think about more than a handful of countries that had systematically re-skilled people who are structurally unemployed.Re-skilling workers to do different jobs is somewhat easier for larger companies, because while they are learning these new skills, they are usually working within the same company, within the culture. For example, as DBS banks digitise, many of its front-line workers got a place to be re-trained within other parts of the bank.However, it is not always so easy to re-skill these people across the broader economy, because not many companies have the scale like DBS. Because in the interconnected world, international companies have the option of re-locating jobs outside Singapore, rather than re-skilling our workers. Because in this age of technology disruption, not all industries have a strong awareness of what is coming ahead and, therefore, workers, who are currently within or are trying to enter that industry, may not know what skills to re-skill on.Despite these major challenges, it is very heartening that our Government is taking this issue by the horns for many years now, not just within MTI but whole-of-Government, and also to do it in a tripartite manner. Therefore, can MTI share how the Government can help workers remain employable and industry-relevant in this rapidly changing environment, especially mature and mid-career workers, many in their 40s and 50s? For example, how can we upskill more workers in industry-relevant competencies, such as in the area of Design.The mindset of our workers is also pivotal. They must understand that in this day and age, careers are non-linear, and they must up-skill and re-skill themselves multiple times through their career.6.15 pmNevertheless, companies play the crucial role. Can MTI share how our Government encourage more firms to embrace a mindset shift, to see workforce transformation as a critical complement to enterprise transformation. Accordingly, how can the Government support and incentivise more firms, especially SMEs, to invest in training and redesigning jobs for worker? And how is the Government publicising such information in a systematic manner?Skills and JobsMr Desmond Choo (Tampines): COVID-19 outbreak has caused economic weaknesses and companies might be putting off the transformation work. Which are the industries that the Ministry expect to experience a longer recovery time? How is the Ministry helping these industries to continue the transformation?According to some SME bosses, during a downturn it is also the best time to transform. COVID-19 will eventually come to pass. But the realities of a rapidly changing economy are unchanging. Transformation is critical for a longer term survival. How is the Ministry helping these companies to accelerate workforce transformation?What are the benchmarks of transformation? Transformation would inevitably cause some of our workers to be left behind. This is especially acute amongst those in the 40s and 50s. How is the Ministry helping to keep them employable and industry-relevant?Many companies are reluctant to train because the workers might be poached. This mindset is perhaps the great obstacle to manpower transformation. I would like to suggest the training innovation from Amazon. Amazon's career choice programme helps workers to gain skills in areas outside of Amazon's needs by providing resources and work flexibility. Amazon pays 95% of education fees and work flexibility for workers to pick up skills in industries that are in demand and well-paid, regardless of whether those skills are relevant to Amazon or not. Amazon possibly gains because it is seen as a progressive company. It can possibly only retain the promising ones. The industry and broader economy gain from the more skilled workers and workers gain by better skills, better jobs and wages.We have many large companies in Singapore that have accumulated vast resources over time. If enough of them follows Amazon's example, it need not be a zero sum game of one company producing better skilled workers for others to poach. We can, in fact, grow the pie so that we can grow and benefit our workers collectively.Grooming Local TalentMr Leon Perera: Sir, I note the Government's announcement that 60% to 70% of the jobs created domestically in Singapore from Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) are PMET jobs. Going forward, it is important to support and develop Singaporean leaders in the private sector. To the extent that there are impediments to this, these should be understood and addressed.A number of programmes have been launched to nurture local PMET and leadership talent, such as the Youth Future Leaders' Programme by EDB and NTUC, the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative as well as the Enterprise Singapore-ASEAN Leadership programme.I would like to ask for an update on the programmes used to support companies in Singapore, including MNCs to develop a pipeline of local talent in PMET and leadership roles. What has been the success associated with such programmes to-date?Start-upMr Teo Ser Luck: Mr Chairman, Sir, every year we put a lot of emphasis on encouraging start-ups, either catalysing more start-ups in different areas in terms of tech or tech transformation but also in creating the hardware, for example, the Launchpad and several other places where it is clean tech start-up area. That is very encouraging and it is good to know that this year we are putting additional $300 million into deep-tech and with some focus on a couple of key areas, including agri-tech.The question I have is that I do see many other related Ministries or relevant Ministries also putting in some of the investments into start-ups and also into technology. The question I have is whether there is synergy between them. And when we put in additional funds into it, what are the key performance indicators or indicators of success for such funds? I do not think we can compare a public fund for investments of this like the private funds where their ROIs is in terms of the immediate returns or short-term returns. But what exactly would be the indicator of success for our funds?Secondly, it is that for the deep-tech start-ups, these have very long gestation period because it is long gestation period, it is very hard to forecast how far it goes. The question is the success is dependent on the commercialisation aspect of these start-ups because you do not want to invest in start-ups where it is just another science project. If it is another science project, then you come out of the lab but there is no commercial value, there is no demand.We have to put in some of these funds, for example, the $300 million additional funds put it into agri-tech, would the agri-tech in future provide a more comparative and affordable pricing for some of what it produces or these technology startups would be able to scale overseas, globally, have a commercial aspect to that. I would like the Ministry to be able to elaborate further on what indicators are there for such an assessment.Industry DevelopmentMs Foo Mee Har (West Coast): Mr Chairman, Singapore’s investment in economic transformation seems to be moving in the right direction.\tOverall productivity rose to 2.6% per year over the last three years, up from 2.2% in the preceding three-year period.The Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) aimed at fostering innovation, boosting productivity and deepening skills of workers in the respective industries is central to our economic restructuring effort. Yet when I speak to business leaders, they continue to lament that potential synergies and capability development, which ITMs could provide, remain under-leveraged.\tPerformance in industry transformation has been uneven across sectors.[Deputy Speaker (Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]So, I would like to ask the Minister what lessons have been gleaned from the implementation of ITMs thus far?\tHow can companies be better incentivised to band together and form alliances to develop industry-wide capabilities, build scale, go international and test sector-wide solutions?\tWhat progress has been made in the Government’s efforts to anchor key players in shared facilities and infrastructure to better support transformation and adoption of technology? And lastly, how can Government support the development of emerging sectors with good growth potential?Sir, from the substantial Government investments made in the economic transformation journey that started four years ago, there must have be – there must be useful learnings from sectors that have gained good traction.For example, what can we learn from manufacturers in the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries who have widely been recognised as the forerunners in the adoption of Industry 4.0 initiatives? MAS’s success in developing the Fintech sector and in instituting the concept of \"regulatory sandbox\" to spur innovation of new technology is also something that other sectors can emulate, to support experimentation and trials of promising innovations, with all the necessary safeguards.Sir, strong local capabilities and eco-systems for innovation is key to securing Singapore’s economic success and resilience.\tSMEs need a lot of handholding to engage in R&D.\tI would like to ask the Minister how SMEs can be supported in shortening their learning curve, embracing technnology and participating fully in R&D.What impact has the 10 Centres of Innovation (COIs) had on industry development?\tWhat outcomes have there been so far, of COIs in assisting SMEs? And how can university research and other research agencies support industry development in more substantive ways?Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat spoke about the vibrant startup eco-system in his Budget Speech. There are now 3,800 technology startups in Singapore. As Singapore now also a globally recognised leader of intellectual-property protection and scientific research centre, we should fully deploy our strengths to focus on supporting startups in deep-tech with research-based IP at its core.Deep-tech start-ups in emerging technology areas such as agri-food tech can grow to become globally competitive.\tHowever, these same startups also require larger investments, longer gestation periods, and not every investor has the stomach for the higher risks that come with this. So, I would like to ask the Government how are we going to support these startups.Mr Lee Yi Shyan (East Coast): Sir, one of the key trends shaping Singapore's future is the rapid advancement of technology. Artificial intelligence, blockchain, 5G, robotics and so on are poised to shape future industries. The emergence of Industry 4.0 and Services 4.0, are fast becoming the new global landscape.In fact, the on-going technology boom shows no sign of slowing. According to McKinsey Global Institute, up to 800 million global workers will lose their jobs to new technology by 2030. Earlier on, Deloitte and the University of Oxford predicted that 35% of the jobs in the UK in 2014 would go to robots in 30 years. Here in Singapore, many companies are trying to automate their operations without hiring more workers.While Singapore is making all efforts to transform, we may still be too slow for competition. Against this backdrop, I would like to ask the Minister, how has MTI, been preparing our enterprises and workforce to adjust to the new economic landscape? In leading sectors such as AI and Blockchain where we are short of a critical mass of talents and companies to play in the global game, have MTI agencies made concerted efforts to bring in lead players and top talents to catalyse our local eco-system development?Given that Chinese economy is now the second largest, and several of their IT and digital sectors are world-leading, has MTI been successful in attracting Chinese unicorns to be located in Singapore? How is MTI going to identify and attract would-be unicorns from China, India and ASEAN so that Singapore has a fair share of the future Asia unicorns, going forward?The Chairman: Mr Leon Perera, you can take both your cuts.Industry 4.0 Networking PlatformsMr Leon Perera: Mr Chairman, Sir, the challenge of navigating Industry 4.0 is all about attracting investments in future-ready categories like AI, drones, IoT and so on. But that in turn can be unpacked into several distinct challenges that need to be met to attract that investment.Firstly, creating a viable eco-system with financing and Government support.Secondly, creating access to a critical mass of workers with the requisite skills and risk appetite and in this we have to balance foreigners with the Singaporean Core.Thirdly, stimulating local demand for these products. While investments in Singapore would be to serve the region and the world, some local demand would help attract the attention of investors.And fourthly, creating network effects where interactions among players and industry, academia, research centres, Government and top leaders can take place, thus catalysing new ideas.To address the fourth challenge, why not catalyse the creation of networking platforms for distinct Industry 4.0 spaces like AI and IoT. One useful model could be the Product Executive Forum in Boston, an exclusive group for senior product leaders in that area. It brings together promising industry executives, academics and top leaders. It functions through breakfast seminars, round-tables and other events. Catalysing such a platform may be helpful. After all, in the Industry 4.0 race, it is not just about having the right people but also about those people interacting and cross-fertilising ideas and work streams.Energy SecurityNext cut on energy security. Mr Chairman, Sir, natural gas is the main way Singapore generates its electricity today. Indonesia accounts for 85% of imported natural gas in gaseous form with the remainder coming from Malaysia.Pipeline natural gas has been supplemented by imports of liquified natural gas (LNG) for some years now from diverse source countries. However, Indonesia has announced that it is to stop natural gas exports to Singapore from Sumatra in 2023. It was not too clear if pipeline gas from Natunas would be similarly affected but the statement emanating from Indonesia's Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry on 8 February would seem to suggest so. If this takes place, it will place some pressure on our power-generation sources. Renewable energy sources, mainly solar power, as well as regional power grids, would take time to build up.6.30 pmWould the Government share its mitigation measures in light of this? Can LNG imports, for example, plug any gap that emerges after 2023? We should also take this opportunity to improve the renewable portion of our power generation mix. I am heartened to hear about the decarbonisation measures spoken about by the Government in Parliament last week. My colleague, Mr Dennis Tan, outlined various perspectives and suggestions from the Workers' Party on environmental policy in his Budget speech last week.In conclusion, I would like to ask if the Government is studying two other energy possibilities.Firstly, there have been media reports about private sector plans to build a solar farm in Australia and export the power to Singapore via a subsea cable. Secondly, I noted Senior Minister Teo's statement on nuclear power at the PMOCOSthat the potential for nuclear power is still being studied. Russia and China are exploring floating nuclear power plants based on seaborne platforms, with Russia in the process of deploying one. It may or may not be a practical possibility for Singapore to derive power by such means in the foreseeable future. But is the Government studying the risks that such projects by other countries may pose to Singapore?Economic Transition to DecarbonisationMs Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): Chairman, climate challenge is an economic structural challenge for Singapore, noted Minister Chan Chun Sing, who further added that, I quote, \"If we cannot manage that, we cannot even attract the industries to create the jobs for the next generation.\"IMF recently opined that price on carbon should rise to US$75 per tonne by 2030 in large emitting countries, placing constraints and pressures on fossil fuel-based industries, Yet, new energy technologies are currently available.Would the Ministry consider (a) conducting and publishing stress test exercises specific to the petrochemical industry to understand growth risk under different scenarios of global carbon policy; (b) evaluating the potential for job creation,cost of living and environmental impact around carbon capture and storage, solar PV, nuclear, importing renewable energy, increasing industrial energy efficiency; and (c) developing a clear plan of economic transition to reduce our reliance on high carbon risk sectors, including actively involving our oil and gas industry before 2030.Sustainability of IndustriesMiss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan): Chairman, let me begin by declaring that I am a senior executive with an industrial gas and engineering company.The physical effects of climate change are increasingly visible on the environment, society and the global economy. Climate change is not a distant threat; it is happening now. Increasingly, people want to know if you are part of the problem or part of the solution.To achieve the commitment in the 2015 Paris Accord of reducing Greenhouse Gases (GHG), it will require changes in societal behaviours, Government regulations, industrial engagement and technology development.There has been much discussion on emission reductions focused primarily on high carbon footprint industries, specifically the petrochemical and manufacturing industries. Before we focus on any individual, we must first put in perspective and recognise there are many parts in the entire value chain before the GHG emissions.Take, for example, hydrogen gas. Energy is required to produce hydrogen. But hydrogen is an essential ingredient to produce low-sulfur fuels to meet even stricter environmental standards, thereby reducing the sulfur emissions into our environment. Hydrogen technology can also be used as a transformative energy carrier or as clean fuel for mobility and transportation.It is important to understand whether the products being produced, the manufacturing processes used and the industry value chain on the whole actually have a larger benefit to the society in terms of carbon productivity, support sustainability and how they help to avoid more GHG emissions on a net basis. Further, we have to ask if the industries invest in new technologies that drive operational efficiency, thereby reducing GHG, adopt usage of renewable energy sources in their production that shape the energy transformation, re-use the waste streams or capture the carbon emitted for alternate usage. Whether the industries are working towards decarbonisation that contributes towards managing climate change is key.Planning and facilitating transitions towards \"cleaner\" modes of operation and to cleaner industries would result in significant economic impact in terms of jobs,cost and overall operations. No industry is spared from the effects of climate change and all sectors have to play their part in mitigating the effects of climate change. As such, our ITMs, which are the roadmaps for growth and competitiveness for our industries, should include sustainability as an essential component of their workplan and transformation.I would like to ask how can we prepare our economy for the ramifications of climate change and reduce our carbon emissions in a sustainable manner? Will MTI consider including sustainability as a fifth pillar of the ITMs?Relatedly, will MTI consider creating a platform to facilitate exchange of best practices for emission reduction across all major sectors of Singapore's economy, given the success of tripartite collaborations like the Singapore Packaging Agreement? Through this, companies can harness the best knowledge, balance their obligations to all stakeholders to continue driving their financial performance while being a good steward of our environment.Marginal Return to Productivity SpendingAssoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, the Government has implemented many policies to boost productivity growth. Recent schemes include the Productivity Solutions Grant, Enterprise Development Grant and Automation Support Package. Budget 2020's Transformation and Growth strategies continue these efforts.How effective are each of the recent productivity growth grant schemes, in terms of the marginal return to public spending and the impact on industry and jobs? To what extent can we attribute recent improvements in Total Factor Productivity growth to these policies?MTI's Economist Service publishes excellent research on the effects of various industry policies. Could the Ministry develop a mandatory programme evaluation framework for all major productivity enhancement schemes? Each scheme should have a logic model that defines target outcomes prior to implementation. Evaluation results should be published at clear intervals, such as at the mid-term and shortly after the conclusion of the scheme. The most important schemes should have their evaluation results subjected to academic peer review to enhance credibility.Technology-driven innovation can improve productivity, worker welfare and make jobs more desirable to Singaporeans. In a recent working paper, Prof Ivan Png from NUS studied a supermarket chain in Singapore that redesigned the cashier's job to focus only on scanning groceries. Payments were handled by automation. Switching to a scan-only job format improved worker welfare and boosted local recruitment. It also improved scanning-speed productivity by 9%. Prof Png's research highlights the importance of carefully scrutinising the effects of technology improvements.We should not spend such significant sums on productivity transformation without an equally strong commitment to understanding whether such efforts arecost-effective and meaningful.Enterprise Transform PackageMr Douglas Foo: Mr Chairman, in Singapore, SMEs account for an estimated two-thirds of all employment and contribute almost S$200 billion to the economy. SMEs form an integral part of our economy and are seen as the future drivers of Singapore's growth. With the number of SMEs constantly hovering at above 200,000 companies, there is, understandably, a wide range of companies all at very different stages of growth.While there is a host of support for start-ups and small SMEs, understandably which are more vulnerable, it is timely that we look into investing and supporting SMEs which have managed to show a good track record and are ready to embark on the next stage of growth.With the announcement of the Enterprise Leadership for Transformation Programme as part of the Enterprise Transform Package, I believe this is a good extension of our current SME support framework.The Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) stands ready to assist to reach out to this community. I strongly believe that Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) can be a useful platform to reach out to these business leaders and engage them with new initiatives such as this.With its aim as providing training to business leaders, the Enterprise Leadership for Transformation Programme is one for the long-term – to enable and develop capabilities. The Budget Statement talks about grooming 900 business leaders over the next three years. May I humbly please ask the Minister: how will these leaders be identified? Are more details available on the plans for the training and mentorship framework? How can TACs continue to help on this journey.?The Chairman: Mr Teo Ser Luck, you can do both your cuts.Enterprise DevelopmentMr Teo Ser Luck: Mr Chairman, MTI was very clear in strengthening the local enterprises and I believe they have a pyramid where most of the enterprises at the bottom were actually lower in revenue numbers – micro-enterprises and then small, medium and large. This is a very good pyramid to show. Although we have over 200,000 SMEs in Singapore, every one is in its different places and most of them are actually micro enterprises. And I understand that MTI's strategy is quite clear. Those who move the needles, there is a lot focus on them. And some of those who move the needles, they are actually large companies. And we have a Scale-up Programme within MTI or EIG to help these companies to be strengthened. So, for example, what Mr Douglas Foo has mentioned about training the leaders, as well as after training the leaders, they make a transformation within a company and strengthen the company.But you might realise that a lot of the medium sized companies, even to the smaller sized companies, not micro enterprises yet, but smaller ones to the medium sized ones, they have a lot of potential. The Scale-up Programme today, if I am not wrong, actually comprises most of the very large companies or companies that have above $100 million revenue. But the medium enterprises and the small enterprises might have the innovation, technology, concepts and plans or very passionate and enthusiastic entrepreneurs or founders that run them that could potentially make them global. Would the Scale-up Programme include these enterprises as well, from the small to the medium size and have a larger wastage for them?Heartland EnterprisesAnd I would like to speak more about the micro enterprises as well. If those who have potential, we can grow them. But you know that some of them at the heartlands who are micro enterprises may not have the chance at all. They are just looking for survival. But these micro enterprises at the heartlands, we call them \"heartland enterprises\", they have both a commercial and also a social impact on our lives. Having lived in an HDB estate for more than 25 years, there are a lot of the shops that I still visit today and that personalised approach keeps them going. Several of us continue to patronise those shops and they continue to be there.I know that MND and MTI are trying to spruce up these heartland enterprises. One of the major things they do in the past few years was upgrading the hardware facilities, the surroundings, hopefully, to capture the foot traffic. But you know, it is not just the hardware that we should upgrade. Maybe, it is the software as well. It is about helping these heartland enterprises maybe about a centralised inventory planning, financial planning, product innovation. And some of these things actually matter – bringing them online and become more e-commerce focused. And this may help them to draw in more customers instead of looking at just the foot traffic because, if it is just the foot traffic, they compete directly with the heartland malls and their prices. So, they may not have a chance to position themselves.Would the Ministry consider looking at the heartland enterprises and look at the software aspect to actually put in the funding to help them?DigitalisationMs Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar): Chairman, during this period of the COVID-19 outbreak, people are taking precautions and minimising contact by avoiding crowds where possible. This crisis provides an opportunity and the motivation for our smaller, especially the simpler and more traditional, businesses and enterprises to adopt digitalisation for their operations.However, many of these business owners would need help and I would like to request that the Ministry provide the additional support to our heartland enterprises to digitise and go online. Can the Ministry provide the expertise and guide them towards any support grants so that they can serve more customers through this relatively new sales channel? For example, there are many more people now who prefer to have their meals and groceries delivered to them. I hope the Ministry will take this opportunity to help more of our heartland enterprises move towards digitalisation.Consumer MattersMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten): Sir, I declare my interest in speaking on this topic as the President of the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE).I have three points for MTI's consideration regarding consumer matters.Recently, there were several complaints recently regarding retailers selling face masks at substantially higher prices. This action of retailers taking advantage of consumers and profiteering during the COVID-19 outbreak is simply unacceptable. May I ask the Minister how many retailers have been queried by the price controller? What action would be taken against such recalcitrant retailers? What else can MTI do to warn businesses that they should not profiteer and should not take advantage of consumers during uncertain times? CASE will be happy to continue working with MTI to educate and empower consumers to know more about their rights and to protect themselves from unscrupulous businesses.Next, it was recently reported in the media that some consumers were cheated when they tried to buy face masks online via Carousell. Last year, I asked MAS to work with the Association of Banks of Singapore (ABS) and credit card issuing banks to raise awareness of charge-back schemes. And this will enable consumers to seek refund from their credit card banks if they encounter a dishonest online vendor. After all, banks that provide banking facilities for their merchants have a better knowledge and control over their commercial partners. May I ask what is the status of this request to MAS and ABS?6.45 pmFinally, under the Consumer Protection Fair Trading Act, if a supplier engages in an unfair practice and refuses to sign a Voluntary Compliance Agreement not to continue its unfair practice, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) may apply for an Injunction against the recalcitrant supplier. Before applying for an Injunction, CCCS needs to conduct an investigation and take statements from consumers. The process is quite tedious and not all consumers will want to spend their personal time giving statements to CCCS and appearing in court as witnesses. Sometimes, if the consumer needs to be publicly identified as someone who was taken advantage of, the consumer may rather not be embarrassed.I am of the view that consumers will be more forthcoming if they do not have to worry about having to go to Court all the time. Will the Government consider amending the CPFTA to allow CCCS to have wider options of imposing administrative financial penalties instead the current option of only seeking an injunction against egregious businesses? The Competition Act has a financial penalty framework; perhaps a similar framework can be introduced for the CPFTA. Will MTI consider?The Chairman: Leader of the House."

        "Content": "Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [26 March 2020],\"That the Ministerial Statement made by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance on Additional Support Measures in Response to COVID-19 Pandemic be considered by Parliament.\" − [Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance]Question again proposed.10.26 amMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten): Mr Speaker, Sir, many of my fellow colleagues have spoken in support of the Resilience Budget and the Solidarity Budget announced by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance. I add my voice to their support.I believe that all these additional budgetary measures will go a long way to assuring Singaporeans from all walks of life that the Government is doing its utmost best to help Singaporeans cope with the pandemic. In the current situation, many Singaporeans whom I speak to appreciate the difficulties facing Singapore. They urge the Government to persevere in finding a solution for the COVID-19 crisis and gave their assurance that they will work with the Government to break transmission. In simple Chinese, they say \" \"I am confident that with the right political leadership and with strong support from our civil service, we will be able to overcome all challenges. I acknowledge that many of the additional measures can only mitigate the financial struggles to hit Singaporeans.Whatever the Government does, it will not and should not be seen as a measure to put Singaporeans back to the days before the COVID-19 crisis. Nevertheless, I have two areas of concern which I wish to highlight for the Deputy Prime Minister's consideration. Many of my residents are affected and I speak for them.Under the Jobs Support Scheme, JSS, the Government will co-fund the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each local employee for nine months. For April, the co-funding is 75% of the employee's monthly wages, up to $4,600. However, IRAS' website says that the wages paid to business owners or employers trading in their personal capacity will not be eligible for the payout.This means that business owners who are directors and shareholders of the companies will get no help at all. They are not considered as self-employed. They are also not eligible for any financial support for the self-employed. Many of them may be just small businessmen who own a small share in a company or a $1 share. And they are also working as directors in the company. They too have their families to support. They too have mortgage instalments to pay. During this period, if their businesses are badly affected, surely, we can offer some help to these people by co-funding the wages of the working directors.Next, while I appreciate the announcement by the Deputy Prime Minister yesterday to enhance the help given to eligible self-employed and to increase the annual value of the properties to $21,000, may I urge the Deputy Prime Minister to review the criteria? Many self-employed persons who have done well in previous years have bought a property of higher value and they may now be reeling under the negative impact of COVID-19. The fact that they have invested in their dream home, which is more expensive, does not mean that they will suffer less due to COVID-19. In fact, they may well be struggling even more to pay more in terms of their mortgage instalements. For some of these self-employed persons (SEPs), this month, April, this month of suspension of activities mean they would have absolutely no income at all. So, for the SEPs who run retail shops, if they are self-employed housing agents, if they run their own tuition agencies, they will earn nothing this month and yet not receive any help under the JSS, just because they live in a more expensive condominium.So, I urge the Government to allow appeals on a case-by-case basis and to render assistance to this group of people during this difficult time. Sir, I support the Supplementary Budget measures.10.30 amDr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar): Mr Speaker, Sir, it is probably not an exaggeration to say that with more than 200 countries affected, probably close to four billion people now on lockdown, the COVID-19 crisis is possibly the worst catastrophe the world has faced since the Second World War.Besides tackling the medical crisis, governments around the world are rolling out emergency stimulus and support packages to keep their economies afloat. These packages range from less than 1% of their GDPs to as high as 32%, for example, in the case of Germany.At 12% of our GDP and close to $60 billion, our Supplementary Budgets – the Resilience and now the Solidarity Budgets – lies probably in the middle ground. Still, it is by any measure an enormous package and quite unprecedented for us.On one hand, this massive injection of funds helps to boost confidence and goes some way in tackling the current and near-term economic challenges. And as we enter today into the first day of this circuit breaker measure, our fight against COVID-19 here in Singapore enters a critical phase.It is reassuring to hear from Deputy Prime Minister Heng that the Government is able to and prepared to do even more in the future should the crisis drag on, as seen in the further measures just announced under the Solidarity Budget.However, on the other hand, we all know that our reserves are not unlimited and some had urged caution about dipping too deep into our national savings, although virtually all the people I have spoken to or I have interacted with over the past weeks have expressed appreciation for the various assistance schemes. The worry is that no one knows how long this crisis will last and that we might need more funds further down the road.In the meantime, we must, of course, all do our part to minimise further spread of the disease and continue contributing to our community and economy in a socially responsible manner.For many of us, one of our biggest monthly expenditures is mortgage repayments on our homes and MAS has announced that homeowners may apply to defer repayments for their residential property loans until the end of the year. This is of course good news to owners under financial pressure due to the impact from COVID-19. They can choose to defer just the principal amount or both the principal and interest payments. No interest will be charged on the deferred interest payments. However, they must take note that interest will continue to accrue on the deferred principal amounts. I understand that it may be difficult for the banks and finance companies to consider waiving interest on the principal amounts. Nonetheless, I hope MAS and the Government will consider persuading them to implement a reduced interest rate over this deferment period on those deferred amounts, or at least not to charge interest on the deferred principal amounts. This is probably in line with the fact that lending rates across the board are slowly reducing over the next few months.This special deferment arrangement also, to my knowledge, does not currently extend to individuals with commercial or industrial property loans. While owners are encouraged to discuss debt restructuring with their lenders, some guidelines for relief measures for this group would be helpful; and this way, the owners may, in turn, be able to extend arrangements for relief to their beleaguered tenants as well.Next, I would also like to appeal for a little bit more assistance under the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme. I know that some new measures have just been announced under the Solidarity Budget. But I would like consideration, perhaps, to be made for further help for SEPs who have more dependants. Of course, currently, we now know that under this scheme, SEPs will receive $1,000 a month for a total of nine months. Would MOM consider taking into account the number of dependants supported by the SEPs? SEPs supporting young children, elderly or disabled family members would probably require additional financial assistance during this difficult time. For SEPs who are also not auto-enrolled in the SIRS, I hope that the application and appeals process will be as expedient and as inclusive as possible.Next, I would like to also bring up the special plight of private hire drivers. In the early days of the COVID crisis, there had been some calls in some quarters for those who had seen reduced employment, or been furloughed, to consider supplementing their income with private hire driving. With this recent drastic reductions in social interaction and travel, many private hire drivers, along with regular taxi drivers, are facing severe constraints on their daily income. Whilst taxi companies have announced rental rebates and waivers for their drivers, many private hire drivers are still bound to their rental agreements, and some who have taken private leases on their vehicles are also finding it difficult to service these loans. I think for the latter, the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill, which was just introduced, should address some of these concerns. But I hope that he relevant agencies can work together to address these areas of urgent concern.As to my final area of worry, with the anticipated reductions in disposable incomes, I would also like to ask if more help can be extended to lessen out-of-pocket expenses for essential medical services.Despite very generous Government subsidies, many Singaporeans still need to pay a portion of their medical expenses. During this trying period, more families’ finances will be stretched. Hence, could I ask whether the Government would consider a temporary, extended liberalisation of MediSave for both outpatient and inpatient essential medical treatments, and also for ILTC expenses? Now, this would not entail any immediate further expenditures for the Government. MediSave has also been looked upon as every citizen’s individual reserves for medical care, and surely the current economic climate provides a mandate to dip into this personal cash reserve for necessary medical use?Next, for the Medication Assistance Fund – both the MAF and MAF Plus – would the Government or MOH consider increasing the level of subsidy for morecostly medications, up from the current band of between 50% and 85%? While these subsidies are generous, again, due to the highcosts of certain drugs, the balancecosts borne by patients and their families can still be fairly significant.I would also like to seek clarifications regarding MediShield Life premiums. Insurance policyholders can now apply to defer premium payments for up to six months while maintaining insurance coverage. May I assume that MediShield Life and integrated plan policies could be included as well?In addition, would MOM consider allowing SEPs to defer their MediSave instalment payments during the current climate of economic difficulties?Last but not least, I hope that the eligibility criteria for MediFund will be loosened temporarily during this contagion period to assist patients who may not qualify during more regular periods.Finally, I would like to end by again thanking the Deputy Prime Minister, all the Ministers, civil servants, frontline workers for all their commitment and the hard work during this especially trying time for the nation. All of us are behind you and thank you for your hard work.Regarding our battle against SARS in the early 2000s, I recall a quote from the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew who said that: \"We were united as one people\", this was during SARS, \"to protect the health and safety of everyone. The experience bonded us as one people regardless of race, language and religion\". This COVID-19 crisis, terrible as it is, offers us another chance to emerge stronger as one nation and one people, and stronger we will be. SGUnited, SG Together. And I would like to conclude with my support for this Budget.10.38 amAssoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member): Mr Speaker, Sir, we are facing a rapidly evolving crisis. No one alive has seen a global pandemic of this scale, and none can accurately predict how the global economy will look like after the COVID-19 pandemic. This is why the Government is taking extraordinary steps in the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets to inject some certainty, some confidence into the economy and our society.Singapore is very fortunate that the prudence and hard work of our forefathers and past governments have left us with public reserves to help us through the current phase of the crisis. This illustrates how important it is for a country to maintain healthy financial reserves and a strong economy. The reserves also allow the Government to act quickly and decisively to support the people and the economy, which may not be achievable otherwise.However, none can predict how long the crisis is going to last or how much of our reserves we will deplete. Singaporeans cannot tide through this crisis by relying on our public reserves alone.Sir, the true strength of Singapore is not just in our reserves or in the strong balance sheet of the Government. The strength of Singapore must lie in the willingness of our people to make the necessary sacrifices to protect the weakest among us from the COVID-19 pandemic.Mr Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the Singapore economy. Minister Desmond Lee noted last week that 60,000 Singaporeans have applied for the Temporary Relief Fund. Globally, unemployment claims have risen at rates far exceeding those during the Global Financial Crisis. Initial jobless claims in the United States for the week ending 28 March 2020 were over 6.6 million – an increase of about 30 times over the average rate the year before. The jobless data, moreover, do not account for reduced hours, cut allowances, reductions in commissions and no business for the self-employed.So, there are many Singaporeans in immediate need, and many more to come. The Solidarity Budget’s cash payment of $600 to all adult Singaporeans will make a significant difference, as will the Temporary Relief Fund, and other financial support measures. But because many measures are means tested to avoid waste, there is a real risk that Singaporeans will fall through the gaps. The rapidly evolving effects of the pandemic also mean that our schemes, carefully designed as they are, may be one step behind the needs of the public.That is why we must now consider shifting our approach from means testing and gatekeeping public support, to ensuring that all Singaporeans, on a universal basis, have some basic income necessary to provide for their families in the months ahead.Mr Speaker, I want to call on the public and the Government to consider implementing a temporary Universal Basic Income Scheme that provides weekly cash payouts to all Singaporeans for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. But more than that, I want to call on the public to make a sacrifice to finance this scheme through a temporary increase in personal income taxes. If we truly believe that we are only as strong as the weakest member of our society, we must be prepared to pay the price necessary to protect that fellow Singaporean.I have worked together with Dr Ong Qiyan from the Social Service Research Centre at the National University of Singapore, to produce a concrete proposal on this Universal Basic Income Scheme. We call this scheme the Majulah Universal Basic Income Scheme, or MUBI, for reasons that I will explain shortly.The MUBI Scheme’s key objective is to give all Singaporean households the certainty that they will be able to pay for basic necessities during these uncertain times. MUBI achieves this by giving all Singaporeans weekly cash payments without means testing, calibrated at the amount necessary to cover an average households’ cash expenditure on food, utilities, and telecommunications. Our initial proposal is to pay $110 per week to all Singaporeans for a period of 12 weeks, starting immediately if possible, through existing electronic payment channels for Government's cash transfers to Singaporeans’ bank accounts. This willcost $4.62 billion dollars. The payout period can be extended at additionalcost if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to severely disrupt the economy past these 12 weeks.But to ensure that the most help goes to those most in need, the payouts can be recorded as personal income, which will be taxable in the Year of Assessment 2021. Hence, the scheme’s net benefit to each Singaporean will eventually depend on the recipient’s taxable income in 2020 and their tax rate.So, the key feature of MUBI is that all Singaporeans will receive payouts for daily living expenses immediately. But the taxes to finance those payouts will only be paid next year, according to the usual schedule for tax payment.We have calculated that MUBI requires a temporary personal income tax increase of 4.25%. Even after the tax, the bottom half of taxpayers will benefit. The MUBI payment will be larger than their expected increase in taxes next year. The median taxpayer will also benefit on net if they have Singapore citizen dependants, as the full MUBI payout will be given to children and seniors, who are generally not taxed. Taxpayers who suffer a sharp drop in income due to COVID-19 will benefit because their taxes could drop below what they receive in MUBI payouts. For solidarity, high-income taxpayers will be asked to contribute to financing MUBI, unless they suffer a significant income loss due to COVID-19 or have many dependants. In that case, then the tax structure ensures they will not pay much.We call this the Majulah Universal Basic Income scheme for descriptive and symbolic reasons. In essence, MUBI will advance income from the future, when the economy and jobs are expected to recover, to the present, when it is needed the most.But MUBI will also be a symbol of how Singapore comes together to ensure that those hit hardest by the crisis are provided with vital benefits in this time of need. Through the tax system, more fortunate Singaporeans, who retain their earning capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic, will help less fortunate Singaporeans who suffer reductions in earnings.Mr Speaker, a universal benefits scheme without means testing will address the critical needs of Singaporeans today. Incomes and jobs will be volatile over the next few months. A family that is financially secure today may not be so next month.Means testing, moreover, is often based on lagging indicators. It may be based on income tax records, housing annual value and it may not reflect present finances. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are unpredictable, so it will be difficult to identify today which sectors, which jobs, will be affected the most, even though we know many people in aviation, tourism, retail and F&B, have already been hard hit.The universal approach will provide some assurance to everyone that there would be some income regardless of their circumstances. This approach is also equitable because many of our affected sectors have already made sacrifices to ensure the safety of other Singaporeans during this crisis.The certainty of having weekly payments to help put food on the table also means that Singaporeans will never feel pressured to choose between feeding their families and protecting public health. This will help Singaporeans follow public health advice, especially if that advice may hurt their livelihoods. For example, some Singaporeans provide essential home-based personal services such as home repairs and air-conditioning servicing. Not all will be confident they can protect their health and that of their customers. MUBI will allow such Singaporeans and many others like them, to decide, based on the risks at the time, to reduce or halt their services, instead of getting more business just to feed their family.Mr Speaker, there are also administrative benefits from implementing an automatic, universal payment scheme, instead of a means-tested scheme. We need to preserve the time of policymakers and social service agencies to assist Singaporeans affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in other ways.When social workers have to navigate through different assistance schemes to find what is the eligible set of aids for each client, this takes up time and energy which could be better used for counselling and supporting clients. Our social workers also need time to respond to emerging issues. Social isolation measures in many countries have triggered an increase in family conflicts and violence, which may well occur in Singapore during this circuit breaker period. Other social problems that may worsen include the social isolation of elderly Singaporeans and care-giver stress syndrome, as many daycare, support and respite services have shut down. These issues require not only timely interventions, but a social service sector with the bandwidth to proactively identify potential problems and implement prophylactic measures.More importantly, policy-maker attention and time is a scarce resource. The potential flashpoints caused by the rapid development of the pandemic and measures other countries take to control it, require extensive coordination, leadership and creative thinking to develop the optimal response. MUBI saves policy-makers' time and bandwidth as it requires less inter-agency coordination and limits fine tuning of the policy to one dimension – the payment amount.Mr Speaker, we faced two key design questions: how much should MUBI pay out and how should MUBI be financed?We focused MUBI on the daily living expenses that receive less support from existing Government schemes, namely food, utilities and telecommunications. While food is an obvious necessity, utilities will alsocost more now that people spend longer hours at home. Telecommunications is also necessary, as work and learning must now take place online. Telecommunications also helps people to stay in touch with family and Government agencies; and provides basic home entertainment, which helps keep people at home.We did not include housing and medical expenses as these are already supported by other Government schemes. We did include utilities despite U-SAVE support because thecosts could rise sharply if people work more from home.Mr Speaker, we computed the daily living expenses based on the most recent Household Expenditure Survey data. We looked at four expenditure categories: one, food and non-alcoholic beverages; two, hawker centres, food courts, coffee shops, canteens, kiosks and street vendors; three, utilities and other fuels; and four, telecommunication services.Based on the data, a MUBI payout of $110 per week, per citizen, is sufficient to cover basic living expenses in these categories of at least 60% of all households. The actual average per-capita expenditure is $105 per week and two-thirds of this is on food. To ensure that we covered vulnerable groups such as the elderly, we also referred to the 2019 Minimum Income Standards study led by Dr Ng Kok Hoe of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. Their estimatedcosts in these categories for elderly households were similar to ours. So, we believe that payouts of $110 per week, per person, will cover the most vulnerable Singaporeans.Mr Speaker, we can finance the proposed benefits by asking Singaporeans to accept a temporary tax of 4.25% on personal chargeable income above $20,000. Based on Year of Assessment 2018 tax data, the MUBI temporary tax increment will raise $4.467 billion, which is just short of projected MUBI schemecosts of $4.62 billion. But the Government will also have to absorb the risk that tax collections next year will be much lower than expected, if the recovery is slow and prolonged.Sir, I know that asking Singaporeans to pay more taxes in the middle of a crisis may seem insensitive. But I am asking those who are fortunate enough to retain their incomes, to pay more the next year, to support those who cannot survive today. You will only pay for MUBI, on a net basis, if you kept a high income throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.Mr Speaker, let me outline how MUBI would in practice help Singaporean households. First, MUBI is progressive and it helps lower income taxpayers more. For example, let us look at a lower income taxpayer, who earns about $30,000 a year. They will receive $1,320 in MUBI payouts this year and they will owe about $200 more in taxes the next year. So, they keep about $1,120 of the MUBI payout once all taxes are paid.For the median taxpayer, who earns about $58,000 a year, the MUBI benefit is just $100 more than the temporary tax increase. For the median taxpayer, MUBI really just helps to bring their income forward to cover any short-term problems due to COVID-19. But, if they have dependents, it will help even more. I will explain shortly. A high-income taxpayer will pay more in taxes than they receive in MUBI benefits. If you earn about $110,000 a year, you will help pay for one and a half other Singaporeans to receive their MUBI benefit.Second, MUBI helps support households with dependents better. Nearly half of Singaporeans, such as our children, elderly and homemakers, pay no income tax. But they would receive MUBI payouts. This means that a median income taxpayer with two dependents would get a total MUBI payout of nearly $4,000 this year, but only pay about $1,200 in tax the next year on this.Third, MUBI gives automatic insurance against unexpected drops in personal income. A taxpayer keeps more and more of the benefits, the more their income is hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic. The median taxpayer with two dependents keeps 95% of the payouts if they were to lose half of their income during the year.Mr Speaker, the MUBI scheme is a fundamental shift that we propose from the standard means-tested welfare system used today in Singapore and in many other countries. While means testing can help target social protection benefits to those who need it the most, means testing can be complex, administrativelycostly, and it may deter recipients from seeking and receiving the necessary help.The severe economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis will stretch social safety nets throughout the world to the breaking point. Our means testing systems will be an expensive distraction for social services agencies and policy-makers at a time when the very structure of our economy and society is under threat. Means testing also runs the risk of letting Singaporeans fall through the gaps, or asking Singaporeans to make impossible choices between protecting public health and earning a living.The MUBI scheme therefore makes cash payments on universal basis to cover basic daily living expenses, because we cannot predict which Singaporean will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic next and to what extent. We must be prepared to extend help to all Singaporeans and we must give that help before our fellow Singaporeans even realise that they need the help.The MUBI scheme is also financed on the principle of solidarity, because all Singaporeans must face the COVID-19 pandemic together. Therefore, all Singaporean taxpayers are asked to contribute towards financing the scheme. Some will give more, but all will give some.Mr Speaker, I know the Government has rolled out a comprehensive set of measures in the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets that will help Singaporeans make ends meet. I fully support those measures and the hard work that went intof them. But we can innovate. If the damage caused by COVID-19 persists we must do more. In this spirit, we propose the MUBI scheme. Majulah Singapura!10.55 amMs Foo Mee Har (West Coast): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to start by thanking Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat and his team at MOF for working relentlessly and tirelessly on successive packages in response to the rapidly escalating COVID-19 pandemic. From the Unity, to Resilience, to Solidarity Budgets, it is clear that the Government is listening hard and responding with great competence, boldness and heart.The resources needed to fight this escalating crisis seem unending. More than 3.9 billion people or half the world's population have been asked to remain in their homes to combat COVID-19. After battling the virus for over two months, with successive restrictions, Singapore too, joined those confined to their homes, in an effort to slow the worrying growth rate of unlinked local cases.Whilst I fully support these enhanced new measures, designed to be circuit breaker to arrest the escalating infections, such restrictions will incur significant economiccosts in addition to imposing a severely constrained way of living on everyone. The Solidarity Budget proposes that another $5.1 billion be spent to save jobs, support businesses and families during these extraordinary four weeks, with $4 billion of that coming from our Reserves.No one is sure how widely the COVID-19 pandemic will spread and when it will peak. Containment may take longer than currently projected and no country has seen a clear path to recovery. Even China, which has seen its reported infections dwindle, has urged their citizens to avoid non-essential outings and has continued to discourage foreigners from entering, in order to prevent a resurgence of infections. Without widespread availability of a viable vaccine, the removal of restrictions on economic activity is likely to be painfully slow. The longer the duration of lock-down, the more complicated the resumption of economic activity will be.I would like to ask Deputy Prime Minister what he plans to do if our efforts to contain COVID-19 is not successful and circuit breaker measures need to be extended or even tightened? Would he extend a similar set of support measures?It is at times like this when we feel grateful of the privileged financial position Singapore is in, endowed as it is with the wherewithal to weather this storm. Our reserves have enabled Deputy Prime Minister to act decisively when the nation faces such extraordinary circumstances.The lion share of Resilience and Solidarity Budgets will go towards the Job Support Scheme in order to save jobs and protect people's livelihoods. I am pleased that the Government chose to bear the fullcosts of savings jobs with wage support, instead of cutting CPF. After the previous CPF rate cut in 2003, it took eight years for the employer contribution rate to be restored to 16%. I hope we can continue to safeguard CPF for our workers in this crisis.Despite the strong efforts on Job Support Scheme, less than half of the Singaporeans polled by The Straits Times believe that the measures would be enough to rescue jobs. In the US, the COVID-19 \"freeze\" is expected tocost 47 million jobs and send the unemployment rate past 32%, according to St Louis Fed projections. With such grave outcomes being predicted in other parts of the world, I would like to ask Deputy Prime Minister about his outlook on Singapore's unemployment – both the base case as well as worst case scenarios? Even as we work relentlessly to mitigate the scale of retrenchment and rise in unemployment, I would like to ask Deputy Prime Minister whether he has in mind a limit to which the reserves should be tapped?There is no historical precedent of the type of economic dislocations that we are experiencing. More are drawing parallels with the trauma wrought by World War II or the Great Depression. I would like to ask Deputy Prime Minister for his view on the nature of this crisis – how different it is from past crises and the challenges that he believes Singaporeans and the enterprises will need to face.Mr Speaker, Sir, many of the support schemes in the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets are broad-based to provide for cash flow during this time of crisis. I note that some countries, such as Australia, eligibility for wage support only kicks in if business turnover drops by 30% due to the pandemic – so there is an eligibility criteria. And for larger companies with turnover of more than A$1 billion, their drop in turnover must be at least 50% before they are eligible.Whilst I agree with the broad-based approach Singapore is taking, it is incumbent on companies who enjoy disproportionately greater benefits to “do the right thing”, and share these benefits with their business partners, employees and the wider eco-system, in the spirit of solidarity.Sir, let me share one example. Food delivery platforms such as Grab and Deliveroo typically charge 30%-35% in commission fees. This means food outlets need to pay an exorbitant one-third of customer receipts, in fees to delivery platforms, as commissions for delivery. Judging by the compensation that delivery platforms pay their riders and charges they impose on consumers for delivery, I think this seems excessive.Owners of food outlets have told me that the high commissions are barely tolerable during \"peacetime\". However, with the onset of COVID-19, deliveries have now become the dominant portion of their business – indeed, the only mode of business from today, for at least a month. Under these circumstances, payment of such commissions renders the sustainability of food establishments untenable.Some relief is provided by the recently launched Enterprise Singapore’s package to support F&B players by funding 5% of the commissioncost. I urge, and I really urge, GrabFood, Food Panda and Deliveroo to do their part – review their commission model and foster more equitable sharing ofcosts and benefits with food outlets owners, riders and consumers.I believe it is in the delivery companies’ interests to adjust their commission rates, so that food outlets may have a fighting chance to survive. As for delivery riders who \"brave\" the deliveries to ferry our favourites to us at home, we as consumers can also play our part by giving them a little extra. Should those of us who can afford it not consider tipping our delivery riders 5%-10% of food receipts as a discretionary \"service fee\"? We can all do our part to keep Singapore’s treasured, unique and colourful food culture alive.In the coming days, more relationships between parties will need to evolve and creative new models that benefit all stakeholders must emerge. I hope such solutions will be developed by businesses themselves, without depending on the heavy hand of the Government or the law. It is regrettable that we have to enact new laws to compel landlords to pass on property tax rebates to tenants.Sir, I commend the coordinated efforts of MAS and the financial industry to roll out probably the biggest restructuring of household and corporate debt in Singapore’s history, providing individuals and businesses relief in cash flows. The relief package offered by banks and insurers, to defer repayment of loans as well as insurance premiums until the end of the year, will be a lifeline for many impacted. It will also help financial institutions reduce risks of delinquencies and bankruptcies, by sharing the burden of debt with individuals and SMEs.However, I was surprised to hear from Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat during a Parliamentary Question yesterday, that the SME Working Capital Loan Programme has so far helped only 662 enterprises and the Temporary Bridging Loan interest rate is as much as 5% despite the Government’s risk-sharing at 80%. This contrasts poorly with Switzerland’s crisis loan scheme to SMEs, where over 76,000 small businesses availed themselves of more than SFr 15 billion in the first week of launch, at zero interest.I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for announcing risk share to 90% and that banks and finance companies may also apply for low-cost funding through a new MAS Singapore Dollar facility. With these strong Government interventions, I would like to ask if MAS can prescribed a much lower interest rate chargeable such that there is more take up, and boost SMEs chances of surviving this storm and ease their recovery with less debt burden.Finally, Sir, the impact of coronavirus hits everyone. Many of our PRs are part of Singaporean families and have contributed socially and economically. They are hurting too. In solidarity, could the Deputy Prime Minister consider giving them some help, even if not the full $600, means tested on a case by case basis, and applicants can be asked to show that they are part of Singaporean families. Also there are many Long-Term Visit Pass holders who are spouses of Singaporeans. Many of these families are not well-off. They would certainly appreciate this, even if it is just a fraction of $600.Mr Speaker, Sir, it is clear that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be felt for quite a while. The Unity, Resilience and Solidarity Budgets provide comprehensive measures for individuals and companies to build capabilities for the eventual recovery at all levels. Despite our best efforts, some companies and jobs will disappear, but new ones will emerge. Those who stay resilient in the face of hardship and adversity will be rewarded, when a new dawn breaks.As we face the mighty storm together, for days, months or even years, our shared sense of identity and solidarity will be our greatest strength. Every generation of Singaporeans has been defined by its own crisis; each has come through stronger and more united than before – this challenge is ours to face down, as one united people. Together, I am confident Singapore will prevail. Sir, I support the Budget.Mr Speaker: Minister Grace Fu.11.08 amThe Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien): Mr Speaker, the livelihoods of many Singaporeans in the arts, culture and sports sectors have been badly affected by COVID-19. Arts and sporting events, and CCAs, were cancelled or postponed even before the new circuit breaker measures that take effect today, 7 April. To deal with this unprecedented crisis, the government has introduced additional measures to protect livelihoods, help businesses overcome immediate challenges and strengthen economic and social resilience. Fifty-five million dollars has been set aside for an Arts and Culture Resilience Package (ACRP) as part of the Resilience Budget. We will: (a) protect livelihoods and careers in the arts, culture and sports eco-systems; (b) invest in capabilities that will position ourselves well for the post-COVID recovery; and (c) digitalise these sectors to create new markets, provide new job opportunities and ensure that Singaporeans can continue to benefit from the arts, culture and sports.We must first protect the livelihoods of our arts, culture and sports practitioners. They have been badly affected. Individual professionals, such as freelancers, may tap on broad-based relief schemes like the Temporary Relief Fund and SEP Income Relief Scheme or SIRS, and defer their income tax payments and mortgage instalments. Depending on individual circumstances, an eligible arts or sports freelancer may potentially receive $12,000 from May to October 2020 from SIRS and the Enhanced Workfare Special Payment among the broad-based measures in the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets, even before factoring other schemes.For companies, the Deputy Prime Minister announced that the Government will co-fund 25% of the wages of every local employee under the enhanced Jobs Support Scheme or JSS, which will last till end 2020, and 75% for the month of April, in view of the heightened measures. This will support all eligible companies and employees in the arts and culture and sports sectors. MCCY will announce additional support for major companies, as well as leading arts and culture groups, shortly at a later date.To help companies and businesses further defraycosts, all eligible tenants in MCCY-owned properties – be they in the arts and culture, youth, or sports – will benefit from the two months of rental waiver announced by the Deputy Prime Minister. This will benefit more than 300 tenants. These measures will provide some immediate relief for our arts and culture companies and allow them to use this period – when they are working from home – to plan for the future with greater assurance and certainty.To further support employment in the sports sector, as part of the SGUnited Jobs Initiative, we have identified more than 500 temporary job opportunities for various roles in the sports sector to support our national sports associations (NSAs), sports centres, academy and clubs as well as to support digital and exercise-science related capabilities. While many of these jobs will not be available while circuit breaker measures are in place, we are preparing them now so that we can start hiring as soon as these measures are relaxed.Beyond relief support, we will invest in retaining and upskilling the arts, culture and sports professionals. We want to protect and sustain the breadth and depth of skillsets and talents in the eco-systems as much as possible. Practitioners in these sectors will already benefit from the $500 to $1,000 SkillsFuture Credit top-up, and the SEP Training Support Scheme. I encourage our practitioners to hone their professional skills, and explore new complementary skills through the many online courses that are available from home.For the sports sector, we have been working with partners to build up the range of Continuing Coach Education or CCE courses to upskill our coaches and instructors. When the situation allows, coaches and instructors can avail themselves of more than 3,000 training opportunities by end-2020. This is in addition to the more than 2,000 ActiveSG SkillsFuture training opportunities currently available to coaches and instructors. These courses are either free or well covered by training grants from SkillsFuture. We will progressively make more training programmes available to individuals in the sports sector. We will also set aside $100,000 for the Coach Development Grant, up from $30,000 in previous years, to cover coaches’ registration and course fees when they sign up for CCE courses.Arts and culture freelancers, as well as those in the wider creative sector who provide important complementary expertise such as sound and lighting professionals, hold essential capabilities for our arts and culture eco-system. The Arts Resource Hub or ARH under the National Arts Council or NAC, has been set up to promote employability and sustainability of freelancers’ careers by providing resources and services. The ARH has been engaging and surveying a wide range of cultural and creative freelancers over the past months to better understand their profiles and the impact of COVID-19 on them. It helps us refine our range of shared resources and services, and provide reliable and relevant information to help them tide over this difficult period. Freelancers who have experienced contract cancellations can also seek advice from the ARH.I strongly encourage all cultural and creative freelancers to sign up online with the ARH, at nocost, to enjoy the convenience of a centralised point-of-contact.This is the time for companies to invest in their employees. The Enhanced Training Support scheme announced by the Deputy Prime Minister provides absentee payroll to employers who send their employees for training in SkillsFuture courses and is open to companies in the arts, culture and sports sectors. In addition, arts and culture organisations can apply for further support under the expanded Capability Development Scheme for the Arts or CDSA administered by NAC, to send their employees for professional-led training courses, beyond those endorsed by SkillsFuture. In the coming months, NAC will list more online courses which are eligible for CDSA support. We have enhanced the CDSA so that Major Companies can now receive up to $20,000 for training, while other arts groups can receive up to $6,000. Up to 200 companies will benefit from this.In addition to organisations and their employees, we will also support the training of up to 6,000 freelancers through the CDSA. These freelancers can apply for the CDSA to participate in a variety of courses, including local and international online courses. These include masterclasses in graphic communication skills in outreach with digital media, courses in creative writing, music production and studio recording. NAC will invite suggestions on training programmes and welcome courses by our own major arts companies and established professionals who are keen to offer their skills and experience in their areas of expertise. Our freelancers can receive up to $1,000 for their training, which can cover both course fee subsidies and a training allowance of $10 per hour. Just like companies and their employees, freelancers can also use this time to apply for the CDSA and use it to take online courses, or for future training.Arts, culture and sports lift our spirits in these difficult times, and sustain our emotional and physical well-being. To ensure Singaporeans continue to have access to the arts, culture and sports during the next few months, our culture and sports agencies will be releasing digital content to engage Singaporeans even as we stay at home, provide enjoyment for the entire family, and encourage them to keep fit. Interested audiences can view available offerings at NAC’s A-List website, an integrated platform featuring cultural offerings from our cultural institutions, arts groups and artists to offer greater access and connectivity for audiences. A-List is already available with many exciting programmes. I urge Members to check it out.We also want to step up on-going digitalisation efforts to enhance capabilities of the arts and culture, and sports sector, create new experiences for audiences and participants, and expand economic opportunities. Beyond bringing their products online, we see that it is a good time for the sector to acquire technical skills in data analytics, audience sensing, online marketing and more.For the arts and culture sector, we have established a Digitalisation Fund to support arts and culture groups and practitioners, cultural institutions, and cultural festival organisers to go digital with their arts and culture content. NAC will offer a new Digital Presentation Grant for the arts of up to $20,000 per project, to ramp up efforts in digitalisation of arts and culture content and delivery. This will be open to all arts and culture groups and practitioners, including freelancers. Artists and arts groups offering student-facing programmes including NAC Arts Education Programme (AEP) providers are encouraged to apply to NAC for this support to create digital content that can be offered for online use by schools. While some ideas may only be possible to execute after the circuit breaker measures, I encourage arts and culture groups and practitioners to prepare and submit their grant proposals now, so that they can bring their best work to Singaporeans once the situation improves. NAC also welcomes proposals which include creative means to develop digital projects while fully working from home.The Digitalisation Fund will support large-scale digitalisation of existing festivals and projects. We are committed to continuing with our annual large-scale festivals through digital means. As far as possible, we will hold digital editions of Singapore Heritage Festival in June, Singapore Writers Festival and Arts in Your Neighbourhood in November, followed by Singapore Art Week in January 2021. They will involve virtual arts and culture presentations, workshops, and tours. NAC and Arts House Limited will work with local arts groups involved in the Singapore International Festival of the Arts 2020 to explore how they can offer innovative arts and culture experiences digitally later in the year.The Digitalisation Fund will also support the digitalisation of our museum exhibitions and collections. The National Heritage Board (NHB) will progressively make available virtual exhibitions of the galleries at our national museums and heritage institutions, so that Singaporeans and international visitors alike can experience and learn about heritage without leaving their homes. NHB will also be working with Museum Roundtable members to support similar projects, and assist them in building up their digitalisation capabilities.We hope to roll out digital offerings by our arts groups in the coming months through multiple platforms and festivals. We aim to generate demand for the arts and culture sector, support over 200 new digital projects, and create more than 1,000 opportunities for our cultural and related practitioners once the circuit breaker measures are relaxed.SportSG will leverage technology to continue to engage Singaporeans in sports events and activities in this period. It will set up the ActiveSG Circle, a virtual sports centre in the form of an online platform. This will enable citizens to stay connected and active with an expansive offering, a wide offering of content such as exercise videos, programmes, talks, workshops and even races through a virtual space. For this year’s Get Active! Singapore, we will also offer a new $2 million grant to support more than 50 projects for sports SEPs and businesses to develop initiatives that create digital and virtual content and provide innovative ways to deliver sports for Singaporeans to stay active and fit in the lead-up from now to National Day in August.Mr Speaker, allow me to say a few words in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]In this challenging period, MCCY will strive to help our arts, culture and sports sector overcome the impact brought about by COVID-19. We will introduce a $55 million Arts and Culture Resilience Package (ACRP) to help protect jobs and maintain livelihoods. First, Deputy Prime Minister had earlier announced that the Government will co-fund 25% of the wages of every local employee under the enhanced Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) till end of this year, and 75% for the month of April when \"circuit breaker\" measures are in place. This will benefit all eligible companies and employees in the arts, culture and sports, sector. MCCY will also provide additional support for major companies, as well as leading arts and culture groups. More details will be announced at a later date.Next, all eligible tenants in MCCY-owned properties will benefit from the two months of rental waiver, to help lower theircosts. Also, we want to quicken the pace of digitalisation efforts of the arts and cultural sector via the new Digitalisation Fund. Finally, we also want to encourage arts organisations and practitioners to upgrade their skills, and be ready to bounce back stronger than before during this period. As such, we will enhance the National Arts Council’s (NAC's) one-time Capability Development Scheme for the Arts (CDSA) to benefit more arts and culture organisations and practitioners, including freelancers, up to end of 2020. The Arts Resource Hub (ARH) under NAC will continue to promote sustainability of freelancers' careers by providing shared resources and services, including advising them on various support schemes by the government, to tide them over this difficult period.(In English): Mr Speaker, if I may summarise. The relief packages announced by Deputy Prime Minister provide financial support to the individuals affected, sustain the eco-systems of these sectors by minimising the loss of capabilities, and raise the capabilities of the sectors in the physical and digital spaces. Individuals can benefit from financial reliefs, such as the Temporary Relief Fund, SIRS for freelancers and the COVID-19 Support Grant; training subsidies and grants in the Capability Development Scheme for the Arts to build their long-term capabilities. They will also benefit from the temporary jobs SportSG will be making available.Companies can benefit from wage support measures such as the enhanced JSS, and the Enhanced Training Support scheme and the CDSA. Our push to digitalise these sectors will provide economic opportunities to both individuals and companies, and allow them to continue bringing arts and sports experiences to Singaporeans. These schemes will be relevant even when circuit breaker measures are applicable, and will help us emerge stronger.Everyone has a part to play to overcome the situation we face. We are in this together, and the arts, culture, and sports communities must work together, work with the public, to protect the safety of our patrons, students and audiences. I urge larger and more established groups with deeper capabilities to help the smaller ones and individual practitioners, and ask that corporations, foundations and members of the public continue supporting the arts and culture and sports. All of us should take this time to prepare, with agility and resourcefulness, to welcome our audiences and students again with better creations, better works, greater competencies and broader outreach.Our arts, culture and sports sectors have proven their resilience time and again. I am confident that they will be ready with our best shows, most creative content, and highest quality classes once Singapore is ready for us, so that arts, culture and sports will be an even more important part of people’s lives. COVID-19 is a test and we will rise to the occasion.Mr Speaker: Mr Dennis Tan.11.28 amMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member): Thank you, Mr Speaker. The COVID-19 pandemic, with the effects of lockdown or stay-at-home orders, has brought a standstill to businesses all over the world and Singapore has not been spared, too. Beyond aviation, tourism and F&B, most industries and sectors in Singapore have been affected, some earlier than others. The effect on economies worldwide will be an unprecedented one, possibly worse than any global economic downturns we have ever seen since the Great Depression. The economic fall-outs may go on for quite a while after the COVID-19 pandemic has been tamed.I declare my interest as an SME owner. As the businesses of our SMEs are affected, many Singaporeans they employ are in turn affected. Under the Resilience Budget, the Jobs Support Scheme extended greater assistance to specified sectors, such as aviation and tourism and F&B sectors, giving 75% and 50% support for wages up to the first $4,600 of each of their staff wages for these respective sectors for nine months. The remaining businesses only received a flat 25% of their staff wages up to the first $4,600. While the aviation, tourism and F&B sectors may be badly affected, the vast majority of our SMEs outside of the aviation, tourism and F&B sectors lament they will get much less than the 75% or 50% wage support received by the priority sectors. Who is to say that businesses in other sectors are not as badly affected or will not be as badly affected?While the wage support for the Jobs Support Scheme under the Solidarity Budget has been boosted to 75% for all businesses for the solitary month of April and will be welcomed by all, for many businesses, it may only mitigate part of the losses expected from the enforced month-long closure of workplaces starting today.Since the Resilience Budget has been proposed on 26 March, has any study been done to assess the grave effect the pandemic has or is about to have on all business sectors?Let me share one example of a troubled sector here.On 24 March 2020, the Government announced that all centre-based tuition and enrichment centres will be suspended. The reason given is the need to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools and enhance the safety of our students. This brings to a stop the daily bustling activities that take place in our tuition and enrichment centres during both weekdays and weekends.While some of the tuition centres may have resorted to online learning, yet online learning has not been able to completely replace many of the pre-existing programmes in the tuition centres and enrichment centres. Some programmes may not be suitable for online learning. Some tutors, are for various reasons, not able to convert their face-to-face programmes to online modules. Some parents are also, for various reasons, not keen to convert existing programmes to online learning or even via Zoom, when offered. Many parents prefer traditional methods of personal teaching.Habits and mindsets will always take time to change, but that is scant comfort to businesses suffering the sudden shock to their businesses brought about by the abrupt ban. For centres who may not have locked in their students' subscriptions for a longer time, having chosen to collect fees on a monthly basis, they face abrupt loss of revenue as some parents have not continued to pay the fees.Learning service providers to MOE schools and to pre-schools are another group of SMEs in the education industry which have been affected from an even earlier time, with all outdoor programmes and all large-attendance programmes being cancelled in early February and co-curricular activities (CCAs) in March. Given the requirements in pre-schools that trainers cannot teach in other schools concurrently and students of different classes cannot share the same enrichment classes, many enrichment classes had to be cancelled from February onwards, with many left without any revenue.Besides a significant loss in revenue, these SME businesses still face the pressures of premise rental and staff salary. The Government's offer to pay 25% of the salary of their staff up to the first $4,600 under the JSS – which is just a few percentage points above the amount of employer's CPF contributions the employers will have to pay for each staff per month anyway – may assist to a certain extent, but it may not be significant enough to save jobs – the reason stated by Deputy Prime Minister Heng for the Resilience Budget. How will the Government provide greater assistance to these businesses?At this point, let me touch on one further aspect of the Jobs Support Scheme or JSS, again. The JSS is not applicable to one category of employees – employees who are shareholders, partners or sole proprietors of businesses even though they may take a salary as an employee of the business.I understand that in the private education business, there are many people in such a position – sole proprietors, partners or company shareholders of their businesses – who are at the same time registered employees of their business. Those such persons can be regarded as self-employed in some ways. The Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme is not applicable to them as the scheme stipulates that there should not be any employee income.I believe that this situation is not unique to the private education business. There are many in our micro-SMEs in other industries or sectors who are in the same situation. On Sunday, I met one of our residents, who runs a phone repair business and who is in this exact position. How would the Government help these affected Singaporeans?Yesterday, it was announced that all pre-school operators are to provide 50% refund of net school fees for non-attendance during the circuit breaker period. Parents will no doubt welcome this announcement. For parents who send their children to MOE Kindergartens and pre-schools run by anchor and partner operators, including those run by PAP Community Foundation (PCF) and NTUC, they are already entitled to various subsidies. But for other SME operators, where Singaporean parents only get the standard subsidies, or for faith-based kindergartens, where there are zero subsidies, the net refund that these operators must cough up is relatively much higher as the net fees payable are higher compared to MOE Kindergartens and those run by anchor and partner operators.In some cases, the total refunds will likely be higher than the 75% wage support received by way of the JSS. Furthermore, many operators had to incur extracosts recently to have additional manpower to cover for those on Leave of Absence (LOA) or five-day medical leave, and for extra cleaning works.I have dealt in some detail on the private education industry. However, it is but one example out of many businesses which have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis. With the circuit breaker announcements, things will get worse for many businesses in the coming month or longer, especially the many businesses that do not thrive on working remotely.The property tax rebate, together with the savings by way of the rental rebate, will be helpful in some ways to alleviate the sharp pain, and so will the Jobs Support Scheme. But will it be enough to ensure the survival of the business and to save jobs?Retrenchment has already started in different industries. Just last week, one of our residents, who is a chartered accountant in his 30s, shared with me that he has just been retrenched from a mid-sized accounting firm and is struggling to find employment in his industry.Indeed, if business is down, businesses will struggle to pay all their business expenses until a certain level of business has resumed – especially many SMEs, who may have precious little to sustain their business expenses, including rent and income beyond a few months. This economic crisis is likely to hang over the world for quite some time. Beyond the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets, how will the Government assist businesses and Singaporeans to stay afloat in the coming months and beyond?Before I move away from businesses, I would like to seek some clarifications regarding arts businesses.With the cancellation of entertainment, our flourishing arts professionals have to cancel their plays, musicals, concerts and other performances, and shows, which may go on until the end of the year. When performances are cancelled, there are no ticket sales and corporate sponsorships are often cancelled – not to mention that in these difficult times, it is challenging to expect support from many corporate sponsors. Many of these arts businesses are registered charities. May I clarify whether such arts businesses, i.e. those registered as charities, will be entitled to the same wage support under the Jobs Support Scheme as available to other businesses? If not, what is the corresponding assistance being given to this group of arts businesses?Mr Speaker, Sir, I move on to certain aspects of the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS). May I ask how did the Government arrive at this figure of 100,000 self-employed persons?In MOM's paper titled \"Labour Force in Singapore 2019\", it was mentioned that in the year ending June 2019, and I quote from paragraph 1.1.9, \"211,000 residents were engaged in own account work as some form of employment\" and own account workers were defined in the same paper as, and I quote from paragraph 1.17, \"individuals who operate their own business or trade without employing any paid employees\".The Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme will be open to those who earn a net trade income of no more than $100,000, live in a property with an annual value of no more than $13,000 originally and do not own two or more properties. While it is good that the $13,000 annual value limit has since been raised to $21,000 yesterday. In principle, the concern with setting a figure – a limit – at all, on this is that we are talking about a special economic crisis situation caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has developed suddenly. These self-employed people see their livelihoods being adversely affected in a short time and require quick and immediate assistance from the Government, regardless the nature of their residences.The property that they live in or own or co-own may not be relevant to their current income and earning capacity as well as most relevantly, their present position of suffering from sudden financial problems due to the COVID-19 crisis. If they own such property, is the Government expecting such self-employed people to sell their property quickly? If so, is it really fair or realistic to expect such persons to sell their homes immediately in such a market condition? This is different from the usual situation of people applying for financial assistance due to longer term employment and so on.May I also clarify whether this relief is open to those who live in such property above $21,000 annual value but do not own such property?Next, I move on to help for our taxi and private hire drivers.It is already a well-known fact that our taxi drivers and private hire drivers are suffering from a huge drop in business. I would like to seek some clarifications regarding the Point-to-Point Support Package for taxi drivers and private car hire drivers.I would like to know whether it is true that the Special Relief Fund under the Point-to-Point Support Package is only available to taxi drivers who work under the auspices of a taxi company or for private car hire drivers who work with Grab or GoJek?A resident who has a private car hire licence and serves his own source of customers had checked and was told that he did not qualify. If it is true, may I know the rationale behind this?A private hire car driver also shared with us at our Meet-the-People Session in Hougang last week that the incentives that come together with the Special Relief Fund may come with conditions imposed by his company that are impossible to fulfill in this economic climate. He asked whether the Special Relief Fund can be paid directly to all registered private hire drivers instead. I urge the Government to look into this.On the issue of landlords passing on savings from the property tax rebate and rental waivers granted under the Unity and Resilience Budgets, I am glad that the measures are being taken to ensure landlords' cooperation. However, I would like to ask what measures are being taken to ensure that tenants will share any property tax rebate or rental waiver savings they obtain from landlords with their sub-tenants, including the newly announced increase in rental waivers for Government-owned properties?Now, be they tenants or sub-tenants of Government-owned, private, commercial, industrial or office properties, what can sub-tenants do to ensure that they get to enjoy any rental rebate passed on to the tenants by the landlords? Are coffeeshop store-holders in this position as well?Finally, I would like to ask the Government to look at how we can extend better protection to many elderly Singaporeans working in hawker centres and coffeeshops as well as those elderly working as cleaners against the risk of the COVID-19 virus as I believe that they are the most vulnerable group – the elderly. For example, could the Government look into whether they could take more measures to ensure that these elderly hawkers and workers will have better protective equipment and safer working environment?Mr Speaker, Sir, in closing, the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic fallout resulting from it are likely to be here for quite some time. I look forward to the Government rendering more assistance to more of our affected Singaporeans and SMEs.Mr Speaker: Mr Leon Perera.11.43 amMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member): Mr Speaker, Sir, in my last speech in this House, I talked about seeing the opportunities in this crisis. What a difference a month makes. I will not talk about opportunities this time. The focus should be on getting through this to the other side – a post-COVID world. Other things should not distract Singaporeans from this mission right now. Before I begin, I declare my interest as a CEO and a shareholder in a company providing research and consulting.Sir, many of us feel fear right now. I would argue that what we should fight is not fear. Rather, we should fight the twin evils of indifference, complacency and unscientific views, on the one hand, and unbridled panic, on the other. A little fear may actually be helpful, keeping us on our toes and mitigating the risk that bad habits will return at the first sign of good news. But it should be a little fear for everyone and not only a little fear for ourselves. That should come from trust in the scientific view that if most people get sick, no one will be safe as individuals and families.As the famous scientist, Neil deGrasse Tyson, recently said, this COVID-19 crisis will put to the test a key question: does society listen to scientists? We all have a role to play in answering that question as a country. All of us react differently to an event like this based on our personalities, medical profiles, socio-economic circumstances and many things besides.It is easier for some of us to work from home than others, for example. Recognising these differences means accepting that there will be questions, there will be discussions, there will be debate, trade-offs and, yes, course correction. It is unity that will ultimately breed success in this effort but it is understanding that will beget unity. It is openness and accountability that will get us to understanding and it is our democratic society enshrined in our pledge that will beget openness and accountability.On social media, there are many chat threads openly saying that authoritarianism has worked, democracy has failed. Look at China versus Italy and the USA. Yet some of the countries that have done well through this crisis thus far, like Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, have open democratic systems. We would do well not to draw the wrong conclusions about democracy as many who lived through the Great Depression of the 1930s did, with disastrous results for the world.Sir, the Resilience Budget is to be welcomed. This is what the reserves principal has been saved to do. The Workers' Party supports the idea of not touching the reserves principal except in times of crisis, as I said in Parliament last month. On that note, I would like to ask the Finance Minister of the $48 billion Supplementary Budget and the $4 billion of enhancements. Firstly, how much was obtained from drawing down past reserves. I believe that was $21 billion, which begs the next question. How much was obtained from drawing on the surplus from this term of government? Thirdly, has the surplus been drawn upon fully with this Supplementary Budget? And fourthly, how much was obtained from other sources and what are those sources?Next, I will speak about a few issues and potential gaps.First, Sir, on the most vulnerable in our society. For those who are homeless I know that wonderful not-for-profit organisations (NPOs) like Homeless Hearts of Singapore, New Home Community Services and many others are stepping efforts to help this vulnerable group. What are the outreach efforts being put in place by MSF and other arms of the Government? And what support has been given to NPOs to ensure that these extremely vulnerable people can access medical and economic support at this time.Secondly, on those staying in HDB rental flats. Over the past four years has been my privilege to work with our volunteers to deliver assistance of various kinds to those living in rental flats in Serangoon and Bedok. Some of our beneficiary families have done all right. Two of our beneficiary families recently had children who qualified for entry to an Autonomous University. I cannot tell you how gladdened I was and how that cheered our volunteers. Yet, others are not doing so well, and face multiple issues that hinder them and their children in the pursuit of flourishing life. For those on ComCare awarded for a period of a few months, renewals are often an extremely stressful experience. The Government has said that their eligibility for ComCare will be eased during COVID-19. My Parliamentary colleague Mr Faisal Manap has also spoken on this issue and made a few suggestions, with which I agree. I would like to ask will the Government confirm that it will defer HDB rent hikes, allow HDB rent payment deferment and extend the current ComCare arrangements wherever needed, at least for a decent runway amidst this crisis, say six months. Now would be the time to be pragmatic and not ideological about such questions.Next, on our SMEs and micro-businesses. We need to get by until the economy comes back with pent-up demand. During this time, we should do everything practicable to keep viable SMEs and micro-businesses alive. If they are wound up, those entrepreneurs may not return, hurting employment and long-term economic growth potentially which needs entrepreneurship to balance other sources of innovation and investment.The Supplementary Budget has a host of measures for government risk-sharing in loans to SMEs. What if the loans do not get to our SMEs, in spite of risk-sharing. What if our banks simply do not lend. Our business eco-system does not have the deep historic ties between regional banks and SMEs seen in countries like Japan, Germany and Switzerland that are useful at times like this. Would the Government consider a scheme like what has been introduced in the UK – the Term Funding Scheme – under which participating banks that lend to SMEs get to access lower wholesale fundingcosts from the central bank. Of course, banks could still choose not to lend but at least this would tilt the balance towards our SMEs.Of course, many SMEs do not want to take on loans due to pessimism about their ability to repay after the crisis. And this is where job support and rental deferment play a role in preventing businesses from closing down, perhaps never to return. In cases where deferred rent cannot be paid back, will the Government provide clear assurances that it will consider providing very much extended deferment where there is evidence of the company's viability. Extended deferment could be made conditional on the company paying back at state, if and when it returns to decent sustained profitability.Next, on masks. Reusable masks are to be self-collected at RCs and CCs. Anecdotal and social media feedback suggests that some people are reluctant to collect these masks for various reasons including inertia and fears about potential exposure. Some wonder why self-collection was used when all are told to stay at home unless absolutely necessary.When I asked Minister Lawrence Wong about this in the context of distributing surgical masks in February, he said self-collection was used to minimise wastage. Our healthcare professionals do not need reusable masks, or do not need them as much as they need surgical masks; and hence, one assumes there are fewer pressures on that stock. Moreover, not that many masks are needed per household since they are reusable. If the Government does not want to mail these masks out, can we at least arrange to mail reusable masks to those who prefer to receive them by mail. Those who click on an online site or an app using SingPass, for example, or calling a hotline.Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, I should focus about the lessons we can learn from this crisis to better prepare for the next one, whenever that may happen. Governments around the world are asking companies to shift R&D and production resources to make masks and ventilators. What powers does the Government have to compel domestic firms here to do the same? Even if legal powers are not deployed, is the government using its powers of persuasion and purchase to nudge domestic manufacturers to produce more of such critically needed items which may raise healthcare system capacity and scalability? Now might be a good time to test our ability to get such things done for when the next crisis hits. Of course, there are companies that are voluntarily doing this. It is commendable of these firms to be doing so.Next, there is also news of other countries calling back retired healthcare professionals to serve, to address the kinds of potential manpower shortages that Minister Gan spoke about in February. Is this being explored here?Next, what long-term lessons can we draw in dealing with future pandemics? How does our number of ICU beds per capita compare with other countries? Can we use this crisis to formulate plans to expand ICU beds at short notice at acute care facilities with plans to work with the private sector and retired professionals to augment the supply of equipment and personnel in a time of crisis?And lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir. I would like to return to a theme I spoke about in February – slowing the slope of reserves growth. A letter appeared in The Straits Times Forum on 28 March. Let me read out a part of that letter. The full letter is available online; and I quote \"The reason why robust fiscal measures such as the Resilience Budget are possible is due to financial discipline and prudence and growing Singapore's reserves at a the strong rate all this time. Had we for whatever reasons rested on our laurels and grown our reserves at a slower rate as was suggested before and\" and in brackets, it says \"grow reserves at a slower rate to invest in Singaporeans, Leon Perera, 28 February\". \"The Resilience Budget would not be possible and we would now be in economic dire straits due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"I sent a reply to this letter on the same day, which The Straits Times Forum has not published to the best of my knowledge. Please allow me to read out a part of that reply.\"In 2008, the Government introduced the Net Investment Returns Framework where half of the long-term expected real returns on relevant reserves asset classes can be used for Budget spending. In 2015, Temasek was added to this framework. Both of these changes effectively slowed down the reserves growth rate, but surely few of us today would argue that these changes were irresponsible because they slowed reserves growth. The funds released have been put to constructive use in the Budget. Our reserves have been estimated at over a trillion dollars. The best policies to govern reserves growth versus releasing more Budget funds should thus be different today from what they were in the past. To use an analogy from thebusiness world, a start-up company may need to conserve cash to manage cash flow. But when it has grown to the point where there is tens of billions in cash, corporate leaders should think about how the cash should be invested for better long-term growth and to benefit stakeholders rather than growing the cash pile at the same rate as when the company was at the start-up stage.In fact, the Government introducing the current resource framework in 2008, and adding Temasek in 2015, implicitly recognised this point. There can be over saving just as there can be under saving. Moreover, releasing more Budget funds can mean investing more in our people and our companies in ways that if successful would enhance the long-term potential growth rate of GDP, productivity and innovation. If this happens, tax revenue would rise in tandem with GDP thus reducing the need to draw on the reserves and reserves returns.Singaporeans should have fact-based rational conversations on the right rate of reserves growth versus releasing more Budget funds. Such conversations need to address deep strategic and philosophic questions, like what the additional funds could be invested to do, balanced against what possible future emergencies could necessitate drawing down a massive percentage of those reserves. It is time to recognise that there can be reasonable viewpoints on both sides of this question.And in relation to the letter writer's last point, what we will have as a nation to weather the storm the next time a crisis hits, is not only our reserves but more importantly, the solidarity, the resolve and the ingenuity of our people.\"And this is where I end the quote from that reply and I believe Assoc Prof Theseira actually made a similar point on the last point that I just mentioned. I am sharing this now because to me such debate and disagreement is really how we get to real unity and real consensus formation.Let us look at the question of wearing masks out of doors. It now seems that the minority of naysayers who had called for that from an early stage onwards at a valid point – like the four doctors who signed an open letter to that effect in February. In noting this, I do not blame anyone. There is no playbook for a crisis like this. Many of us were wrong-footed on this question including the World Health Organization, but that points to the continuing value of openness, transparency, debate and accountability even in times of crisis. Let us debate big questions openly, rationally, sensibly, on the basis of transparency to define an agreed set of relevant facts.Let us accept that there can be different goals and strategies that are consistent with the same facts, not labelling those with different views about those goals and strategies. And if we can get to that we would be one United people who have built a democratic society and one built to last.11.58 amMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): Sir, I thank the Government for providing a Resilience and Solidarity Budget that provides increased assistance to many Singaporeans in this time of great need.Many residents have shared how appreciative they are and thanked the Government for this. Sir, I have four points to raise in relation to the Budget.My first point is about those on unpaid leave and reduced working hours. The Resilience and Solidarity Budget provides much support to Singaporeans who have lost their jobs and for the self-employed. But we need to do more for those who remain in employment but have nonetheless taken a big hit in their incomes. Such workers can either be workers forced to take pay cuts or go on unpaid leave, or hourly workers who have lost shifts and hours.I recently received an email from my resident, whose employer cut her hours from full-time to part-time. Overnight she lost 50% of her income. Another resident has been put on unpaid leave for at least three months. Overnight she lost 100% of her income. These are not isolated cases and I am sure all Members in this House have received similar calls for help. The only new scheme applicable to this group of workers in this Budget is the Temporary Relief Fund. But it only provides one-off cash grant of $500.Can the Government provide more financial support for those who have lost income but remain in employment?For a start, we can expand the COVID-19 Support Grant to supplement the monthly income of these workers up to a cap of $800 and up to three months or when they are back to full employment. This is especially important for those put on unpaid leave. After all, those on unpaid leave essentially become unemployed for the months they are on unpaid leave. The reply might be that we are helping employers retain workers through the Jobs Support Scheme but to save at least 25% of salarycosts, there might still be employers who will prefer to put workers on unpaid leave.Sir, it is not likely that the damage to our economy will be over any time soon. We should provide some level of wage stability for those lucky enough to find themselves still employed but with zero or significantly reduced income.My second point is about childcare leave. Parents working in essential services and key economic sectors perform a duty for our nation as they continue going into their workplaces in this time of global pandemic. However, there is a big, unanswered question of what happens when the children of these parents are required to stay at home due to COVID-related health symptoms, school closures, Leaves of Absences or Stay-Home Notices.These parents do not have the option to work from home, yet they may have a young child at home during working hours. Some will be lucky enough to have alternative care-giving and caring employers. But what about those who do not?We should remember that the legal entitlement of childcare leave is already insufficient during a regular year. As I mentioned in my speech on the Budget debate, parents exhaust it during mandatory pre-school closures and during their children's sickness. Now, in this most irregular year, school closures and stay-home requirements last for weeks. How can they possibly have enough childcare leave to take? The only option left for them is unpaid leave. Many parents have told me this is indeed what they are taking, but in this business climate, they worry they will lose their jobs if they take too much unpaid leave.To help such parents, I hope we can introduce a Government-paid childcare leave for parents who are working in essential services or key economic sectors and whose children are affected by COVID-related stay-home requirements. There are currently no protections for them, and we need to bear in mind that many have no alternatives and do not have the money to hire additional help. They desperately need this COVID-related childcare leave so they can keep their jobs and be there for their children.Sir, we cannot leave it to employers and employees to work out amicable arrangements to balance the business needs with employees' childcare needs in this difficult time. In this difficult time, the Government has to step in.My third point is a short and simple one. As part of our Care and Support Package, we are giving $300 in cash to every adult Singaporean who has a Singaporean child aged 20 years old and below. Many single unwed parents have written to me asking if they qualify for this. Can the Government confirm that single unwed parents qualify? I think we can all agree that these dark days are not a time for discrimination, and all parents deserve the care and support regardless of their marital status.Single unwed parents are in an especially tight spot. Their households are single-income. They do not have an additional pair of helping hands. Also, because the median income of single unwed mothers under 35 years old was already $600, they will lack job security and are likely to face losses in wages. They need this cash assistance. They, and many other Singaporeans, will also benefit from all the other measures I mentioned before: more financial support for those on unpaid leave and reduced working hours, increased telecommuting and a COVID-related childcare leave.My final point is about our migrant friends, workers who have left their homes to come and build and clean ours. News has emerged that two migrant worker dormitories, S11 @ Punggol and Westlite in Toh Guan have been gazetted as isolation areas. Many Singaporeans have contacted me to share their concerns for the safety and well-being of these workers.I must first thank Minister Josephine Teo for her comprehensive Facebook post on the measures taken to prevent transmissions and to ensure that the basic needs of migrant workers are met including food, necessities, salary and medical care. Migrant worker dormitories are very densely packed and the workers live in very close proximity. I understand that measures have been taken to implement safe distancing measures and to thin out the dormitories.However, even with these measures, the risk of transmission is very high. The issue is the conditions the workers live in.Last night, I received photos from migrant workers living in one of these dorms and the conditions are still far from optimal. We have to do more, much more to improve the current living conditions. This is vital to stop the outbreak in these dormitories. Beyond the measure we are taking now, I also sincerely hope MOM will do a complete review and ensure that our migrant workers' living conditions are improved significantly. I am glad Minister Josephine agrees with this and has given her word that action will be taken.Next, many workers are also afraid that they have been infected with COVID-19. To supplement the measures already taken, can we consider proactively testing the workers in dormitories with infected workers, starting with those who lived in closer proximity to the infected workers? This would assist in definitively identifying those infected and quickly isolating them to prevent a further outbreak. I understand there are limitations for doing this nationwide. Can we do more extensive testing on a limited scale for this high-risk population? This would help to keep Singaporeans safe too and help calm the workers who are extremely worried.Lastly, as with Singaporeans, the workers are also worried about their livelihoods. Minister Josephine has said that MOM will work with employers to ensure that quarantined workers continue to be paid and that their period of absence from work is treated as paid hospitalisation leave, as part of the workers' statutory leave eligibility. This has provided a lot of assurance to the workers and they are very thankful. I hope MOM will follow up and ensure that every worker is paid.Deputy Prime Minister Heng also announced yesterday that we will waive the monthly Foreign Worker Levy due in April and also provide employers with a Foreign Worker Levy Rebate of $750 for each work permit or S Pass holder. This will help employers pay and take care of the upkeep of their workers, and prepare their workforce to restart when the circuit breaker is lifted. Can I ask whether we will be ensuring that these rebates are passed down to the workers and how will we ensure that the workers are paid their salaries and not put on unpaid leave?Sir, I stand in support of this Budgets. My speech was actually much longer, but a lot of the points I was going to raise were addressed by the Government in the announcements made last week and yesterday. I thank all the Ministries and Statutory Boards and all of our frontline and essential workers for working so hard to keep all of us safe. I thank them for responding so quickly to concerns raised by the public and introducing measures that will make a huge difference in the lives of fellow Singaporeans and workers in Singapore.As we march forward with this Supplementary Budget that targets aid at specific groups, we must make sure that no one slip through the cracks. Let us make sure that everyone make it through this crisis together. Together, we will beat this virus.Mr Speaker: Senior Parliamentary Secretary Low Yen Ling.12.08 pmThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling): Mr Speaker, Sir, Minister Teo has spoken about protecting livelihoods and helping businesses stay viable. Indeed, we will do all we can to preserve jobs and businesses, and support our workforce. Let me now share more about how we are helping companies adopt more flexible work arrangements (FWAs) that let them continue operations amid the uncertainty or to resume their businesses after this circuit breaker period.Last Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced stringent measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. From today, all workplaces, with the exception of those in essential services or key economic sectors, are closed. This is to minimise physical interactions and break the circuit of virus transmission. Despite the closure, firms that can continue operations with their workers on telecommuting arrangements, should continue to do so.We understand that companies that had implemented FWAs and telecommuting prior to the enhanced measures, in fact, prior to the COVID-19 crisis, for their staff were better able to operationalise business continuity plans (BCP) quickly.Singtel is an example. Half of Singtel's 12,000 employees are already been working from home prior to today. The majority of them are used to working offsite and they have the infrastructure to do so. Those who need to be at their workplaces work on staggered work times and also staggered lunch periods. Some employees start work as early as 7.00 am because that suits them and some as late as 10.00 am. Of course, those working at 7.00 am, they get to go back home earlier. The company's operations continue to run as seamlessly as possible and customers are well-supported.Another example is legal services firm Allen & Gledhill. Their lawyers and staff work from home with the support of a robust and secure IT infrastructure that allows them to meet and collaborate remotely. Ms Jessica Tan, in her many speeches advocated that, it is possible to meet and collaborate with colleagues even as we telecommute or work from home.Chairman and Senior Partner of Allen & Gledhill said this, Ms Christina Ong said, and I quote: \"Our focus on embracing technology has meant that when we had to, we could. For certain types of work, some of our lawyers now even say that they accomplish even more from home. Furthermore, working from home has allowed parents to deal with school issues and gives many of us leeway in handling other disruptions.\"Today, companies can already benefit from MOM's Work-Life Grant (WLG) and receive $2,000 for every worker who adopts an FWA. As we move into a period of stricter social distancing, we will make it easier for employers to get support in implementing telecommuting and staggered hours. MOM will enhance the WLG parameters by reducing the requirement for firms to have their workers telecommute and be on staggered hours – from a minimum period of six months to just one month. The enhanced WLG parameters will apply after the mandatory circuit breaker period comes to an end and the grant will be open for application on 20 April 2020.We strongly encourage more companies to apply for the WLG which can be used for the purchase of laptops, software and related equipment for telecommuting. In the immediate term, adopting FWAs will help companies overcome the present challenges posed by COVID-19.In the long run, FWAs will help companies ride the wave of changing workplace norms, become a more inclusive, caring, and also attractive employer and thereby attracting better talent. FWAs have helped companies like Cycle and Carriage become a choice employer, as their staff appreciate the extra time they have with their family, the ability to attend to personal matters and greater flexibility in childcare arrangements. Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me to say a few words in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Mr Speaker, Sir, our enterprises are currently already benefiting from MOM's Work-Life Grant. Employers are able to receive $2,000 for every worker on a flexible work arrangement. Because of the effects of COVID-19, especially during this circuit breaker period, we want to observe safe distancing, so, we need people to work at home or we have staggered working hours. Therefore, in order to help our employers to provide such flexible working arrangements so that more people will be able to work from home, MOM will make it easier for employers to benefit from this grant.At the moment, enterprises have to certify that they have been having this arrangement for six months before they can apply. Now, we have shortened this period to one month. In other words, the application criteria have been shortened from six months to one month. So, these relaxed arrangements will apply after the circuit breaker period. We will open for application from 20 April 2020 and we encourage companies to apply for the Work-Life Grant which provides flexibility for example, using devices such as portable computers and so on. In the short run , the Work-Life Grant can help companies overcome the challenges brought by COVID-19.In the long run, successfully implementing flexible work arrangements will not only help our companies to keep on improving productivity, it would actually help them become more inclusive workplaces so as to attract and retain more talented people, hence, it serves many purposes.(In English):Companies that are positioning themselves for the upturn should plan ahead to ensure that they equip their workers with relevant skillsets after the temporary closure of workplace comes to an end. Firms can tap on the enhanced support for redeployment programmes under the Adapt and Grow initiative to reskill their existing workers.MOM has extended the funding period and introduced new redeployment programmes for the tourism, aviation, retail and food services sectors. More than 100 firms have already applied, with more than 2,600 workers expected to benefit from this move.For instance, SITA World Travel (SITA) equipped their staff through various courses with skills like data analytics and event management. Two employees are on the new Digital Marketing Place-and-Train Programme and they will be redeployed to support SITA’s online platform with their newly acquired skills.Another example is Orchard Hotel. This hotel is also tapping on MOM’s enhanced measures to retrain close to 50 of their employees through the Job Redesign Place-and-Train programme for the hotel industry. Their 50 staff will acquire deeper capabilities in hotel operations, with the aim of taking on an expanded job scope.We wish to commend SITA and Orchard Hotel. Despite thecost pressures, both companies decided to take a longer term perspective by holding onto their workers and helping the workers acquire new skills. Employers who look after their staff are well placed to gain from their workers’ loyalty in the long run, especially when the upturn comes.Mr Speaker, Sir, there will be no let-up in MOM's push to preserve jobs and support our workforce. We are in this together. We call upon employers to help, to support and to care for their employees in this critical time. We also call upon our employees to also do their part by understanding their employer’s situation. None of us is alone in this COVID-19 fight.MOM will continue to do our best to support employers and employees throughout this challenging period. Despite the unprecedented situation we face, we are confident that we can ride out the storm together.In just seven weeks, we saw and we heard from Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, he delivered three Budgets– the Unity Budget, the Resilience Budget and yesterday the Solidarity Budget. So, let us stayunited, let us show our resilience and also stand in solidarity with one another because we Singaporeans, we are a tough lot. We will not give up and we will prevail in this COVID-19 fight.Mr Speaker: Mr Christopher de Souza.12.18 pmMr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah): Sir, extraordinary times require extraordinary people. I believe, for I choose to believe, that Singapore and Singaporeans have the gumption and mettle to ride this storm.\tIt will be a herculean effort, but we can – indeed, we must – do it.To\tdo\tso,\twe\tneed\tto\tface\treality\tsquarely\tand\tthen chart our course to brighter days.As\tpeople play their part by staying at home, businesses suffer due to drop in demand. Employees are being laid off. Flights have almost come to a grinding halt as countries close their borders to contain and stabilise the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Supply chains in certain sectors have been broken. With half of the world’s population mandated to stay at home as of Friday, 3 April, the world’s economy is almost at a standstill even as our medical forces show formidable courage, strength and resilience. Besides implementing measures to “flatten the curve” and “break the circuit”, we must bolster our health force’s fight against the virus and should provide support for researchers and clinicians to find medical solutions to the COVID-19 crisis.The Resilience Budget requires a significant decision on the part of Parliament as it draws on our reserves. It deserves a robust debate. Such a debate is not just for the sake of those who contributed to our reserves, nor is it just for the sake of those whose sacrifices allowed us to have and preserve those reserves, but it is also for the sake of our younger generation and future generations yet to be born. We must ensure for their sake that every dollar we spend from the reserves is a dollar deservedly spent.In\tthat vein, I want to dive into four areas: one, aviation; two, tourism; three, rentals; four, supply chains. In particular, whether we are stretching every dollar in the Resilience Budget and the Solidarity Budget, so as to achieve optimum help in these areas.The aviation sector is one of the industries in Singapore most affected by the COVID-19 crisis. It was one of the first to be impacted as travel restrictions were introduced by several countries early on to prevent cases from being imported. The impact was so severe that on 17 March this year, the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation estimated that most of the world’s airlines will be bankrupt by end-May this year.As a travel hub, Singapore’s aviation industry is a key component, with our national carrier, Singapore Airlines, flying our\tSingapore flag high.\tFor Singapore\tto continue to be\ta\tchoice location\tfor regional headquarters, regional and international connectivity is crucial. We need to keep our aviation industry alive, so that\twe\thave a\tstrong,\tsupportive\tand\tconnected eco-system for businesses to thrive in.Therefore, I welcome the much needed support the Resilience Budget is giving to the aviation sector.Besides supporting workers through the additional job support scheme to offset 75% of the first $4,600 of a local employee’s wages, the aviation sector is receiving $350 million enhanced aviation support. Extending that lifeline is crucial and far-sighted.But while these wages are being subsidised, the reality is our aircraft are grounded. Therefore, one way in order to make the wage subsidy even more productive is to have the crew redeployed to sectors facing manpower shortages, for example, in the healthcare industry, or in companies needing to distribute medical devices such as respirators and ventilators. Quite possibly, this will be of relevance to the crew when eventually they fly again – having crew trained in emergency health skills is relevant to passenger aircraft. This makes SIA and its affiliated fleets more attractive when eventually they fly again.The next sector that has been deeply affected by the COVID-19 crisis is the tourism industry. In 2019,\tthere were 19.1 million international visitor arrivals\tin Singapore who spent an estimated $27.1 billion.The tourism industry is not just a sector that is important in its own right but it supports many other sectors of our economy as well. Tourists contribute to retail, food and beverage, events and conventions, and it\teven helps attract investors as well as companies who want to set up their businesses in a place with a worldwide audience. Tourism also helps build connections for potential trade partners in the future and boosts Singapore’s standing on the international stage. As such, supporting the tourism industry which has been greatly affected by this unexpected crisis is important; and therefore I welcome the enhanced support for the tourism industry in the Resilience Budget.However, we should try to go further – so that the money is made more productive, we should require tourism hotspots to consider seriously how they can make their attractions more safe, from a hygiene point of view, as well as improve user friendliness for their visitors. This will help ensure Singapore will be one of the first destinations tourists would want to return to in the aftermath of the pandemic.The third area I want to talk about is the rental of commercial properties. Commercial tenants have been deeply affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Even before the closure of non-essential businesses, these tenants in malls have suffered from lower footfall as people were encouraged to stay at home. Safe distancing was understandably implemented to prevent overcrowding in malls and minimise the spread of the virus. This has had a huge impact on retail and F&B business. In the Unity Budget, qualifying commercial properties were given 15% property tax rebate, with the landlords urged to pass this on to their tenants.In\tthe Resilience Budget, the quantum and scope was broadened.I have been told that some of these tenants that some of these tenants are unable to secure a $100 in revenue a day, a sum too little to cover rental for a day.In some places, landlords have not been prompt to pass on the rebate saving to their tenants, adopting a wait-and-see approach.In my speech on the Unity Budget I had suggested\tthat we make the landlords of commercial spaces\tmore accountable, and suggested that they be required to fill up a declaration to IRAS as to whether they had passed on the property rebates to the tenant and if so, how much in dollar terms.Indeed,\tthe bludgeoning few weeks since I gave that speech have caused me to form the view that we should go even further. Beyond my suggested declaration, we should make it compulsory for the commercial landlord to pass on the full property tax rebate, in actual dollar terms, to the tenants. Hence, I am glad that we are soon passing legislation to that effect. Such prescriptive legislation ensures the money spent from our Budget is indeed stretched.The fourth area that I want to speak about is supply chains. In our globally connected economy, supply chains are\tinterwoven across countries and, with cities and countries under lockdown, global supply chains have been affected.\tThe knock-on effect reverberates across economies. Many businesses especially with smaller margins\tmay not have enough liquidity and cash to survive through months of low revenue due to the crisis.One of the ways the Resilience Budget supports businesses is by helping them get the financing that they need, for example, through the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme. Indeed,\tthe\tSolidarity\tBudget\tseeks\tto\tincrease\tthe Government’s risk share from 80% to 90%. Such risk-sharing initiatives are commendable, for they incentivise the injection of liquidity in the market.Nonetheless, as these\tloans are\tadministered by individual financial institutions and banks, the process for\tsourcing\tand\tthe\texercise\tof\tcomparing\trates\tand fees across banks can be complicated and time-consuming especially for those who are unfamiliar with business loans.May I suggest we streamline the process through a one-stop online portal that allows businesses to\tfind\tout eligibility, compare\tthe fees\tand rates of the different banks’ loans under the schemes, and apply using a standardised form? This will shorten the time needed to source for a loan, obtain the loan and the time needed to receive the much-needed monies from the loan.It is crucial to shorten and simplify the process as much as possible during this COVID-19 crisis because some businesses may not have the weeks needed to wait for the monies to be credited into their accounts. Such expediency will help the risk-sharing initiative better achieve its aim – that of swift injection of liquidity and the prompt availability of credit.Sir, in 1985, Singapore was going through a major post-Independence recession. As Singapore was still in the midst of the recession described as \"a watershed in our economic development”, President Mr Wee Kim Wee in his Address to Parliament said, I quote, “When the recession eventually ends, as it must, we would have made another great stride towards realising our vision of a nation of excellence.”What we are facing today is different from the past in terms of extent, magnitude and nature, but all Singaporeans must have to count on each other. Indeed, many Singaporeans are counting on us in this House to express clear, methodical, honest, rational thinking as we shape and pass policy into law. We must deliver that for Singaporeans we were elected to serve. All these facets make up the essence of solidarity. The names of the Budgets are such an accurate description of what we want to instill – unity, resilience, solidarity.Sir, in the course of preparing this speech, I have been inspired\tby the unity, resilience and solidarity of Singaporeans. Just last Friday, four days ago, Mabel, a constituent in Ulu Pandan spoke with me at Meet-People-Session (MPS). Mabel is caring for a young special needs child in her family. She is also helping her adult daughter recover from a hospital stay, and on top of that she is caring for her own mother who is aged. Yet, Mabel continues to want to get re-employed notwithstanding the present situation. Such resilience is inspiring.Three days ago on Saturday, I met Adeline, a young adult in the Ghim Moh Hawker Centre. She shared with me that she wants to help as a volunteer to deliver food for the elderly in the constituency. Spontaneous and driven by unity.And\tjust yesterday, I received a message from a constituent named Darren, who emailed me saying that his family wants to donate $30,000 to a worthy cause in the constituency to help the more vulnerable residents tide over this period.I was taken aback at these gestures. In just the last five days, I have met different Singaporeans in completely\tunochestrated settings who have reflected and\texpressed the magnanimous traits of Solidarity, Unity and Resilience.Will there be some friction along the way? Some kinks in the roll-out? Sure! That would be completely understandable. But as long as we gravitate towards a national ethos of unity, resilience and solidarity, and have the physical fire power to deploy further financial measures, if needed, then we would have earned Singapore a steady ballast to weather this storm.Sir, I should state clearly that I support the Resilience\tand Solidarity Budgets. However, Sir, spending our country’s reserves cannot, and must not, be taken lightly. We owe it to the generations who built up these reserves and the generations not yet born to ensure that every dollar should be stretched to maximise its benefit to the industry and the worker it seeks to help. Integrity and the ethos of stewardship in that spending process will achieve for us the objectives of unity, resilience and solidarity.Sir, fighting our way through this crisis will be a herculean task. But I choose to believe that we, as a people, have the\tmettle to accomplish such a task, and that the camaraderie\tthat it will entrench will define Singapore’s character – as a nation full of fight, determination and grit. And that is a future worthy of our struggle.The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad): Mr Speaker, Minister for Manpower used the word \"surreal\" as she described this Chamber. Seeing us all spaced out, a reflection of the times that we are facing – to overcome a crisis that will define this generation, our generation.Having spent the last few weeks engaging employers, workers and ordinary citizens, we can see the anxiety shows. For those whom I have met whose livelihoods have been affected, I thank them for their calm and their willingness to work with us to get through this crisis.Many hope for the best, some plan for the worst. With three Budgets in the space of two months – the Unity, the Resilience and the Solidarity Budgets – the leadership, care and concern of this Government shows as it prepares Singapore for the best, the worst and everything else that comes in between.For the Ministry of Manpower, our priorities are clear – to Save Jobs, to Protect Our Workers and to Support Their Livelihoods. In these difficult times, we are especially concerned for those who are more vulnerable – our low-wage workers, the self-employed persons (SEPs) and our foreign workers.I will first address our efforts for self-employed persons. Many SEPs have seen their livelihoods badly affected amidst this COVID-19 situation. To help Singaporean SEPs with less means and family support tide through this period of extraordinary economic uncertainty, we introduced the SEP Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) as part of the Resilience Budget and enhanced it in the Solidarity Budget.All eligible Singaporean SEPs will receive direct cash assistance through three quarterly cash payouts of $3,000 each or $9,000 in total. SIRS will provide cash assistance to SEPs most in need quickly. We want the cash assistance to reach our SEPs fast. So, we used the Workfare criteria as a starting point, and further expanded the criteria to cover almost double the number of SEPs as Workfare. Hence, there is no need for most eligible SEPs to apply. Eligible SEPs aged 37 and above who declared a positive net trade income to IRAS or CPFB for 2018 will be automatically notified via letter and SMS in end May 2020. They will receive the first payout automatically in end May, followed by July and October this year.We know that some SEPs who do not qualify automatically are worried. They hope to be considered. For example, SEPs who are aged 21 to 36 in 2020, but otherwise meet the criteria; and SEPs whose spouses earn a high income but have many people at home to support. My colleagues and I will try our best to consider the applications of those who did not qualify automatically, particularly those aged 21 to 36 in 2020 but otherwise meet the criteria. We will also seriously consider the appeals of those who narrowly missed the eligibility criteria.I am also glad that NTUC Secretary-General has offered to front the application and appeals of SIRS. MOM will work with NTUC to provide details on how to apply, and how those who do not meet the SIRS criteria can appeal very soon. We seek your patience and understanding.During this downturn, we want SEPs who have spare capacity to train and upskill themselves for the coming upturn. To support them, we announced a new SEP Training Support Scheme (STSS) duringCOSlast month. SEPs who take up any SkillsFuture Series courses and other selected training programmes can receive an hourly training allowance of $7.50 that will help defray their daily expenses. This was for a period of three months, and is on top of the substantial course fees subsidies of up to 90%.The Government has now extended the STSS till the end of the year. We will also increase the hourly training allowance from $7.50 to $10, with effect from 1 May 2020. There is no cap to how much training SEPs can sign up for. For example, a self-employed private hire car or bus driver who spends 10 full days of training in a month can receive $800 of training allowance that month.The STSS is administered by NTUC’s e2i. Applications have already started since 1 April 2020. SEPs can refer to NTUC’s website for more details. We encourage all SEPs to tap on this training support.Mr Speaker, during these difficult times, it is also important for us to pay special attention to another vulnerable group – our low-wage workers. Many, such as our cleaners and security officers, are critical to the provision of essential services during this COVID-19 pandemic.At Budget 2020, we announced that low-wage workers on Workfare will receive a Workfare Special Payment (WSP). They would receive an additional 20% of their Workfare payout for work done in 2019, with a minimum payment of $100. This was to be paid in November.We will enhance WSP to step up support for our low-wage workers, including SEPs, earning up to $2,000 per month in 2019. They will receive an enhanced WSP of $3,000 each, fully in cash. CPF Board will pay eligible Workfare recipients two payouts of $1,500 earlier, in July and October this year. There is no need to apply. Eligible recipients will be notified and paid automatically by the CPF Board.Lower wage workers will continue to receive additional support through the enhanced Workfare Income Supplement (WIS). The\tqualifying\tincome\tceiling\tand\tmaximum\tannual payouts have both gone up since January 2020. More workers can benefit from greater Workfare support of up to $4,000 a year.In his speech yesterday, Member Pritam Singh spoke about adopting \"living wage\". In times like these, no \"minimum wage\" or \"living wage\" system can help low-wage workers. When there is no work, there is no salary, there is no minimum wage to talk about when firms are unable to pay for their low-wage workers.So, Workfare is the reason why the Government can calibrate the 20% additional wage top-up and the $3,000 special payment, or any other wage support needed for later, for our low-wage workers who are vulnerable and who need our support. This, on top of Jobs Support Scheme that we are providing to companies. So, we complement the approach with the Progressive Wage Model for our cleaners, our security officers and landscape workers. Unlike minimum wage or living wage, we take a multi-layered approach to support our low-wage workers, and which is effective especially in these times of need.As the impact on our economy deepens, more firms may close. The Short-Term Relief Fund today provides financial help to low-wage workers whose employers are unable to pay them wages due to financial difficulties or business failure. Since 1 April this year, we have increased the support from the fund, from up to one month’s salary, capped at $1,000 today, to up to two months’ salary, capped at $4,600, depending on the worker’s income. To help more workers, we have extended the coverage of the fund beyond the low-wage workers to cover half of the workforce.While we look out for our local workers, it is just as important that we take good care of our foreign workers. Some Members highlighted the media coverage that conditions in the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol were poor. MOM last inspected the dormitory on 4 March 2020 and found that the dormitory was clean and the conditions were found to be satisfactory.As Members would all know now, as a result of the evolving COVID-19 situation, the Ministry of Health gazetted the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan Dormitory as isolation areas two days ago.We acknowledge the challenges at the start to prepare the living areas for isolation while quarantine was going on. Mr Speaker, these are not normal times, and while not ideal, the dorm conditions, admittedly, could have been upkept better during this transition. We appreciate the workers’ patience and cooperation, and will continue to improve the conditions for the residents of the dormitories. I would like to assure Singaporeans that MOM is coordinating efforts to ensure that the needs and well-being of our foreign workers residing at both dormitories are well taken care of.Workers that had close contact with the confirmed cases have already been separately quarantined. MOH has also set up medical posts on-site to assess and treat workers who are unwell. They will be relocated and housed separately from their usual room-mates.This is an unprecedented incident that the Government is managing, and MOM officers and our partner NGO, the Migrant Workers' Centre, have been working round-the-clock with the dormitory operators and our partners to prioritise the well-being of workers who remain healthy. This includes ensuring the timely supply of food and stepping up hygiene management, as a result of extended hours of stay by the workers in the dormitories.Minister Iswaran, Member of Parliament Murali and I visited Westlite Papan dormitory last weekend to assure our foreign workers that these heightened measures of safe distancing are to protect everyone and that we will do our best to work with employers to take care of their welfare.I had also visited Sungei Tengah Lodge dormitory on the same evening as MOH announced that a COVID-19 cluster was found in the dormitory. Understandably, they were anxious to know what arrangements would be made to protect them. Top of their concerns was whether they would continue to get paid. Second, what measures will the dorms put in place to ensure their safety and protection. They too have families at home who depend on their salaries here.With Deputy Prime Minister Heng’s announcement of the foreign worker levy waiver and rebate measures, we can now give our foreign workers greater assurance that their employers should be able to continue to pay for their salaries, provide accommodation and food. I strongly urge employers to pass the Budget support to their workers and help us to keep them cared for and motivated during this period.Our self-employed persons, lower-wage workers and foreign workers play an important role in our economy and in building our nation. In this uncertain period, it is important that we provide them with greater certainty and support. The MOM will help them overcome this difficult period so that we can all emerge stronger after this crisis.Mr Speaker, allow me to share how we will support workers and employers in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Last Friday, the Prime Minister spoke on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore. We had to make the difficult decision to implement additional safe distancing measures for one month to act as a \"circuit breaker”.The temporary closure of most workplaces, except for essential services and key economic sectors, takes effect today. It will impact our workers and businesses.We stand in solidarity with businesses and workers and will get through this together. Our top priority is to protect the livelihoods of our workers. The enhanced Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) will help businesses retain and pay their workers.With the assurance of the enhanced JSS, we urge businesses to communicate clearly to their employees on their work and pay arrangements for the next few weeks.As I shared in my English speech earlier, we will ensure that all vulnerable worker segments, such as self-employed persons (SEPs) and lower-wage workers, receive extensive support to tide through this period.The SEP Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) will provide direct cash assistance to SEPs with less means and lack family support.Eligible Singaporean SEPs will receive quarterly cash payouts of $3,000 each, or $9,000 in total. We expect SIRS to automatically benefit about 100,000 SEPs. SIRS will go to those SEPs most in need and there is no need for most SEPs to apply. We will also support SEPs in their training efforts. The new SEP Training Support Scheme (STSS) provides a training allowance for SEPs who take up SkillsFuture courses and other selected training programmes.This will help defray SEPs' daily expenses. The STSS has been extended till the end of the year, and the hourly training allowance increased from $7.50 to $10 per hour, with effect from 1 May 2020. There is no cap to how much training SEPs can sign up for. So, an SEP like freelancers, taxi drivers or private hire car drivers, who joins a full-time course, which is 8 hours for 10 days for instance, will receive an allowance of $800 per month. The advantage is that the SEP can enhance his skills while getting an allowance, during the downtime in this current economic climate.We will also help our lower wage workers as well. They will receive a Workfare Special Payment of $3,000, fully in cash over two tranches. The Workfare Income Supplement has also been enhanced, with increases in qualifying income ceiling and maximum annual payouts since January 2020.We have also strengthened relief for those whose employers cannot pay their salaries because of financial difficulties or business failure.Together with immediate financial assistance from the Temporary Relief Fund, COVID-19 Support Grant, as well as other support from the enhanced Care and Support Package such as grocery vouchers, service and conservancy charges rebates (S&CC), we will support our SEPs and lower wage workers through this crisis together. There are those amongst us who may have difficulties getting a job in this challenging job market due to the COVID-19 situation.The Government understands their situation and help will be provided for those looking for employment in this difficult job market. The Government will actively facilitate the matching of jobseekers to firms who have immediate vacancies during this period, be it for a new job, or a second job to supplement income.The SGUnited Jobs Initiative will create about 10,000 jobs over the next one year that will come from both the public and private sectors. In these unusual times when safe distancing is key, job fairs would have to take on different forms too – through the use of virtual technology.The first SGUnited Virtual Career Fair is currently ongoing. As at 2 April, there are about 3,900 vacancies available, and more than 5,400 jobseekers have applied for SGUnited Jobs. We have gotten good interest from employers and will keep building up the pool of jobs with jobs that are immediately available.The M3 network is also playing its part. Through two virtual career fairs hosted last March and April, MENDAKI SENSE has already received over 700 job applications and are further facilitating job placements.They also recently launched a dedicated helpline to help those who require assistance in navigating the online portal. MENDAKI SENSE will also help job-seekers find employment through the CariKerja app and will continue to share information on available jobs identified through multiple channels and various initiatives, including those under the SGUnited Jobs initiative.MENDAKI SENSE and other self-help groups are also working with government agencies, such as EDB and ESG to link job-seekers up with companies looking to fill vacancies. Among our jobseekers, we are particularly concerned about our graduating cohorts from ITE, our polytechnics and universities. It is a tough time to enter the job market.The SGUnited Traineeships programme will provide employers with support to offer traineeships instead for fresh graduates. These traineeships will help our ITE, polytechnic and university graduates – they are all first-time jobseekers – to further develop their skills professionally and further boost their employability.To better help our workers, we will need to support companies to overcome the immediate challenges. Apart from very significant support through the JSS, the Government will also help with other businesscosts and ease cash flow.For example, MOM will waive the foreign worker levies in April, and will also provide a one-off rebate of levies paid. SMEs will be given three additional months to make foreign worker levy payments. Lastly, the Government will help businesses with access to credit.Partners such as our trade associations and chambers, also play critical roles in helping our Malay businesses. For example, the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SMCCI) has set up a task force to explore how its members can better leverage on measures from the Unity, Resilience and Solidarity Budgets.They have set up an emergency hotline for members seeking targeted assistance and will organize engagement sessions to gain a better understanding on members’ concerns and to see how best SMCCI can help its members. SMCCI will also support its members in their engagements with stakeholders and landlords.Mr Speaker, in this difficult time, we are helping Singaporeans to stay employed. We will continue to pay particular attention to our SEPs as well as lower wage workers. For those looking for employment, we will help facilitate their efforts in seeking employment. Businesses and workers alike can take this time to adapt – businesses to transform and Singaporeans to further improve our skills.We carry a heavy burden, but we will all bear them together, and emerge stronger from this experience.Mr Speaker: Minister Desmond Lee.12.55 pmThe Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee): Mr Speaker, not long after the SARS crisis, I was posted to the Ministry of Health as a legal officer. One of the things we worked on with colleagues was pandemic preparation. Among other things, we helped prepare and vet agreements for public health stockpiling efforts. And in 2008, we worked with then Minister for Health Khaw Boon Wan on amendments to the Infectious Diseases Act to ensure we had the tools to implement important public health measures to protect people and save lives.One of these measures was safe distancing. It is a very extensive and wide-ranging provision, requiring people to stay home, closing places, restricting movement, prohibiting events and gatherings, to stem the transmission of disease.Minister Khaw said in Parliament in 2008 that, \"invoking such a provision has serious implications as it will cause major disruptions to the businesses and the daily lives of Singaporeans. Such a decision will not be taken lightly.\"He also said very clearly to the House that public health measures are not the role of just the Government but really involve every person and the entire community.I remember discussing with my colleagues then, as we were working on the drafts, that if we ever had to implement extensive safe distancing, it would be at a very critical juncture, and that it would only work if everyone understood the gravity of the measure and played his or her part.These are measures we prepare for but wish we would never need to use. But here we are today, drawing on many of these measures as part of a major circuit breaker to keep Singaporeans safe and to save lives. So let us all play our part.Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have seen the severe impact it has had on ordinary people's lives. Public health measures to \"flatten the curve\" are necessary, but they impose a huge toll on people – loss of jobs and livelihoods, uncertainty, social isolation, fear, psychological distress.This is the public health fight of our lifetime and my colleagues at MSF, ECDA, NCSS and in the social sector have stepped up to play our part in this wide-ranging battle. These included tapping on existing schemes such as ComCare and the Courage Fund. But we have also had to quickly roll out new support schemes. The Temporary Relief Fund for April started last Wednesday and the COVID-19 Support Grant will start from May.We are making adjustments along the way in response to feedback as well as operational and situational constraints. We seek your patience and understanding as my colleagues at the frontline are doing the best they can to help Singaporeans and residents in need.I also thank all who have stepped forward to volunteer and donate. In this exceptional time, we are encouraged by your generosity, spirit and support.For example, visiting our Social Service Offices (SSOs) and Community Centres (CCs), I have come across colleagues and volunteers who have been personally hard-hit by this crisis but who continue to soldier on to serve others who need help.I received a message last night from a couple. They are self-employed persons. They described how all their jobs and assignments had been abruptly cancelled and have had no income for some time. But their only ask is, \"Since we will have no work for the foreseeable future, we would like to see how we can take this time to do something meaningful using the skills that we have to connect people, helping them to ease their fear and loneliness. We want to help but don't know how we can go about doing it.\"There are many others who have stepped forward – silent heroes who are making a positive difference during this crisis.Let me give an update on some of the things that we have done and what more we will do on the social sector. The economic impact of COVID-19 is wide-ranging, affecting many beyond the low-income. Ten days ago, the Deputy Prime Minister launched the Resilience Budget. Under this Budget, MSF has put up two new schemes to help lower and middle income households, who have lost their jobs or a significant proportion of their incomes because of the crisis.Last Wednesday, MSF rolled out the Temporary Relief Fund (TRF) for those who need immediate assistance in April. This is a one-off cash disbursement of $500. We have received more than 100,000 applications so far. We are doing our best to process them quickly, accurately, and responsibly. With the latest circuit breaker measures, we anticipate that more will need help. We will also need to implement greater safe distancing measures, at our SSOs and CCs.Yesterday, thanks to our partnership with GovTech, we launched an online application system. Applicants only need to fill up a short form, and attach some form of proof of income or job loss, such as a letter of retrenchment or payslips. Those who have absolutely no documentation, can make a legal declaration on the form. We received 27,000 online applications yesterday. Applicants can also download application forms from the website, fill them at home and drop it off later at any SSO or CC without having to queue.Those who have lost their jobs due to retrenchment or have had their employment contract terminated as a result of this crisis, will be supported by the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG), which has a longer runway. It will provide a grant of $800 per month, for three months, while applicants participate in a job search or retraining programme.Those who had applied for TRF earlier and had given us their consent to be assessed for the COVID-19 Support Grant, do not need to put in a separate application. They do not need to visit the SSO again and the SSO will contact them if they require further information.For self-employed persons, MOM will also be implementing the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) from May.In parallel, we are also adjusting existing schemes and processes to accommodate the dynamic situation. We have simplified our ComCare processes for lower income households who qualify. They can submit supporting documents even via email.Longer ComCare support is also provided for new cases – typically around six months.SSO officers work with grassroots volunteers to provide practical support, for example, to elderly residents who are quarantined and need help to purchase groceries.The Silver Generation Office has arranged for meal deliveries for seniors who live alone and have mobility issues and communicated COVID-19 precautionary measures to help keep them safe.For Singaporeans who are homeless or rough sleeping, our Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers (PEERS) network continues its work. With 28 partner organisations, Government departments, religious and secular organisations and uniform groups, they have been reaching out regularly and stepped up measures during this process.During the crisis, some of our Safe Sound Sleeping Places have gone 24/7 to enable homeless persons and rough sleepers who need help to stay in shelter during the circuit breaker.We have seen an outpouring of support from companies, unions, volunteer groups, grassroots and religious groups. Many have also stepped forward in their personal capacity. The Community Chest has received more than $8 million of donations to The Courage Fund, to support our healthcare and frontline workers, and lower income families affected by COVID-19. We have disbursed grants to a frontline worker who contracted the disease. We have also reached out to family members of the others who passed on due to the virus and will be disbursing the support to some of them by this week.As a community, we also want to enhance our support to our social service agencies. Many have been working hard to help vulnerable persons, but their donations and fund-raising efforts have been significantly diminished, at a time when they really need to find new ways and bring in new technologies to continue to reach out, to assure and to support vulnerable people in these difficult times.So, the National Council for Social Service or NCSS, will be setting up a new fund, The Invictus Fund, which will be built up from private donations. This Fund will channel private donations to Social Service Agencies or SSAs, that deliver critical services to vulnerable groups in our community. The additional support will help our SSAs maintain their operations, make technology investments to better serve their users, and emerge stronger through this period. MSF and NCSS will share more details on this fund soon.In addition to financial support, NCSS is also working closely with our SSAs to help them with business continuity and technology adoption, so that those providing critical services can continue to do so remotely during this time.Under the Solidarity Budget that Deputy Prime Minister announced yesterday, adult Singaporeans will receive $600 of cash support in April. For those who are better off, individuals and families who do not need this cash payment from the Solidarity Budget, and are considering donating them, you can do so to families that you know who are in need or to one of these funds or to donate it to charities through Giving.sg.Mr Speaker, COVID-19 is a test of our resilience on many fronts – economic, social, health and psychological. Younger Singaporeans may not have encountered a crisis of this magnitude, while older Singaporeans are reminded of tough times early on in our history. Our daily routines have been sharply curtailed and many have had their livelihoods threatened. Such stressors and tensions, if prolonged, can have wider repercussions on relationships, marriages, families and communities. Hence, beyond financial and material support, we must shore up our own emotional and psychological well-being and enmesh this sense of community, that we are all in this together.We will set up a National CARE Hotline to offer emotional support to anyone who faces stress, are anxious, or simply need someone to talk to. This hotline will be manned by Government psychologists, counsellors and other trained personnel. But we would like to make a call for more support. If you are a registered professional – a psychologist or counsellor or trained to provide counselling on marital and family issues, please join us.Some SSAs have already come forward, stepped forward to offer their professional resources, to come under this National CARE hotline umbrella, and we are grateful to them for stepping forward. Already this crisis has taught us invaluable lessons – shown us areas that we will continue to work on, long after COVID-19 is over. We will take a hard look at these areas and also position ourselves to seize opportunities when the thunderstorm starts to clear. How we organise ourselves and support one another, use technology to stay connected, stay healthy, keep isolated if needed, but not lonely.I am encouraged by many who have gone beyond the call of duty, and looked beyond their own interests and difficulties to help others: colleagues in our pre-schools and social service agencies, and volunteers who, at short notice, helped us to roll out new schemes on the ground to help large numbers of people.This is our strength as a society and people, and we will get through this together. This test will be our legacy to the generations after us.1.09 pmThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim): Mr Speaker, within a span of three months, we have seen the far-reaching impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Singaporeans are now grappling with the economic impact of the pandemic. Many are facing the grim realities of pay cuts, job losses and business downturn. Amidst these uncertainties, many are worried and naturally will ask – how long will this last, and how will I provide for my family. We hear your worries and concerns.I would like to share some of the efforts by MSF and our partner agencies to help the more vulnerable Singaporeans and residents. I will also highlight specific help measures for the Malay/Muslim community to help them get through these uncertain times. Allow me to continue my speech in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Mr Speaker, the Government is concerned for those who are badly affected by the economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. My Ministry is implementing several assistance schemes. Amongst them is the Temporary Relief Fund (TRF) to help lower and middle income Singaporeans and Permanent Residents, who have lost their jobs or experienced at least a 30% pay cut due to COVID-19. This one-off assistance of $500 will at least provide immediate relief to their families’ daily needs. Within four days of commencing applications on 1 April 2020, more than 100,000 applications were received for the TRF support scheme.Those who lost their jobs as a result of the economic slowdown due to COVID-19, can tap on the COVID-19 Support Grant from 1 May 2020.This grant provides assistance of $800 a month for 3 months. At the same time, recipients will also be given employment assistance or training support, or both, from the WSG or e2i.I am moved and proud to see the community come together to contribute to the Courage Fund to help those affected by COVID-19. The donation amount has now reached more than $8 million. This fund supports healthcare workers and those in the frontline. This fund is also given to lower income households that lost their income because their family member was infected by COVID-19, had to be quarantined, or received the Stay at Home Notice or Leave of Absence. Lower income households can now apply for help from the Courage Fund at the Social Service Offices (SSOs). Details of the various schemes under the Courage Fund can be found at the National Council of Social Services’ (NCSS) website.MSF has also stepped up assistance for the low income group who are directly affected by COVID-19.The Social Service Offices (SSOs) have reached out to more than 6,400 Singaporeans who are quarantined or given the Stay at Home Notice, who may need ComCare, or other kinds of assistance.The SSOs also partner the grassroots to purchase or deliver groceries to those undergoing quarantine or given stay at home notice, but do not have any family, friends or neighbours who can help them.MSF has also simplified the application process for ComCare assistance, for those undergoing quarantine or stay at home notice, who need assistance. For instance, these applicants can submit their supporting documents electronically by email.Aside from measures to help those directly affected by COVID-19, we have also enhanced support for other groups who apply for ComCare financial assistance. Those who are eligible to receive the ComCare Short to Medium-Term Assistance will receive help for a longer period of at least 6 months. This is meant to stabilise the family's financial situation, while their family members look for jobs or retraining opportunities.During these trying times, it is important that we do whatever that is necessary to not only protect ourselves, but also those around us. The community must adapt to new social norms. This includes avoiding crowds and mass gatherings in order to stop the spread of COVID-19.For those who plan to tie the knot in the coming months, we know that you are disappointed and may have to make several adjustments to your plans. Therefore, ROMM will give fee exemptions to couples who wish to change and re-register their solemnisation dates. Affected couples can contact ROMM if they wish to change their solemnisation date due to COVID -19. In March 2020, some 49 couples have received fee exemptions from ROMM.While we work hard to stop the spread of COVID-19, we must ensure that our children's education is not affected. This is important especially to students from lower income families who may now feel more pressure due to their families’ financial problems.Students who were previously ineligible for MENDAKI's Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy (TTFS) or its interest-free Study Loan, can now re-apply, if there are any changes to their family's income due to COVID-19. MENDAKI will also contact students who are receiving 50% or 75% subsidy for them to reapply for a higher subsidy, if there are changes to their families' income.There are also ITE students who had to work part time to support themselves, but lost their jobs due to COVID-19. For such students, MENDAKI will provide financial assistance for three months. They will receive a $10 allowance for each per school day to pay for their transport and mealcosts.This will hopefully ease the pressure on these students so that they can focus their attention towards their studies. Around 2,000 students will receive this support. Apart from ITE students, MENDAKI will also provide this allowance to students from the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) who are mentors to ITE students in MENDAKI's Empowerment Programme.One lesson we learnt from COVID-19 is how we need to take care of one another and stand united. I was heartened to see many Malay/Muslims coming forward to support Singapore’s effort to deal with COVID-19 and help those in need.Malay/Muslim organisations are important pillars of support. I was pleased that AMP has announced its Temporary Assistance Package 2.0 or TAP 2.0 thatcosts $100,000 to help workers whose family income was affected by COVID-19.Another Malay/Muslim organisation that has come forward to help is the Singapore Muslim Women’s Association (PPIS) who will establish the PPIS WIN Fund for women in need and those who left their jobs to care for their aged parents or their children, during this COVID-19 situation.The Rahmatan Lil Alamin Fund too has also worked with the mosques to raise more that $150,000 for the Courage Fund, which I mentioned earlier.Despite the many challenges that COVID-19 crisis has inflicted on our country, it has also shown our people’s caring side, and when we are united, no Singaporean will be left behind.Mr Speaker, COVID-19 tests the resilience of a society. It affects our source of income, our daily lives, the way we practice our religion and how we socialise with one another. However, it will not rob us of our fighting spirit. Each individual plays an important part in the fight against COVID-19. No effort is too small. In fact simple things like taking care of our personal hygiene and having social responsibility are defences to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Let us ignite this fighting spirit, help those who are affected and stand as one in the battle against COVID-19. Remember, divided we fall, united we stand.1.24 pmMr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member): Mr Speaker, in my speech in the Budget 2020 debate on 27 February 2020, I concluded by saying \"a hallmark of Singapore's Budgets is that in good times, we are prudent and sensible. In tough times, we demonstrate our mettle and sensitivity.\" The Unity, Resilience and Solidarity Budgets are apt testimonials of that truth.The past few weeks have been a time of deep reflection for me. As one of the relatively younger members of this House, I was in my early teens during the SARS outbreak. When H1N1 came to the fore, I was serving my National Service. Despite the anxiety, life did not grind to a halt in those days. We did not have aeroplanes parked on runways, lives disrupted and humanity coming to a standstill as we are seeing today around the world.I believe I speak for my generation when I say that COVID-19 has been a sobering experience and a reality check. The fragile nature of life has been made manifest once again. Seismic shifts labelled mildly as \"new norms\", are being charted. I believe it is not going to be \"business as usual\" when \"normal service resumes\". Frankly, it can no longer be business as usual and this shall form the crux of what I am about to say.Mr Speaker, my speech will revolve around three themes: gratitude, fear and hope. Allow me to begin by highlighting three groups of people who, I believe, deserve our nation's gratitude.First, like all Members in this House, I express my deepest appreciation to our front-line workers. These are our doctors and nurses who work tirelessly round the clock to treat our people. These are our civil servants, policemen and soldiers who do contact tracing, manning our borders and to ensure the smooth delivery of services in these trying times. These are our overworked and unsung heroes.Next, I ask this House to remember the foreign workers in Singapore. During this difficult time, these heroes have chosen to be away from their families in order to fulfil our critical manpower needs. When Malaysia instituted the MCO, they came on such short notice that they had barely had time to pack and say goodbye to their loved ones. This group of workers are often invisible. Three weeks ago, I met a lady who shared with me that she was working as a cleaner in Singapore and she left her four-month-old infant with her sister to come to Singapore overnight and to be here. And they are our cleaners and construction workers, delivery riders, security guards and people who provide essential services. Without them, our city would quite literally grind to a halt.Lastly, I extend my appreciation to the citizens who have stepped up to assist in times of crisis – from the individuals who help to ensure that our workers have shelter to our drivers who are committed to transport our healthcare staff to and from their workplace. Sir, these individuals have come together in this national effort to contribute what little they have.Indeed, one encouraging trend is individuals mobilising to express their appreciation for the people around them. Just yesterday, I am aware that the students in SMU Law School as well as other student groups sent care packages to our frontliners.Our nation has set the “gold standard” not only in how we have dealt with this crisis, but also in how we have treated our people. This effort is only possible because of the dedicated service, immense sacrifice and the resolute single-mindedness of our people. Sir, we salute them all.Next, I would like to focus on my second theme of fear, which I sense is an undercurrent permeating our society. In these tumultuous times, our fellow Singaporeans are going through tremendous stress. Let me raise three concerns in particular.First, our workers are understandably concerned about their livelihood. With the partial lockdown or circuit breaker measures in place, the drastic reduction in demand worldwide, many businesses will have little to no revenue in the coming months. While this Budget promises a maximum of over $3,000 per worker in wage subsidies, my question is simply how do we ensure that these subsidies are passed along to the workers? Does the Government intend to credit subsidies directly to our workers? Will we be passing a Bill mandating that employers pass these subsidies along? This is a key concern.Next, I will speak about the fears expressed by our VWOs and their beneficiaries. Our VWOs are an important component of our social safety net. They ensure that our fellow Singaporeans who have fallen on hard times are clothed, fed and generally able to begin rebuilding their lives. Other VWOs make it a point to befriend our elderly, bring them for their medical appointments and generally care for their needs.Sir, one thing which all our VWOs have in common is their reliance on donations and volunteers. With the current economic downturn, many have expressed their worry at not being able to continue servicing their beneficiaries. I wish to ask this House how do we intend to ensure that this crucial component of our social safety net does not disappear simply because of this pandemic. While this sickness will eventually pass, I worry that a massive loss of capacity in this sector would leave us with yet another crisis on our hands. Could we also explore – in addition to the Invictus Fund that Minister Desmond Lee announced earlier – increasing the 250% tax deduction for qualifying donations made to IPCs to encourage more donations?Lastly – this is a very personal concern for me – I fear for that the mental health of our fellow Singaporeans in these difficult times. AWARE has reported a massive increase in the number of individuals seeking assistance from their domestic violence helpline. May I suggest that we commit to increasing the scope of support and monitoring for our at-risk households? People silently suffering in abusive households, struggling with unemployment or financial distress are the hardest hit in these trying times. We are in this fight against COVID-19 for the long haul and building up the mental well-being of our society is critical in enabling us to respond with resilience. I wonder if more can be done to ensure no one suffers in silence, to ensure that it is not just the vocal minority that are heard, but the silent majority as well.Ultimately, fear is a natural human emotion. If properly managed, I believe that we will emerge stronger as a nation. Sir, we have two options with fear the word F-E-A-R. We can either “Forget Everything And Run” or “Face Everything And Rise”. The Singapore DNA is all about the latter. This leads me to my final point on Hope.Mr Speaker, perspective is always an important thing. Here, I am hopeful because COVID-19 is not just a challenge. The circumstances today offer a perfect opportunity to consider what a future Singapore will look like. Here, I speak of Hope.Firstly, I am hopeful that this period will be a period of reflection that will allow us to see the importance of environmental sustainability. I am sure Members of this House are no doubt aware of the impact which the global shutting of businesses has had on the world. In China, pollution dropped by over a third. In India, the smog which used to cover the cities has disappeared. While the extent of Singapore’s pollution is not as severe, these examples highlight the destructive impact on our environment.COVID-19 presents us an opportunity to re-imagine our nation. More than simply relying on our obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement, I urge this House to envision a carbon neutral economy. I urge this House to consider the potential of an economy which will not harm our grandchildren. Sir, my first hope, is a proper consideration of a sustainable future.Secondly, I hope that our House will consider the future of work. As I speak, over 75% of our nation is working from home. The old norms of doing business have quite literally disappeared overnight. Telecommuting and flexi-work arrangements are no longer exclusive to fancy tech companies. Instead, they are a necessity in this climate. I hope that this House will consider how we will institutionalise this practice when we reignite our economy. Sir, the future of work could quite literally be in our hands right now.Additionally, I hope that we will consider the way we value each other. I began my speech by thanking our healthcare heros. However, I wish to make clear that simple platitudes, or even clapping at 8.00 pm, is not enough. I feel that the current system should be re-balanced to raise the salaries of workers in sectors absolutely critical to Singapore. To highlight, some of our nurses average only $3,000 a month despite several years of experience. Sir, we must look into this.Ultimately, I hope that this crisis reminds all of us how important steward leadership is. From our Prime Minister, to the Multi-Ministry Task Force, to fellow Singaporeans have shown us the brand of leadership that Singapore can deliver and truly deserves. To steal a line from the Officer’s Creed: I hope that we will always serve with such honour and integrity.This fight is far from over and each of us must act responsibly and stand resolute in overcoming COVID-19. Mr Speaker I support all three Budgets.Mr Speaker: Leader, please proceed."

        "Content": "The Chairman: Head L, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.Sustainability and Climate ChangeEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon): Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".Climate change is a significant problem. We have witnessed its far-reaching effects in many countries, from droughts and floods to bush fires. We are fortunate that thus far, we have not had to grapple with direct effects of natural disasters caused by climate change. However, being a huge importer of food products, we are at the mercy of the global situation.The Government established the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) last year to ensure and secure a supply of safe food and it has done good work to improve sustainability of our food sources.Hygiene and food safety are essential to sustainability of food sources. In recent years, there have been several high-profile instances of food hygiene lapses. I would like to ask how has formation of SFA helped to tackle food hygiene issues? How does SFA balance strengthening the food hygiene regime without causing an rise in businesscost? How does SFA ensure that the food industry continue to build a strong food safety culture even as globalisation and technological advancements transform the food landscape.The battle to reduce plastic usage is essential for environmental sustainability. The Ministry is implementing the mandatory packaging reporting framework this year, with the aim to reduce packaging waste including plastics. This is something new to everyone and, certainly, some companies will require more than a little guidance in the initial stages of implementation.Does the Ministry have plans to work with the industry to provide support for affected companies? Will the framework be tailored accordingly to different industries? Will it be applied to only local businesses, or also extended to imports, and how will that be implemented?Packaging is often used for branding and marketing purposes. Some local businesses will likely proclaim the competition to be unfair if the imported goods may maintain their fancy and more aesthetically appealing packaging with little or no penalty.I also note that with the COVID-19 outbreak, many sanitation products were frequently out of stock. Were F&B businesses and places, where food is served or handled, affected by the shortages, and how did they cope with it? How do we ensure enough supplies especially for hygiene in public toilets?On the subject of food, food waste remains a significant problem. The Ministry had earlier announced that owners and occupiers of commercial and industrial premises which generate large amounts of food waste will be required to segregate their food waste for treatment from 2024. Can the Ministry share if the scope of affected premises and thresholds have been determined? Are there measures in place to help the industry comply with the requirements? Do hawker centres, coffeeshops, supermarkets fall under this regulation? Will this cause an increase in operationcosts?1.30 pmIn the last two years, many people were affected by food poisoning incidents as a result of improper hygiene and cleaning practices at places such as pre-schools and food establishments? How do we foster greater responsibility by businesses and society to raise cleanliness and hygiene standards in Singapore?Each and every Singaporean must regard environment conservation as our duty. We may be a small dot on the globe, but we are heating up twice as fast as the rest of the world, as a result of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. As an island-city, it is inevitable for us to have many urban surfaces like buildings and roads. Heat generated from our large, high-density population gives rise to UHI effect. We need to reduce the rate at which we are heating up.The Government has been working very hard to increase the amount of greenery on our island, which has offered some relief from the heat. I am grateful to NParks for the intensified greening in Singapore in general and Yishun, in particular. With the increase in number of trees and bushes, the area has become a much cooler and more pleasant environment for the residents.We are starting to see some new innovative green architecture around the island and I hope some of the existing buildings and infrastructure may soon get a makeover as well. My Nee Soon South CC is being upgraded to become a net-zero energy building. I am very excited about it.I hope the Government will set bold national goals, to make it mandatory for high green coverage on new buildings or even to make them net-zero energy or energy-positive buildings. Doing so will stimulate even more innovation and creativity in the building industries. I believe our implementation of photovoltaic (PV) systems could be more extensive.I really like what Khoo Teck Puat Hospital has done with their roof tops, which is an energy-saving, green and sustainable combination of community gardens, farms and PV. Moreover, PVs, with their large, flat surfaces, could be designed for multiple functions, such as providing shelters from the sun and rain aside from collecting energy. They could be designed to complement the aesthetics of the buildings they serve.Climate change is a crisis but the Chinese term for crisis \"危机\" is also made up by two characters, which means danger and opportunity. There are plenty of opportunities if we set our minds to adopting bold changes and strategies. Climate change is now a major concern for many world leaders. If we can set an example and come up with viable solutions to address climate challenges, Singapore would stand among the world leaders in addressing this major crisis, thus securing our relevance in the globe.There is clearly a lot of local talent in our country. Since the rise in popularity of green buildings, many of our architects, planners and engineering professionals have risen to the occasion. Their projects combining greenery and unique architecture have captured attention worldwide and even appeal to travellers for their \"Instagram-worthy\" appearances.There are also many ground-up initiatives, ranging from classes on making your own compost, to roundtable discussions, really free markets to exchange and give away unwanted items and so on. Can we pool their expertise together so there is a more coordinated approach and sharing of resources? In Nee Soon South, I intend to turn our under-utilised multi-storey carpark (MSCP) rooftop into high-tech community farm. I would like to ask the Minister: is there any funding available?Singaporeans, especially the younger generation, are big on sustainable initiatives. There is also plenty of talent and expertise. The Government must take the lead and strike while the iron is hot. Together, let us make this little red dot a shining example to the world.And today is World Engineering Day. I would like to take this opportunity pay tribute to all the engineers, including our MEWR Minister, and his team in MEWR for working very hard and come up with very innovative engineering solutions to make this world a better place to live in. And I am also very proud to be an engineer.Question proposed.The Chairman: Mr Dennis Tan, take your two cuts together.Carbon Sinks in SingaporeMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member): Mr Chairman, it was reported that land in Singapore changed from a net absorber of carbon in 2012 to a net emitter in 2014.According to NParks, this is due largely to land conversion from forests and other vegetated areas to settlements. This is particularly concerning, as over the past few years, we have seen the prioritisation of development projects over the benefits afforded by sensitive eco-systems due to such projects as the Cross Island Line, the Tengah HDB project and the Mandai project.Will the Government be committed to securing the inviolability of our nature reserves and greater protection of the little that is left of our more natural green eco-systems in the future? Apart from the forest significant heritage and ecological value, they provide Singapore with carbon sinks, important in our urban environment and helps mitigate the urban island heat effect.I also understand that Singapore uses satellite images covering all land use classes and the five carbon pools, as defined by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and have established permanent sampling plots across the nation for the tracking of carbon in relevant land use classes.I would like to ask the Minister how have or how can such efforts help Singapore improve tree bio-mass growth rates so as to preserve and build more carbon sinks. Will the forest restoration action plan, as announced by NParks in January 2019, help in converting land in Singapore back to a net absorber of carbon?Emissions from Oil Refining IndustriesMy next cut. Singapore's energy and chemicals industry sector contributes to about 60% of Singapore's total emissions. Around three-quarters of these industry sectors emissions come from the oil refining and petrochemical sector. The Government has set a carbon tax of $5 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent for five years and plans to review it by 2023 with the intention of raising the carbon text to between $10 and $15 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030.Industrial energy efficiency, particularly for large emitters is currently being addressed by the Energy Conservation Act (ECA). Large emitters are required under the ECA to submit annual energy efficiency improvement plans. From 2021, these emitters must also establish facility-wide energy management systems and conduct energy efficiency opportunities assessments which must be submitted to NEA.I would like to ask the Minister how successful has the ECA been in improving industrial energy efficiency for our energy and chemicals industry and more specifically, for our oil refining Industries in the past five years? Can the public have access to aggregated information on the improvements?Minister Masago said in his Parliamentary Question reply to me last month that the Government works closely with the oil refining industry to ensure that they achieve high standards of energy efficiency and adopt sustainable practices; and that all three oil refineries in Singapore have set up co-generation plants, which can significantly improve the energy efficiency of the refineries. Has the Government set any projection or targets for emissions reductions for our refining industry in the next five years? And if so, what are these? And if not, will the Government consider doing so?Carbon AuditingAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member): Chairman, Sir, it has been one year since the carbon tax has come into effect and last Friday, Senior Minister Teo announced the goal of capping Singapore's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, halving it by 2050, and eventually achieving net-zero emissions. I support this goal.What we need now is the commitment by Government and businesses to actually reduce emissions and track it. In Australia, carbon neutral certification under the Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard is an example of how the government supports businesses as they account for and reduce carbon emissions. The Energy Conservation Act currently requires large energy users in the industry and transport sectors to monitor and report energy usage and conduct energy efficiency assessments. A similar framework can be applied to carbon emissions. We should, in the journey to halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, require all Government bodies and large companies to conduct annual carbon auditing.There are a variety of carbon management services available in the market today. With carbon auditing, organisations can understand their greenhouse inventory, isolate each emission source, and hence, determine and model emission reduction strategies, their payback and viability.To help ease organisations into this, the Government could implement carbon auditing subsidies for the next 10 years. If companies successfully reduce their carbon emissions year on year, incremental subsidies can incentivise them to continue to do so.Other ways to encourage a greener report card could be doubling on handouts for low-carbon initiatives and progressive carbon tax relief. In 2019, the UK set a new target of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with ambitious policies and generous funding to support this. More has to be done and decisively so, or the climate emergency will continue to worsen.Mr Tan Chuan-Jin: Mr Louis Ng, you can take all your cuts together.Promoting the Use of Solar EnergyMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): Sir, the Young PAP held a focus group discussion last month with 16 climate activists and drafted 24 recommendations. These included incentivising solar energy, which is the most viable clean energy source in Singapore.In Nee Soon, 64% of the electricity for municipal fittings is from solar energy. We should all move towards being fully solar powered.Will MEWR provide incentives to encourage solar deployment on rooftops and also provide consumers with rebates for electricity plans that use solar energy? Will MEWR also deploy more floating solar panels at our reservoirs?Bringing Forward the Carbon Tax ReviewNext, climate change is an existential threat. I am glad we have introduced the carbon tax to fight climate change.  However, the current $5 per tonne carbon tax rate is too low. The timeline for reviewing the rate is also too long. The Ministry plans to review the tax only by 2023 and increase it to only $10 to $15 by 2030.The minimum rate required by 2020 to reach the Paris Agreement temperature target is estimated at $54.Young PAP and climate activists hope we bring forward the 2023 review and increase the rate to more than $15 per tonne.Releasing Emissions DataNext, MEWR has said that it will not disclose the carbon tax contributions of companies because the tax was meant only as a price signal. But a tool can have multiple uses.Releasing emissions data by company and facility is not a new idea. The EU publishes the emissions of 15,000 facilities. The UK requires its 2,000 listed companies to declare their emissions. The German Institute of Economic Research has found that such company-level disclosures work, reducing emissions by 17% permanently.What I am proposing is a carefully targeted measure. We publish only the data of those that pay the tax. This means only the highest emitters will face pressure. It also means they can stop being published by cutting their emissions. A carrot and a stick.MEWR says the Carbon Pricing Act does not allow release of the data. If that is true, we can amend the Act.The fight against climate change should be built on transparency. Young PAP and climate activists both agree. Will MEWR study the idea of releasing emissions data on taxable facilities and companies?Greening Our Private Passenger Car FleetNext, it is positive news that we have committed to having a fleet of local public buses that runs on cleaner energy by 2040. It is also good news that we intend to phase out internal combustion engines (ICE) and have vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040.1.45 pmBut this will take time as we need to expand the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. In the meantime, we can steer Singapore towards an environmentally-friendly car society by improving the Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES). Currently, a hybrid carcosts more – a lot more. Will the Ministry consider offering higher rebates under the current VES and increasing surcharges for vehicles with higher emissions?I understand that we are not in the business of making cars cheaper, but we are in the business of protecting our environment. We can do this by urging people and steering them towards purchasing hybrid cars in the next 10 years, again before the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles is ready.It is also good news that we will be extending the VES to light commercial vehicles. Can MEWR provide more details about this?Reducing Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) Use and EmissionNext, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), commonly used in refrigerators and air-conditioners, are greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. NEA has put in place licensing controls for the import, export and manufacture of 18 types of HFCs which took effect from 1 January 2019. However, Singapore has not yet ratified the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol which requires parties to phase-down the production and consumption of HFCs.Can the Ministry share whether Singapore will ratify the Kigali Amendment and share its plans to further reduce the use and emission of HFCs in Singapore?Reporting Public Service Carbon UseTemasek has taken a strong lead in tackling climate change and is urging everyone to join them. As Mdm Ho Ching said a few months ago, \"Some businesses have already planned for 100% renewable energy before or by 2050. Others are setting yearly goals to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. For those of us who have not started, I propose that we take a simple step, to report our electricity and transport usage by next financial year. This is very simple; whether you are big or small, it is a very simple step to take. It is a proxy for our indirect emissions. Once we track and measure, as all businesses know, we can start to scope our solutions to reduce emissions or reduce waste.\"Can the Ministry follow Temasek and take the very simple step of reporting its electricity, paper, travel and water usage? Can the Public Service also follow Temasek and pledge to go carbon-neutral by this year and, like Temasek, ensure that “Sustainability is not just one of our roles. It is at the core of everything we do.”Banning Disposables for Public ServiceLastly, in Nee Soon East, we have launched our Zero Waste Masterplan. We have saved 39,792 disposables – single-use plates, forks, spoons, bowls and cups – since the launch of our Masterplan in April last year. We no longer use disposables at Nee Soon East CC events. This year, we will expand it to all our RC events.We have saved so much. At the same time, it is shocking to me that we have used so much in less than a year. If we can save so much in Nee Soon East, imagine how much we can save if more were to join us on this \"Say Yes to Waste Less Journey\". I know that MEWR is already doing this. Will the entire Public Service commit to end the use of all disposables at all Public Service events?Climate Change and Household AppliancesDr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar): Mr Chairman, high usage of air-conditioning and refrigerators contributes to global warming, and none more so than in Singapore where we love our climate control and air-conditioning. But as a responsible member of the global community, we should do our best to reduce our carbon footprint. Ideally, our cooling appliances should be energy-efficient and operate using refrigerant gas with a lower global warming potential.Many refrigerants have a global warming potential that can be over 1,000 times as potent as carbon dioxide. The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol aims to reduce hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants by over 80% over the next 30 years.I would like to ask to what extent are refrigerators and air-conditioners and other cooling equipment which are both energy-efficient and use refrigerants with low global warming potential available in our market today? How will the Ministry help our consumers make more climate-friendly choices for their household appliances?Tackling Climate ChangeMr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member): Chairman, I will be focusing on the two funds created in Budget 2020. Sir, I note that Budget 2020 is creating two pots of money in order to combat climate change – the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund and the SG Eco Fund. My questions are related to these policies and I commend MEWR for taking this step to set up these two funds in its fight against climate change.On the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund, what immediate investments will be made from the initial $5 billion? Will any funds be allocated towards understanding the pollutive effects of each industry and reducing the levels of pollution? In this regard, are there any plans to incorporate sustainability as a factor in our Industry Transformation Roadmaps?The next questions on the SG Eco-Fund flow from my concerns regarding the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund. What sort of projects does the Ministry expect to fund using this fund and how does this differ from the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund? What sort of measurable impact does the Ministry expect that this fund will have? Lastly, what plans does the Ministry have to co-create sustainability with Singaporeans? It is very important that we bring Singaporeans onboard this entire journey and process and allow us to help them co-create the future.Finally, our economy must reflect our priorities. I wonder whether these funds or any funds are available to create \"green\" jobs and equip our fellow Singaporeans with the skills needed to support our paradigm shift in sustainability. Specifically, how will the investments mentioned above support our economy? What steps is the Ministry taking to open up opportunities for industries and our workers in Singapore?Flood Resilience and Coastal ProtectionMiss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines): Sir, the rise in global sea levels has accelerated in recent decades due to the melting ice sheets. Researchers projected that 13.6% to 15.2% of global beaches will be lost by 2050. As an island state, sea level rise is an existential issue for Singapore. The Prime Minister shared at the 2019 National Day Rally that the UN currently projects that sea levels will rise by up to one metre by the end of this century, or 80 years from now.It was also shared that Singapore would need $100 billion or more over 100 years to build our coastal defences to protect ourselves. It is thus timely that this Budget introduced the $5 billion Coastal and Flood Protection Fund. Can the Minister provide an update and details of the plans to build up our coastal defences?And as building coastal defence against sea levels would likely involve multiple agencies and stakeholders, can the Minister also provide details of the Government's strategy to coordinate our coastal protection efforts?Flood Resilience and Vector ControlMr Desmond Choo (Tampines): Since Singapore's Independence in 1965, we have faced two primary water management challenges – scarcity of fresh water and flood risk. As a low-lying country, we faced the threat and damage of inland flooding. At the same time, we need to manage our scarce water resources well.History shows floods have had a long-running effect on Singapore – national records remind us of the extensive floods in Newton Circus in December 1969, Rochor Canal in November 1973 and Braddell Road in December 1978. We have certainly come a very long way.From 2013, there have been several flash floods with floodwaters up to half a metre deep. With climate change picking up, Singapore will experience increasingly extreme and unpredictable weather, probably resulting in more frequent and intense storms. What are PUB's future plans to mitigate against inland floods in the face of this challenge?PUB has undertaken significant infrastructure developments, including the construction of the Stamford Diversion Canal and the Stamford Detention Tank, to protect the Stamford catchment and the Orchard Road area. There was also a $300 million seven-year-long upgrade of the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal. Have these helped to prevent floods and strengthen Singapore’s flood resilience? Are there any more of such major drainage projects that PUB plans to undertake?In addition, how do we tackle flood risk and balance this against societal affordability? Could othercost-efficient options, including green infrastructure, green areas that retain rainwater and mangrove restoration, be further reviewed? How is the Government also getting the commercial property developers to do their part for flood mitigation?Also essential are monitoring and public communication systems that alert populations to flooded areas, such as the ones PUB has developed, to provide early warning of risky, flooded areas. How can we further enhance those systems?At the National Day Rally in 2019, Prime Minister Lee mentioned that the sea level rise is an \"existential issue\". We have committed at least $100 billion to build up coastal defences. The severity and enormity of the challenge requires us to plan way ahead but execute quickly. What is the progress of the Ministry’s efforts and what are the concrete measures that have already been embarked upon? When can the public expect to see the overall blueprint?Coastal protection will require balancing of varying needs. For example, protecting our coastlines with sea walls and polders might have permanent ecological impact. It might have impact on shipping lanes, underwater cable infrastructure, maritime security and international relations. It is extensive work that cuts across multiple agencies. Would the Ministry consider setting up a one-stop agency to coordinate Coastal Protection work?Coastal Protection and Flood Mitigation can also bring about significant economic opportunities for Singaporeans. While we learn extensively from the Dutch experts on, for example, polder work, how are we localising such knowledge? Are we also building up a pipeline of local talent in such work so that it might result in another \"Water Story\" for Singapore? Because of the vast capital needs of such projects, local companies might not be able to participate in this important national project. How is the Ministry ensuring that our local firms can participate and that there is sufficient technology transfer?The Government expects to spend more than $100 billion. What principle would be used for financing such projects, noting the need to balance inter-generational needs?Lastly, dengue has become a tropical disease that we have to live with. Because of climate change, Singapore is experiencing warmer temperatures. That might worsen the dengue situation. How does this affect our longer term dengue management strategy?DengueMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied): While COVID-19 takes our immediate attention, dengue continues to be a persistent challenge that also deserves significant attention. Indeed, dengue case numbers for the beginning of this year have spiked against the same period last year and there are several live clusters in certain estates in Aljunied GRC. Residents remain concerned even as they appreciate the diligence of NEA teams in the area. The warmer weather in the coming months could lead to an even higher mosquito population.In an update in January, NEA has noted the threat from the DENV-3 serotype, a strain of dengue not dominant in more than 30 years. Dengue strains have, in the past, switched from DENV-1 and DENV-2, but NEA has noted a recent increase in DENV-3 cases in three large dengue clusters in Singapore. While NEA has stated that it is still too early to say that there had been a switch of the dominant serotype, low herd immunity towards the new strain will leave Singaporeans vulnerable to a large outbreak.In terms of anti-dengue strategy, there was previous discussion about the prospects of a dengue vaccine. However, recent experience from other countries which have tried a vaccine has cast doubts about its efficacy and highlighted potential health risks.Controlling the mosquito population may have better and more immediate prospects. Project Wolbachia is a promising technology for vector control, where infected mosquitoes are deployed for sterile breeding. The project has been expanded in Singapore but it is still under study and is not deployed in existing dengue clusters.Long-term, with climate change and global warming, mosquitoes are poised to breed faster, and the virus replication may also be accelerated.In the light of these developments, has the Government adjusted its dengue containment strategies, both short-term and long-term? Also, how has NEA coped with the manpower challenges of such outbreaks and leveraged technology to augment its manpower?Vector ControlThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin): Warmer temperatures can potentially lead to an increase in mosquito population and spread of vector-borne diseases, including dengue. How will the impact of climate change affect dengue management?This year, the number of dengue cases is concerning. There is an increasing number of dengue cases of serotype 3. Singapore needs to be vigilant and be on the alert. Can the Ministry share any new plans for dengue management? How does Project Wolbachia fit into these plans?Dengue and Vector ControlDr Chia Shi-Lu: Chairman, even as we battle the COVID-19 outbreak, another health threat is already facing us and it has been facing us for a long while. Since the beginning of the year, the number of dengue infections has been increasing. Last week, NEA reported 110 dengue clusters, of which 25 are at red alert level. Even as I speak, my constituency of Queenstown has three active dengue clusters and one could argue that the dengue problem could pose an even larger and more real threat to Queenstown and to the rest of Singapore than even COVID-19.Singapore has been seeing warmer temperatures in recent years as a consequence of global warming, punctuated by more frequent showers, which provide fertile grounds for mosquito breeding. How will the impact of climate change affect our dengue management strategies? What are the Ministry’s plans for dengue management in the future and how does Project Wolbachia fit into our national strategy to combat the dengue menace? Will the Ministry please provide an update on the project to date and whether it would be expanded to other areas in Singapore?2.00 pmIn addition, I would like to ask whether the Ministry is satisfied with the results of our public education and campaign to prevent mosquito breeding? And how have industries and households responded to enforcement measures?The Chairman: Mr Louis Ng, take your two cuts together.Expanding Project WolbachiaMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: Sir, Nee Soon East residents have benefited from Project Wolbachia and it has led to a 90% drop in the mosquito population in Nee Soon East. It is good news, but many residents still have concerns about this project.Many ask me why we are releasing mosquitoes that will bite them. I tell them we are only releasing male mosquitoes and \"Males don’t bite\".The next concern is that they tell me the males will attract the females who will then bite them. I tell them do not worry, it is the males who look for the females.Can MEWR share how we will be increasing awareness about this Project and also whether there are further plans to expand this to other parts of Singapore so more people can benefit from it?Introducing a Food Donation ActNext. Food waste is a serious and growing problem. In 2018, 763,000 tonnes of food was wasted in Singapore, a 30% increase compared to 10 years ago. At the same time, some Singaporeans struggle to have three meals a day.Both problems can be alleviated if we introduce a Good Samaritan Food Donation Act. This piece of legislation would help encourage companies and organisations to donate healthy food that would otherwise go to waste. It will help both the environment and our people. Will MEWR support a Private Member's Bill for a Good Samaritan Food Donation Act?The Chairman: Mr Gan Thiam Poh, both cuts, please.Import Source DiversificationMr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio): Chairman, the COVID-19 crisis highlights the importance of having diverse sources of supply for all our imported goods. Singapore is particularly vulnerable since we are so reliant on imports. It is natural to want to order more from particular trading partners which are reliable and offer good value for money. However, this will consequently reduce the imports from other sources.Being mindful of the risks of over-dependence on any one particular supplier or region, we must make it a strategic national security decision to diversify our imports, even if it means that it may be lesscost-effective. Would the Ministry provide an update on how it ensures a robust import strategy to prevent supply disruptions, price hikes and supply fluctuations?Local Food Source SustainabilityNext, as we import most of our food, we are vulnerable to external shocks that affect food supplies at their sources. Potential food supply disruptions could come from unexpected or extreme weather conditions, problems with transport routes or delivery modes, export bans, or even crises such as the COVID-19 outbreak. Hence, diversification of our food import sources is critical and in addition, to enhance our food security, we have set for ourselves the \"30-30\" goal to produce 30% of our nutritional needs domestically by 2030. Singapore currently produces less than 10% of her nutritional needs domestically. Would the Ministry share an update on how we could achieve the 30-30 goal and what measures and incentives are available to encourage Singaporeans to seize the new opportunities in our food production sector?The Chairman: Miss Cheng Li Hui, both cuts, please.Local Food ProductionMiss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines): Sir, last year the Ministry announced the formation of the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and our ambitious \"30 by 30\" goal to raise Singapore’s food production level from the current 10% to 30% by the year 2030.Singapore relies heavily on imported food. About 90% of our food needs come from over 160 countries. As such, Singapore is especially vulnerable to disruptions in the global food supply chain and to price fluctuations.Deputy Prime Minister shared in his Budget speech that our imported supplies could also come under strain from climate change or geopolitical tensions.In land-scare Singapore, our approach to realising our \"30 by 30\" goal must be meticulously planned and carefully calibrated. With only 1% of land mass allocated to agriculture, we face a big challenge in growing our own produce. It is, therefore, important that Singapore focus on R&D to harness technological advances to boost local food production.Can the Minister elaborate on what are the challenges and opportunities for Singapore associated with our goal? Can the Minister also share the progress on our vertical farming and fish farming? How can we reach our 30-30 goal and help our local agri-food sector grow sustainably in the long run?Novel FoodsNext. Sir, the adoption of novel food by Singaporeans has grown recently. Today, Impossible burgers is well received in Singapore. I just heard that we are going to have Impossible gyoza for tea later. As we gravitate toward plant-based foods, SFA has a responsibility to ensure that they are safe for consumption.A framework is being set up by SFA to look into the safety assessment criteria of novel food. There will also be opportunities for our food industry to grow our presence in this area. Can the Minister share how is SFA facilitating the business opportunities in this area while ensuring food safety is protected?The Chairman: Mr Gan Thiam Poh, take your two cuts, please.Support LocalMr Gan Thiam Poh: Sir, in order to reach our 30-30 goal of producing 30% of domestic nutritional needs by 2030, our agri-food sector needs funding and technological support to ramp up production. It is an ambitious goal as we only produce less than 10% locally today. To overcome our land, water and human resource constraints, we need to adopt innovative solutions and tap on technology to optimise productivity. We will continue to need a lot of support from R&D.As food supply reliability is a fundamental national security issue, we must strengthen our resolve to make the endeavor a success. Can the Ministry provide an update on what the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) is doing to support our local farmers to help them succeed in the face of stiff competition in a free and open market?SG Eco FundNext. The launch of a SG Eco Fund by the Ministry to support partnerships with the community and enterprises in our sustainability efforts is much welcomed. Indeed, Singaporeans are becoming more aware of the importance of sustainability in every aspect of our lives. From renewable energy to reducing plastic and e-waste, conserving our precious water resource to making sustainable food choices, we all hope to contribute in our own ways in the attempt to become a low carbon, low emissions country; and we are all putting in more effort into supporting sustainability efforts. Can the Ministry share more details about the projects which Singaporeans and companies can apply for under this new SG Eco Fund?Review of Year Towards Zero WasteMr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied): Sir, zero waste is an effort that members of the public as consumers can be engaged in to great effect. All of us can take action to reduce, reuse, recycle and refuse waste. Twenty-nineteen was designated by the Ministry as the Year towards zero waste to rally Singaporeans to care for our environment and treasure our resources.May I ask for a review of its results and lessons in view of the goals enumerated in the Zero Waste Master Plan and for an update of the Ministry's efforts in this area.Recycling BinsMs Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar): Sir, with increasing awareness of the importance of recycling, more residents are bringing recyclable items to the blue recycling bins in our housing estates. However, very often, the bins are full and residents end up leaving their items around the bins. The reason these bins fill up so quickly is that many plastic bottles and tins can be quite bulky, such as bleach bottles and Milo tins. Add piles of newspaper and cardboard packaging waste, and the contributed items accumulate very quickly.Hence, I would like to request that we increase the size of the bins or allocate more bins to each HDB block. I hope that their designs can also be improved to make them more user-friendly. Some big items simply do not fit into the bin slots.RecyclingAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong: Chairman, I think I have mentioned this many times now, but we are a failure when it comes to domestic recycling, which is stuck at a dismal 21% to 22% rate. Singaporeans are not recycling. We have an attitude of convenience and we depend on the Government to do everything.Sir, the Government has done what it can to encourage domestic recycling. There is a conspicuous blue bin with simplified images showing what should be recycled at every HDB block and specially marked recycling trucks picking up the recycled thrash regularly. I think it is time we change strategy to turn the National Recycling Programme into community-led recycling.Experience in Germany, South Korea and Taiwan, which have the highest rates of municipal recycling, show that when urban communities are mobilised to take ownership of recycling programmes, cultures and norms of recycling become entrenched. In Taiwan, waste collection is not an individual throwaway chore but a community ritual and recycling party where piped music from waste collection truck bring out local residents with bags of recyclables and mixed waste, and community volunteers help residents sort out the thrash properly.In Singapore, we have an urban set-up conducive for community recycling efforts. With blue bins located at each HDB block, local grassroots organisations can take ownership of the bins to monitor the recycling trend of each block, diagnose problems such as low rate of recycling or indiscriminate dumping of thrash, and organise targeted events or campaigns to educate the residents of the block.Use of Styrofoam Crockery and ProductsMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong: Mr Chairman, despite the move towards a greener, zero-waste nation, suppliers of fresh fruits and vegetables, meats and eggs as well as hawkers and cooked food sellers continue to use lots of styrofoam and plastic packaging. Of the 1.6 million tonnes of domestic waste disposed of in 2018, one-third is made up of packaging. More than half of this packaging is made of plastic, but only 4% of plastic waste is recycled.InCOS2018, citing Taiwan’s ban in single use plastics including straws, cups and shopping bags by 2030, I had asked about the Ministry’s plans to reduce the use of plastic disposables in Singapore involving either the restriction or the banning of single use plastic carrier bags, straws and disposable cups, containers and utensils.In 2016, the Government also said that it will not ban styrofoam products for food crockery and packaging but will seek to discourage hawkers from using disposable ware.We still see much styrofoam food crockery and packaging being used at hawker centres, coffee shops and other food outlets. I would like to ask for an update of the rate of use of styrofoam products in food crockery and packaging vis-à-vis other materials since 2016.Given their harmful effects on the environment, I would also like to ask whether the Government will conduct a review of the use of styrofoam products for food crockery and packaging use, and whether it will set any target to ban such products or if not, what measures it will take to either reduce or to disincentivise such uses in the next five years. I will also like to ask whether the Government will be looking into encouraging alternative single-use products usage, such as bamboo products.Introducing a Single-use Bag ChargeMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: Sir, in response to Fairprice's trial of reducing the use of plastic bags by charging customers 10 or 20 cents per transaction, Prime Minister said: \"It is a sensible approach: to make people conscious of the plastic bags they use, but not to ban plastic bags altogether. Using fewer plastic bags alone will not solve climate change or save the earth, but every bit counts. And making us conscious of our habits, and consider better alternatives, has value in itself.\"I agree with Prime Minister. I have been calling for a plastic bag charge since 2018. Countries around the world have introduced a plastic bag charge, and it works. In England, there was a 90% reduction. It was estimated that every person was using 10 bags in the most recent year, compared with 140 bags in 2014 before the charge was introduced.For a start and similar to England, will MEWR consider introducing a single-use bag charge and make it mandatory for large retailers and optional for smaller businesses and waive the charge for single-use bags for fresh food and meat items? This is for all single-use bags, not just plastic bags.Towards a Zero Waste NationMr Mohamed Irshad:Chairman, all Members of this Chamber agreed that climate change is an existential threat to our nation. To tackle this, I am heartened that last year, 2019, it was designated as Singapore's \"Zero Waste Year\", and we passed the Resource Sustainability Act (RSA), designed to promote resource sustainability. My following set of questions relates to the reflection of these priorities in Budget 2020.Firstly, allow me to focus on our implementation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes. Last year, this House legislated for an EPR scheme for e-waste. It envisioned licensed operators collecting and treating regulated consumer products on behalf of producers. Can the Ministry share the progress on this front? Namely:One, how many operators have applied for a license thus far and how many have been licensed?Two, do we have sufficient local recycling capabilities to treat the expected volume collected e-waste? What measures is the Ministry taking to ensure the proper treatment of all e-waste collected?And three, given our focus on transiting into a circular economy, are there any plans to expand our Producer Responsibility Schemes beyond just e-waste; and by 2025, perhaps, packaging waste?Four, what sort of progress has been made on the EPR scheme for packaging waste. What should the industry be expecting?Next, on the topic of packaging waste, I note that the Mandatory Packaging Reporting Framework will kick in on 1 July. What sort of support for affected companies will the Ministry be providing to ensure accurate data? Additionally, the framework merely requires reporting, even if they cross prescribed thresholds. Are there any plans and funds for the Ministry to work with the producers to implement their 3R plans?Lastly, on the topic of food waste, the Ministry previously announced that owners and occupiers of commercial and industrial premises which generate large amounts of food waste will be required to segregate their food waste for treatment from 2024. Can the Ministry share if the scope of affected premises and thresholds have been determined? Are there measures in place to help the industry comply with the requirements?2.15 pmThe Chairman: Dr Chia Shi-Lu, please take all your three cuts together.Managing Packaging and Plastic WasteDr Chia Shi-Lu: Mr Chairman, packaging forms a significant portion of the waste that is generated by domestic sources, which include households and trade premises, such as shophouses. Statistics from NEA show that one-third of our waste is packaging waste and 55% of that packaging waste is plastic. Considering that only 4% of our plastic waste is recycled, there is certainly potential to further reduce packaging and plastic waste.The Ministry had earlier announced plans to put in place an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework to deal with packaging waste, including plastics, no later than 2025 or, perhaps, even earlier. Under the EPR approach, producers bear the responsibility for the collection and treatment of their products when they reach end-of-life. Would the Ministry share more details about how NEA intends to implement and enforce these plans? Next cut.Responsible E-waste DisposalI am very happy with the Resource Sustainability Act which was passed last year. It is, I feel, one of the most important pieces of legislation introduced to deal with the increasing amounts of e-waste, food waste and packaging waste, including plastics, due to their quantities and low recycling rates.The Act will give effect to the EPR scheme for e-waste. The Ministry announced that a Producer Responsibility Scheme (PRS) Operator will be announced to collect and ensure proper treatment of regulated electrical and electronic consumer products on behalf of the producers. For non-consumer products, producers will be required to provide free take-back of all end-of-life commercial, industrial and electrical equipment before consigning them to licensed waste collectors or e-waste recyclers. Would the Ministry share the progress of the scheme's implementation for e-waste?Management of E-wasteLast cut. With the introduction of the Resource Sustainability Act last year, the EPR scheme will commence and a PRS operator I alluded to earlier will be appointed to collect and ensure proper disposal of electrical and electronic consumer products. For non-consummable products, producers will have to take back and transfer the equipment to licensed waste collectors or e-waste recyclers.Singapore generates about 60,000 tonnes of e-waste a year and the amount is expected to grow year on year. I would like to ask whether we have sufficient local recycling capabilities to process the expected volume of e-waste collected under this EPR? What measures will the Ministry implement to ensure the proper treatment and responsible disposal of all this e-waste that is collected?High-rise LitteringMr Gan Thiam Poh: Chairman, high-rise littering is a particularly dangerous offence which can cause serious injury or even result in death. I strongly urge the Ministry to utilise all available tools and technology at its disposal to prevent and deter this anti-social behavior. Rigorous enforcement should be conducted and heavy penalties meted out to offenders.I would like to ask for the latest available statistics for this offence and whether the trend is improving or worsening. What has been done to curb high-rise littering and whether the Ministry will be deploying more advanced technology or investigative techniques, such as identification through DNA? Could the Ministry also leverage more on the sense of shame, such as by increasing the visibility and duration of the Corrective Work Orders, to punish these high-rise litterbugs?Tray Return, Hygiene and Hawker CentresMr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee): Chairman, amidst this COVID-19 outbreak, much has been said about social responsibility and public hygiene. From Town Councils to offices, disinfection and constant cleaning has become the norm. This crisis affords us the opportunity to also reinforce the importance of social norms, such as in our hawker centres.For a number of years now, we have been promoting the concept of tray returns. Gradually, we have seen better response. Yet, we also see many previous innovations fall into disuse. In many older hawker centres, you see automated tray-return belts that have been switched off; coin-return machines that do not work; tray-return stations becoming manual stacking stations for cleaners.At the same time, the role of the tray is also very much temporary. Many remove their trays out of habit and place dishes onto tables. There is also a socially irresponsible behavior, such as the spitting of food waste and bones onto table surfaces, not just during COVID-19, but on any other day. This should be discouraged. Cleaners often do not have the adequate tools nor training to properly clean. Often, the same cloth is used. And one does not need to leave much to the imagination that the same food waste spat out onto tables ends up being smeared across the entire table.I, therefore, ask that MEWR and NEA promote the usage of trays while dining and not remove the tray itself. This way, the tray catches any spillage as well as any food waste or oral fluids. This means that conservancy contractors should also be incentivised to sterilise trays after each use. This reduces the workload of cleaners, promotes a clean hygienic eating environment and reduces the spread of diseases.To further achieve this, the design of hawker centres will also have to adapt. Some older hawker centres still use round tables, which are not conducive for the use of trays unlike rectangular tables in newer centres. Beyond COVID-19, I hope that this will promote better hygiene and social norms in Singapore.Socially-Conscious Enterprise Hawker Centre (SEHC) ModelMr Amrin Amin: In late 2018, the new management model of hawker centres came under public scrutiny. Key issues raised were high stall rentals and operatingcosts, including hiddencosts, long working hours and harsh contractual obligations.Several improvements have been made to the Socially-Conscious Enterprise Hawker (SEHC) model to better support hawkers. These include a review of contractual terms between the operators and stallholders, regular hawkers' feedback groups, Productive Hawker Centres grant and a staggered rental scheme with lower initialcosts for stallholders.MEWR previously announced a review of the SEHC model. Can MEWR provide an update on the implementation of these improvements? Have the issues been adequately addressed? Will new hawker centres continue to come under the SEHC model?Hawker CentresMr Gan Thiam Poh: Chairman, hawker centres are an important and integral part of Singapore life. Not only do they provide affordable, accessible, hygienic and good quality food, they also serve as essential social spaces where Singaporeans and visitors can gather to enjoy a good meal.In 2011, the Government had announced that it intended to build 20 new hawker centres by 2027. Are we still on track to meet this target?  How is the Ministry ensuring that the hawker trade can be sustained and how can productivity in hawker centres be raised in the face of manpower constraints? Would the Ministry also share an update on how well each of the new hawker centres are doing? Does the Ministry have any plans to review and enhance the present schemes for this sector?Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker CentresMr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied): Sir, first of all, I would like to correct my cut title of SCHC. It is supposed to be Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centre (SEHC) instead of Social Enterprise Hawker Centre.Sir, in the last quarter of 2018, there were media reports on hawkers' feedback pertaining to some challenges they faced in operating their food or drinks stalls under the SEHC scheme. Among the feedback were, having to apply for leave in advance if they choose not to open their stalls; not having the freedom to adjust food prices; having to pay penalty fees for terminating their tenancy; and high rentals and auxiliarycosts that the hawkers have to bear.The matter was addressed at length in Parliament in November 2018 with the Ministry sharing details, measures and giving assurances to Members of this House that the Ministry will manage or resolve the matter. It has been about a year and four months since then. Hence, I would like to seek updates on the current situation of the SEHC scheme.I would like to ask whether the Ministry has received any feedback from stall operators against any SEHC operators in 2019. If yes, what is the number of feedback received and what are among the most common ones. Additionally, I would like to seek updates on the number of SEHC island-wide at the present moment. I also would like to know whether the Ministry has conducted any recent survey or study in finding out the level of succession of stall owners operating under the scheme. If there is any, can the Ministry share the findings?Hawker Centres and Vector ControlMr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah): Sir, the decision by the Government to resume building hawker centres is perhaps the most tangible boost to safeguard our hawker food culture and a game-changing move to keep community dining affordable.These new hawker centres have operated under the Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centre (SEHC) model since 2015. This is a new approach and, understandably, the model would require continual adjustments and evolve into a viable and sustainable model.I must credit the Ministry and NEA for daring to try a new approach and taking the earlier criticisms of the model in stride, although not all are really fair criticisms. The model was reviewed in 2018 and there has been a number of finetuning and improvements since taking in the feedback from stakeholders and the public.From my recent conversations with some of the stallholders at Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre and the residents there that patronised the hawker centre, most had given me positive reviews for the new food centre. I am sure we can continually improve and finesse the model so that it can better serve the stallholders and residents.As NEA is now building a second hawker in Bukit Panjang town and within my constituency, I would like to seek an update whether there has been further review of the model and what are the further refinements that we can expect. Also, MEWR has set up two hawker workgroups last year. I would be interested to know what are their thoughts and recommendations so far.On vector control, last year, dengue cases in Singapore surged beyond 16,000. I was one of those infected as well. There were also 20 deaths, unfortunately. Dengue is endemic in Singapore because of the presence of Aedes mosquitoes, which are the vectors for dengue virus transmission.Hence, our strategy has very much been focused on vector control, in essence, to prevent Aedes mosquito from breeding as far as possible. This is a long-drawn battle and it requires constant vigilance on the part of everyone. Our environmental condition, especially our warm weather, also makes it conducive for such transmission. Singapore has seen warmer weathers in recent years, especially in 2019. It was, I understand, 0.9°C higher than the past average.Could the relatively warmer weather be the possible reasons for the surge in dengue cases in recent years? And if that is the case, how will the impact of climate change affect our management of dengue prevention?Recently, Project Wolbachia was rolled out to help reduce the dengue mosquito population. I commend the NEA for pushing the envelope and leveraging new technologies to tackle this serious threat to our public health. Having been a dengue patient myself last year, I know how it is like to live through the illness and, of course, the concern about fatality. We should spare no effort to minimise the cases of dengue in Singapore, not any less than how we manage COVID-19, and continue to seek new strategies to fight this virus.Hawker Rental RebatesMs Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar): Sir, part of the Stabilisation and Support Package in this Budget is one month's worth of rental waivers for hawker stalls managed by NEA. This will certainly help to alleviate the difficulties experienced by our hawkers due to the reduction in business from the COVID-19 outbreak. Many of these hawkers are worried about the outbreak deepening and prolonging, especially with the news of the virus spread in other countries. The spread will increase the risk of new imported cases from different sources. Would the Ministry consider providing more reliefs, such as more rental rebates, in the event of the outbreak worsening?New Jobs and Skills for SustainabilityMr Desmond Choo: The efforts to tackle our environmental changes require significant investment and transformation. We will probably lose some jobs but also create new ones. We will clearly need new skills in diverse areas. Can the Ministry share what are these critical skills needed to support our journey towards a sustainable and climate resilient Singapore?While we have some expertise, such as environmental engineering in Singapore, this might not be sufficient to fulfil our ambitions. Many of these skills might not be supported by existing education pathways. Furthermore, these are not traditional fields for Singaporean students. How does the Ministry plan to jumpstart and develop this field in our Institutes of Higher Learning? One way is perhaps to attract firms to set up their R&D facilities in Singapore to take advantage of our robust IP framework.As we move into more recycling, traditional waste management and recycling firms will need to transform. Will the Ministry be able to share what are the new jobs that might be created? What new opportunities will be available to our firms? How would the Ministry support them in their transformation?Second, the \"30-30\" food security target has excited many Singaporeans. Opportunities can include R&D, production, financing and entrepreneurship. What is the total economic value that we can generate if we reach our target local production? How many and what type of jobs can we expect to create in the Food Story space? How are we preparing our younger Singaporeans in their education towards working in these food-related industries as the target is only 10 years away?In our journey to be more sustainable, water and food secure, some workers in traditional industries will be adversely affected. How is the Ministry supporting job re-design and helping these workers to find higher-value work in their current industries?2.30 pmThe Chairman: Minister Masagos Zulkifli.The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M): Mr Chairman, firstly, let me wish Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and all the engineers in the House today, Happy Engineer's Day.The United Nations (UN) has rightfully identified climate change as the defining issue of our time. For Singapore, like many small nations, climate change is an existential challenge. We feel its effects today, such as in rising temperatures and frequent extreme weather events. Even the seasonality of Singapore's rainy and dry months is now difficult to predict.Scientists in the Centre for Climate Research Singapore have projected that by 2100, end of the century, the mean sea level around Singapore may rise up to one metre. Coupled with the frequent and heavy storms also brought about by climate change, low-lying areas of Singapore such as the East Coast may experience more flooding.For all countries, climate change also threatens access to essential resources like water, food and energy. These affect the security of our nation too.With this said, our history of overcoming challenges gives me the confidence that we need not despair when facing climate change. We will create innovative solutions for the hardest challenge, putting Singapore in the unique position we enjoy today. This is Singapore's DNA.Today, I will update on our plans in three key areas to address the challenges of climate change – first, mitigation strategies to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases or GHGs; second, adaptation plans; and third, how we can work together, in our communities and as a nation, to collectively realise a more sustainable Singapore.With your permission, Mr Chairman, may I request the Clerks to distribute a document to Members?The Chairman: Yes, please. [A handout was distributed to hon Members.]Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Thank you. First, on mitigation. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement are pivotal multilateral agreements to address the global challenge of climate change. It has spurred many countries, including those who are large emitters, to enact laws and transform their economies to meet their carbon commitments. It is therefore in the interest of small island states like Singapore, to support this multilateral framework of cooperation.For this framework to stand, every country, large or small, must do its share to reduce GHG emissions. Singapore will also do our part.Last Friday, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean announced that Singapore will enhance our 2030 nationally determined contribution to the Paris Agreement later this year. We will also submit our Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy, which aspires to halve emissions from our peak to 33 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) by 2050, with a view to achieve net zero emissions as soon as possible in the second half of the century.Halving our emissions, even 30 years from now, is an ambitious target, because Singapore is naturally constrained in alternative energy. This is an attribute recognised even by the UNFCCC. But we will continue to raise our ambitions to limit and reduce carbon emissions over the long term, knowing well enough that it requires transformational change.We are already ahead of the pack by implementing the carbon tax last year – the first country in Southeast Asia to do so. This is a clear signal to the whole of industry that Singapore is moving towards a low-carbon economy, as we give no exemption.Mr Louis Ng and Mr Daniel Goh asked about the carbon tax and emissions reporting. The carbon tax, as I mentioned in the past Parliamentary Question, is meant to provide an economy-wide price signal. Hence, only aggregated information will be released. To achieve emissions reductions, rather than scrutinising individual companies, it would be more useful to know which sectors we should concentrate on. The release of individual data could also be commercially sensitive.What are the major moves that my Ministry will introduce to further reduce our GHG emissions?First, we will implement a package of comprehensive measures to reduce the emission of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs. As Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Mr Louis Ng have pointed out, HFCs can be found as refrigerants in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment, and could leak during installation, maintenance and disposal. Some forms of HFCs trap a much larger amount of heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.Later this year, NEA will launch a training course to train and certify technicians to handle refrigerants properly. From next year, NEA will mandate the proper recovery, reclamation and destruction of spent refrigerants.With your permission, Mr Chairman, may I display some slides on the screen?The Chairman: Yes, please. [Slides were shown to hon Members.]Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: NEA will also introduce a voluntary climate-friendly label to help households identify refrigerators and air-conditioners that use alternative refrigerants with lower global warming potential. In addition, NEA will launch a new grant to support companies who want to make an early switch to more climate-friendly commercial water-cooled chillers. From 2022, we intend to restrict the supply of commercial water-cooled chillers and household refrigerators and air-conditioners that use HFCs with high global warming potential.To Mr Louis Ng's question, MEWR will initiate a review on our ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol later this year.Besides HFCs, improving energy efficiency will have a major impact on emissions reduction.Mr Dennis Tan asked about our progress. We have set an ambitious target to improve our industrial energy efficiency to 1% to 2% every year. Our industries are on track to meet this target, and we will continue to improve our energy efficiency rates.Last year, NEA announced the Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards, or MEES, for industrial-chilled water cooling systems. MEES will reduce energy consumption in industrial facilities by at least 245 gigawatt hours (GWh) annually – equivalent to taking more than 20,000 cars off the road.From 2021, energy-intensive companies, including oil-refining companies, will be required to establish facility-wide energy management systems and conduct energy efficiency opportunities assessments.In MEWR, we also live by our energy efficiency creed. Let me illustrate this.We are on track to complete the development of Tuas Nexus by 2027. The Tuas Nexus carries out co-digestion of food waste and used water sludge to generate up to three times more biogas than conventional sludge treatment processes. This biogas will be used to generate electricity to power the plant and excess electricity will be exported back into the grid.In addition, we will ramp up the generation of solar energy within MEWR.Mr Louis Ng asked if we can deploy more solar panels on reservoirs. This year, PUB will deploy two 1.5 mega-watt peak (MWp) floating solar systems at Bedok and Lower Seletar Reservoirs. Next year, PUB will deploy the world's largest single floating solar system of 60 mega-watt peak at Tengeh Reservoir. The power generated from this system alone is sufficient to meet the energy of all our water treatment plants at local reservoirs. With this, Singapore's waterworks will be one of the few in the world to be 100% green.PUB is also making strides towards improving the energy efficiency of NEWater and desalinated water production.Mr Louis Ng also asked if the Government can provide consumers with rebates for using solar energy. Subsidies, such as rebates, distort the energy markets. Pricing energy right will encourage the growth of renewable energy in a commercially viable manner and incentivise consumers to use electricity efficiently, avoiding wasteful consumption.Instead of rebates, the Government has streamlined regulations and funded research to support higher deployment of solar.My Ministry also intends to be exemplary in optimising the water-energy-waste nexus. We will set out to generate sufficient energy from waste incineration and solar photovoltaic systems to power all of my Ministry's needs, especially in the production of water and the projected production of food.In the long run, it is only with groundbreaking technology that we can make huge leaps in climate mitigation. In the horizon are carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies, and the use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel. We will stay abreast of these developments.Beyond the Ministry, the Public sector as a whole is doing more. Mr Louis Ng asked about our efforts.In 2017, we launched the Public Sector Sustainability Plan, which charted out our strategies to reduce electricity and water consumption, and achieve Green Mark standards for 100% of our buildings. Ministries and agencies are working hard, and are on track to meet our 2020 targets.For example, all air-conditioned Government premises should maintain indoor temperatures of 24 degrees centigrade or higher where feasible. All Ministries have also taken the climate action pledge and committed to reducing their plastic, water and electricity consumption. We are reviewing how to bring our plan to the next level.The Deputy Prime Minister also announced our vision for all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040. The Government will take the lead. From 2023, all new vehicle purchases for Government-owned fleets will be cleaner and greener where feasible. MINDEF, for example, will replace 400 administrative vehicles with hybrids and later, with electric ones when charging infrastructure is ready in 2040.Together, with net-zero buildings, food waste management, our Army is \"green\" in more than in their uniforms.This are but a few examples of what I said earlier in my speech on how the UN Climate Change Framework is shaping climate-conscious behaviours and decisions. We are also reviewing other measures such as the better management of carbon emissions and the use of disposables. More details will be announced later this year.Mr Chairman, public transport generates up to three times less carbon dioxide than private transport. Hence, our approach is to encourage public transport and green public transport as far as possible. The Land Transport Master Plan 2040 by the Ministry of Transport (MOT) supports this.This is how Singapore moves to cut GHG emissions – simply drive less. If driving less is, somehow, not an option, motorists can still practise sustainable consumption by choosing cleaner vehicles that emit less GHG and harmful pollutants.Mr Louis Ng asked about the Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES). The VES implemented in 2018 has seen positive results and we have since extended the VES until end 2020. This will complement the enhanced incentives and infrastructure to promote the use of electric vehicles announced at the Budget. We aim to refine VES further, taking into account its impact on motorists' purchasing decisions and advancements in technology.The transport of goods and services is a major economic activity in Singapore. Commercial vehicles, especially Light Goods Vehicles or LGVs, are key emission sources and pollute our air due to their high mileage and reliance on diesel. To support the shift to cleaner commercial vehicles, we will introduce a new Commercial Vehicle Emissions Scheme (CVES) for new LGVs, which form the largest proportion of commercial vehicles.Under the new CVES, the cleanest LGVs will receive a $30,000 incentive, while the most polluting LGVs will incur a $10,000 surcharge. In terms of TotalCost of Ownership, fleet owners will enjoy overall savings when they purchase EVs as opposed to petrol vehicles and even greater savings as compared to diesel vehicles.2.45 pmTo complement the CVES, we will enhance the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS) from 1 April 2021 until 31 March 2023, including expanding the scheme to cover Euro 4 diesel commercial vehicles. The existing ETS will be extended until 31 March 2021.I have outlined our climate mitigation efforts. Let me now talk about how we will adapt to climate change.Climate change will bring about more frequent and intense storms, which may result in major flooding, especially in low-lying parts of Singapore. Mr Desmond Choo asked about PUB's plans to mitigate inland floods.Since 2011, PUB has spent almost $2 billion on drainage works, including major projects like the Bukit Timah Diversion Canal and Stamford Detention Tank. We will invest another $190 million, with six projects commencing this year, including the construction of a detention tank underneath Syed Alwi Road, which will enhance flood protection in the Little India area. Our investments will be complemented with developments in technology, such as short-range radars, to better predict and manage heavier rainfall.These efforts, however, will not be sufficient with climate change. With climate change, sea levels will rise faster than its natural cycle and along with heavy rains, will overwhelm drainage systems.Miss Cheng Li Hui and Mr Desmond Choo asked about our whole-of-nation strategy to coordinate coastal protection efforts. I am pleased to announce that PUB will assume the role of the national Coastal Protection Agency from April.With this new responsibility, one agency, PUB, will study both coastal and inland flooding holistically and develop models to guide our flood protection response.The investments to undertake coastal and flood protection couldcost $100 billion over the next 50 to 100 years. As announced by Deputy Prime Minister in the Budget speech, a Coastal and Flood Protection Fund will be set up within PUB, with an initial funding of $5 billion. The fund will be used in a fiscally sustainable manner to support the substantial capital outlay.Mr Mohamed Irshad asked about the immediate investments that will be made. Our near-term efforts will focus on studying our coastal areas to ascertain the type, feasibility and extent of measures required. We will phase efforts and start with the City to East Coast stretch and Jurong Island. The funds will also be used to expand and improve our drainage infrastructure to improve flood resilience.As we embark on coastal protection, we will also identify new opportunities for urban development. For instance, we could reclaim a series of islands offshore, and even connect these islands up by building barrages to create community spaces for Singaporeans and contribute to water resilience. PUB will partner various stakeholders to explore these possibilities.Mr Dennis Tan highlighted the importance of preserving and building our carbon sinks. We will preserve our green carbon sinks and identify nature-based solutions. For example, planting mangroves can both stabilise our coastline by preventing erosion, while preserving our green lungs and supporting biodiversity. Minister Desmond Lee will elaborate in his speech on Singapore's greening efforts.Adaptation efforts also involve securing our water supply. Singapore has developed a robust and diversified supply of water, as a result of our early and consistent investments in water infrastructure and research. Along with local catchment and imported water, we will continue to augment our water supply with weather-resilient sources, namely, NEWater and desalinated water.With the completion of Marina East and Jurong Island desalination plants this year, we will have five desalination plants. Our NEWater production capacity will also increase over the next five years, with the expansion of the Changi NEWater factory and development of Tuas Nexus.Good water demand management is equally important in complementing efforts in water supply. PUB's water conservation efforts have shown encouraging results, with household water consumption decreasing to 141 litres from 148 litres per person per day in three years. PUB will begin the deployment of 300,000 smart meters next year, as part of efforts to reduce water consumption further to 130 litres per person per day by 2030.To inspire Singaporeans to continue efforts in water conservation, I am happy to launch the 2020 water conservation campaign. I cannot do it now like the usual way, because of COVID-19.Today, PUB will kick off with a new video to remind Singaporeans of how far we have come in our water story. I feel touched and proud of our water story when I previewed the video. So will you, when you watch it tonight. It will encourage us, all Singaporeans, not to take our clean drinking water for granted.Besides rising sea levels and water resilience, Mr Amrin Amin, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Mr Desmond Choo have rightfully pointed out that warmer temperatures caused by climate change can also affect the everyday lives of Singaporeans, because it leads to an increasing mosquito population. In fact, warmer temperature is one of the factors that led to the surge in dengue cases last year.Project Wolbachia is a tool which NEA is piloting to manage the mosquito population. Mr Louis Ng conveyed feedback that the initial surge of male Aedes mosquitoes released under Project Wolbachia causes discomfort to residents.I hope to reassure residents that these male mosquitoes do not bite or transmit diseases – I say this in Parliament – and ask residents to be patient and bear with the initial surge. And I thank Mr Louis Ng for jointly spreading this message with us.I am pleased to say that the Project Wolbachia trials have achieved up to 90% suppression of the Aedes aegypti population within the Yishun and Tampines test sites. We are considering the expansion of Project Wolbachia to more neighbourhoods, in consultation with NEA's Dengue Expert Advisory Panel.To do this, NEA has set up a hi-tech mosquito farm which optimises mosquito production, the sorting of male mosquitoes from females and the transportation of mosquitoes for release. We are scaling up the facility's production to five million male mosquitoes a week, over the next few years, to battle dengue. This is a new and important means to future-proof ourselves against the faster breeding of mosquitoes, as a result of higher temperatures brought by climate change.Just as NEA is establishing mosquito farms, Singapore Food Agency (SFA) is transforming food farms.Food, like water, is a resource that can be disrupted by climate change. In Asia alone, we expect an additional 250 million mouths to feed by 2030. Yet, the amount of arable land could fall by 5% due to climate change and environmental degradation. Singapore, which currently imports more than 90% of our food, will be vulnerable.In the face of these changes, we have developed three food baskets to ensure our food security by diversifying food sources, growing food overseas and growing local. We have designated 2020 as the Year of Singapore Food story to focus our national effort and attention.Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about the Government's success in food source diversification and its role in mitigating price hikes during supply disruptions.Today, Singapore's food imports come from over 170 countries and regions. This did not come by chance, but is a result of SFA's continuous efforts. While the Government does our part, we require the industry to also be pro-active in diversifying supply sources to enhance business resiliency. For example, since last year, SFA has introduced requirements for egg importers to adopt plans to mitigate the impact of any supply disruptions.With a well-diversified food supply, Singapore can reduce the impact of food supply shortages and price changes. However, consumers need to be mindful that the price of any particular food item is determined by a combination of factors, including import prices, exchange rates and profit margins which suppliers can command.Let me elaborate on our plans to produce food locally, enhance food safety and encourage Singaporeans to support local produce.Miss Cheng Li Hui and Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about how the Government is helping the local agri-food industry grow. Our vision is to locally produce 30% of Singapore's nutritional needs by 2030, but from less than 10% today.As a small country with limited space, our land use faces many competing needs. We have dedicated less than 1% of our land for agriculture today. Within such tight land constraints, the \"30 by 30\" vision is highly ambitious, especially if we must achieve it within the same 1%.Yet, having visited some of our new-tech farms, I am optimistic that it is achievable if we invest in an innovative agri-food sector.Since 2017, SFA has been awarding agriculture land, through a competitive land tender basis, to agri-food companies with promising technologies. One such company is Green Harvest, a local vegetable farm. The farm uses modern greenhouse growing techniques which mitigates the impact of unfavourable weather conditions. We are helping them to adopt more technology and, with experience, we hope they can produce multiple times more vegetables than average.This year, SFA will study how the larger Lim Chu Kang agriculture area can be planned and redeveloped to enhance our food production. This study will consider feedback from farmers for centralised facilities and services to reduce thecost of food production. The study will also introduce circular economy principles, so that the by-product of one farm can be used as an input for another. SFA will work with farms, including successful tenders in recent land sales exercises, to work towards an exciting vision for Lim Chu Kang.SFA's plans for Lim Chu Kang will complement the development of the Agri-Food Innovation Park (AFIP), which we announced last year as a high-tech agri-food cluster in Sungei Kadut. The food production innovations developed in AFIP can scale up in Lim Chu Kang to contribute towards our \"30 by 30\" vision.SFA will also look to unlock the potential of farming at sea. Last week, I accompanied President Halimah to visit Eco-Ark. Eco-Ark's CEO Mr Leow Ban Tat, who had decades of experience in marine and off-shore engineering, including in Keppel, applied principles of oil rigs construction to that of a floating fish farm. He worked with his team to conceptualise, design and integrate a floating platform with closed-containment aquaculture technologies that treat influent sea water used to cultivate fish. These technologies mitigate the effects of pollution and algae blooms that threaten both farms and our marine environment. Ideas like this is how we will transform fish farming practices so that they are more productive, sustainable and climate-resilient.Besides the use of technology, SFA will study the expansion of sustainable fish farming, where applicable, in the deeper southern waters of Singapore. We will ensure that such aquaculture is productive and environmentally responsible, such as shown by Barramundi Asia, Singapore's first and only deep-sea fish farm. SFA will work with stakeholders to study this.We are supporting different modes of fish farming. Where water quality is good, farms can carry out deep sea farming. Where it is not, farms can adopt closed-containment technologies. Where there can be synergies with land-based water and waste systems, land-based aquaculture can be conducted.Like land, every space at sea can be used for food production but must be judiciously managed.3.00 pmMr Gan Thiam Poh also asked how the Government is helping local farms remain competitive. Over the years, our economic agencies have been supporting local farms in their overseas expansion. Growing their businesses overseas allow farms to tap on land and manpower, lower productioncosts, and break into new markets.I encourage our farms to take a leaf from the food manufacturing industry, where companies like Tee Yih Jia Food anchor their expertise locally while expanding operations overseas. Some of our farms, like Apollo, have already done so.These food products produced overseas, while not \"Made in Singapore\", should be marketed as \"Made by Singapore\", since they uphold the same reputation for high quality and standards as those produced domestically.To complement these efforts, SFA, Enterprise Singapore and the industry will be developing Clean-Green Standards for urban farms which harness resource-efficient technologies to produce food in cleaner environments. They will study ways to incorporate information that more people are concerned about, such as the carbon footprint of food they produce. The standards will serve as a mark of quality assurance that our farms can use to differentiate their products in the market.Let me move on to incentives and funding. Over the past five years, SFA has committed $38 million from the Agriculture Productivity Fund, or APF, to support more than 100 farms in their productivity-enhancing investments. I am happy to share that the APF will be extended till the end of 2020. Beyond this, we will review how we can expand our support for technology test-bedding, adoption and resource efficiency in our farms.New innovations to produce food more productively and sustainably are also needed. The first research grant call launched by SFA and A*STAR last December under the $144 million Singapore Food Story R&D Programme will facilitate this.One theme under this research programme is the production of novel foods, like alternative proteins. Traditional meat production methods are often land and water intensive, and generate high levels of emissions. Today, alternative proteins, such as Impossible and Quorn, are poised to become game-changers. I hope Members will enjoy the alternative protein food items from Tee Yih Jia Food and Empress served at today's tea break after our speeches.Miss Cheng Li Hui asked about food safety of novel foods. We will ensure that only novel foods that are safe for consumption are introduced in Singapore. Last year, SFA implemented a new regulatory framework to require companies to seek its approval and undergo a scientific pre-market assessment before placing novel foods in the market. This framework facilitates the sale of alternative proteins in Singapore while ensuring their safety. Companies, such as local start-up Shiok Meats, who is looking to produce cell-cultured shrimp, will be able to benefit from this framework.To support the assessment of novel food, SFA will establish an international expert working group to provide scientific advice on food safety.Beyond food supply, we must not also forget our fundamental mission, that is to ensure that the food we eat is safe. SFA takes a serious approach towards upholding high food safety and hygiene standards. Since its formation, SFA has conducted more than 5,200 inspections in 2019 and taken more than 1,600 enforcement actions against errant operators.SFA will be introducing new measures to safeguard food safety. Premises which pose higher food safety risks, such as caterers and central kitchens, will be required to install closed-circuit television cameras. This enables them to monitor food safety performance and provide evidence in the event of food safety allegations.Enhanced measures will also be targeted at businesses that cater to vulnerable groups. Food businesses catering to preschools, kindergartens and nursing homes will be required to maintain food retention samples, which will facilitate investigations during food-borne outbreaks.From 2021, SFA will also introduce a single unified framework to license and recognise all food establishments. SFA will award a longer licence duration and a higher recognition to food establishments which uphold high food safety and hygiene standards. This way, SFA can re-prioritise resources to focus on checks to ensure compliance with food safety requirements.Mr Louis Ng asked about the introduction of a Good Samaritan Food Donation Act.MEWR is currently working on a legislation to enhance our food safety regime. As part of this, we are looking to introduce a legislation to facilitate food donation.Any legislation will need to strike a balance between facilitating food donation and ensuring food safety. We will be happy to work with Mr Louis Ng.Mr Chairman, let me conclude my last section of my speech by touching on the role of all Singaporeans in taking climate action. As the Government, we are providing leadership in tackling climate change. We do this by enhancing our climate pledge under the Paris Agreement and working with the industry to guide their transformation to a low-carbon economy. While the Government can lead on sustainability, the people must champion its cause.For instance, Singaporeans can make conscious climate-friendly choices in our daily essentials, such as food. Locally-produced food is of high quality, incurs less carbon miles, lasts longer and tastes good. By eating local, Singaporeans are making an environmentally sustainable choice. In the process, we support our farmers by choosing food that is grown in Singapore.Since 2017, SFA has partnered Singapore Agro-Food Enterprises Federation (SAFEF) to organise farmers' markets to raise awareness of local produce. Last month, I unveiled a new logo which Singapore farmers can soon use to help Singaporeans identify local produce.The community can also support local production by participating in community farming projects. For example, nearly 80% of NParks' Community in Bloom gardens grow edibles.There is also potential for companies and the community to engage in commercial urban farming that involves the community. Since the launch of the pilot rooftop farm, Citiponics in Ang Mo Kio, interest from the public – as Er Dr Lee Bee Wah mentioned just now – has increased towards urban farming in community spaces. We will provide more opportunities for urban rooftop farming. In the coming months, SFA will tender 16 rooftop spaces on HDB multi-storey car parks across the island, totalling over 30,000 sqm.As we grow our agri-sector, let us get involved in growing food in our own backyards.Now, let us talk about electrical appliances. Take refrigerators. They are amongst the top three highest energy-consuming household appliances today. However, many households continue to purchase 1 to 2 ticks refrigerators, partly due to the higher upfrontcosts of energy-efficient models, without considering the savings from electricity consumption over the long term. Similarly, showering takes up a significant proportion of water consumption, yet many households are choosing the less water-efficient fittings.To help households living in 1- to 3-room HDB flats invest in energy and water-efficient models, the Government will introduce a $24.8 million Climate-Friendly Household Package. These households will receive a once-off $150 voucher to purchase refrigerator models approved by NEA that have 3 ticks and above. Not only will this help fight climate change, households can benefit from electricitycost savings of up to $60 annually.We will also extend the \"Switch and Save – use LED\" programme launched in 2018 to all 3-room HDB flats. In addition, we will give all 1 to 3-room HDB households a $50 voucher to offset thecost of changing their shower fittings to more water-efficient 3-tick models.If all eligible households make the switch, we can collectively reduce emissions equivalent to taking around 12,600 cars off the road and save up to 400 million gallons of water annually.Next, let me focus on the ground-up efforts of our youths and citizens to address climate change.I commend our youths who are channelling their passions into positive change for the environment. During the Year of Climate Action in 2018, more than two climate-related activities per day were conducted, and youths played a big part in them. Recently, a group of 50 youths participated in the Environmental Track of the Youth Action Challenge organised by MCCY, submitting projects ranging from waste reduction to green technologies.We work together with these youths to deliver some of these ideas into reality. To empower our youths with knowledge and experience on sustainability, my Ministry is working with MOE and the National Youth Council (NYC). We want to introduce more sustainability programmes in schools and community facilities. Even Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) @ Coney will be designed to be a eco-experience for our youths to learn and enjoy.The Government will work with schools to introduce initiatives which will integrate green infrastructure, sustainability programmes and curriculum design to inculcate positive environmental values in our youths, like ones done in Mee Toh School.Another group of Singaporeans whose efforts I would like to recognise are those that are willing to share their experiences and ideas on sustainability.Last year, my Ministry convened our first Citizens' Workgroup on recycling, where 48 participants joined us on a month-long journey of co-creation. We will be setting up two more Citizens' Workgroups this year, focusing on more issues that Singaporeans care about.One Workgroup will start the conversation on how we can increase demand for local produce. I invite interested members of the public to visit our website at foodstory.sg to find out more about the Workgroup and sign up for it. Another Workgroup on reducing the excessive use of disposables will also be set up.As we have done with the recycling workgroup, we will carefully consider and work with these workgroups to realise some of their recommendations.It is our aspiration for Singapore as a nation to practise sustainable development and put sustainability at the centre of the way we live, work and play.At Budget, the Deputy Prime Minister spoke about the Ministry of National Development's (MND) Green Towns Programme, which injects sustainability into the infrastructure of HDB towns. Beyond the look and feel of housing estates, MEWR will introduce initiatives that will encourage Singaporeans to live and breathe sustainability. Let me elaborate.We have come far in the last 20 years since the development of Punggol as Singapore's first Eco Town. We have a vision to transform all HDB towns into Eco Towns.First, as we rejuvenate neighbourhoods, we will create more sustainable community touchpoints. We will build sustainable hawker centres that strive towards zero waste. Second, we will introduce community-based programmes that foster sustainability initiatives on the ground. Third, we will develop indicators for towns to track their progress and benchmark against national sustainability targets in carbon, energy, water and recycling.This will drive home the message that the effort of each and every Singaporean counts.I am happy that Tampines, Choa Chu Kang and Nee Soon Towns are coming on board to become Singapore's Eco Towns. Let me share some initial efforts.In Tampines, we are piloting new sustainability projects which can be replicated in other towns. The first project, \"Sustainability @ Tampines Park\", will be Singapore's first community-based circular eco-system for food production. Residents from 12 HDB blocks will be segregating food waste generated in their homes, to be fed to black soldier fly larvae. The larvae will produce fertiliser for a new vertical vegetable farm, and the larvae will be fed to tilapia cultivated in the Tampines Park pond. Not only will this project reduce food waste, it will simultaneously strengthen the community's food resilience.The second project in a different part of Tampines is the introduction of \"Eco Boards\". Eco Boards are low-energy digital boards that provide block-level information on water and energy use to residents. Together with Singapore Power and Temasek, we plan to build Eco Boards in several sites across Tampines Town. These Eco Boards will enhance the residents' awareness of their resource usage and illustrate the impact of green infrastructure such as solar panels.More details on the three Eco Towns will be announced over the coming months. I believe that the success of these Eco Towns will inspire other towns to begin their own journey of transformation towards sustainability.To build our sustainable Singapore together with Singaporeans, Deputy Prime Minister announced at Budget the establishment of a Singapore Eco Fund. Mr Mohamed Irshad and Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked for details of this fund.We are happy to announce that the $50 million Singapore Eco Fund will be made available later this year to the people, private and public sector, to support the co-creation of a sustainable Singapore. We welcome project proposals which involve the community and can deliver measurable impacts on our sustainability goals. My Ministry will also set up an SG Eco Office to co-ordinate sustainability projects across Singapore.3.15 pmMr Chairman, let me conclude. When we started our journey as a nation, our founding fathers gave us a vision of being the cleanest and greenest city in Southeast Asia. Even for this, we were inspired to do it together. Mr Lee Kuan Yew said in 1968 at the launch of the inaugural \"Keep Singapore Clean\" campaign, \"For only a people with high social and educational standards can maintain a clean and green city\". And he went on to say, \"Only a people proud of their community performance, feeling for the well-being of their fellow citizens, can keep up high personal and public standards of hygiene.\"We are now on our journey towards a sustainable and climate friendly Singapore. It is a journey that we can only make together.Prime Minister, at a tree-planting event in 2014, said, \"But we also have to do more than just plant trees; we also have to make the whole of the environment sustainable, friendly to people, and also for Singaporeans to be friendly to the environment\".It is for this reason that the Government will place sustainability at the core of everything we do. However, only by living and practising sustainability together can we mitigate the impacts of climate change and secure the resources needed to take Singapore into the future. Let us all play our part and work together, as one people, to ensure that Singapore remains a liveable home for our future generations.Mr Chairman, I will now hand over to Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor to address other strategies that will make Singapore a clean, sustainable and liveable home. [Applause.]The Senior Minister of State for Health and the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan): Mr Chairman, as Minister Masagos said earlier, we each have a duty to take climate action and safeguard Singapore for our future generations.This was why we designated 2019 as Singapore's Year Towards Zero Waste – to mobilise every Singaporean to do their part towards a Zero Waste nation and a circular economy. To Mr Chen Show Mao's question, it has been a busy and successful year. We engaged more than 670,000 Singaporeans and together with our 3P (People, Public and Private) partners, organised almost 2,000 Zero Waste programmes and activities. We supported ground-up initiatives through the \"Towards Zero Waste Grant\" and launched the \"Say YES to Waste Less\" campaign. All these efforts helped to instil in Singaporeans the 3Rs of Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.We also made tangible steps to lay the foundation for Singapore's transition to a circular economy. We charted out Singapore's inaugural Zero Waste Masterplan and set ourselves an ambitious target to reduce the amount of waste sent to Semakau Landfill by 30% by 2030.We can close our resource loops, just as we have done for our Water Story. In fact, we already recycle 99% of\tour\tferrous\tmetal\twaste and\tconstruction\tand demolition waste. As shared in Budget 2020, we are also making good progress turning incineration ash into construction material we proudly call NEWSand. We will begin trials to test potential NEWSand materials in road construction along Tanah Merah Coast Road later this year. Going forward, NEA will launch a Request for Information by mid-2020 for a commercial-scale facility to produce NEWSand.Achieving our Zero Waste vision is a whole-of-nation effort. Last year, we convened our first ever Citizens' Workgroup to co-create solutions to #RecycleRight. One follow-up project is the redesigning of the blue recycling bin to be more user-friendly. Their ideas include a transparent panel on the bin body, eye-level labels with #RecycleRight information and tailored deposit holes. MEWR and NEA will support the Workgroup members to fine-tune and trial their prototype. Ms Joan Pereira may also be pleased to know that NEA has already successfully trialled the use of bigger recycling bins, which are collected by side-loader trucks. These\twill\tbe\tprogressively\tdeployed across Singapore by end-2022.As Mr Daniel Goh highlighted, grassroots efforts are also\timportant\tin\tencouraging\thouseholds\tto #RecycleRight. Our Public Waste Collectors work with the grassroots to organise Cash-for-Trash programmes regularly at convenient locations. NEA is also considering a pilot \"recycling bin contamination rate\" competition involving several Residents' Networks.The private sector has also come on board. F&N Foods partnered NEA in the \"Recycle N Save\" pilot. Eleven Reverse Vending Machines have been rolled out and we will deploy 39 more by mid-2020. I am encouraged by the positive response with over two million containers collected since the launch last October. We will continue to refine the pilot.Mr Dennis Tan and Mr Louis Ng spoke about reducing disposables through a ban or a charge. We believe that we should take a pragmatic approach and find an inclusive solution that works for Singapore and Singaporeans, taking into account our local context. For example, degradable bags provide little benefits in Singapore as we incinerate all our household waste. On a life cycle basis, single-use paper and degradable bags also consume large amount of resources like water and land. Hence, instead of pursuing a substitution strategy, we should focus on inculcating the right values. Singaporeans' actions could then be motivated by a consciousness to safeguard the environment.This is why, in the spirit of Singapore Together, NEA will convene a Citizens' Workgroup later this year to address the excessive consumption of all disposables, including Styrofoam and single-use bags. We welcome citizens to deliberate the idea of a nation-wide charge for\tsingle-use bags as well as other measures, such as campaigns and education. We will take the Workgroup's recommendations seriously and work with participants to implement them where feasible. I invite Singaporeans to register for the Workgroup later this month.Among the supermarkets, FairPrice has taken the lead with their plastic bag charge trial last year, complemented with educational efforts. The trial has shown promising results, with majority of FairPrice's customers receptive towards a plastic bag charge. I commend FairPrice for its leadership and welcome this decision to expand the trial to 25 outlets for one year. I am\theartened that Prime has also implemented a plastic bag charge in four of their outlets. I call on other supermarkets and retailers to also pilot this and urge Singaporeans to support these efforts.My Ministry is taking the lead to introduce enabling regulations to transit to a circular economy. Last September, we passed the Resource Sustainability Act to address three priority waste streams – packaging waste, e-waste, and food waste.Packaging waste makes up a third of the total domestic waste disposed of in Singapore. The amount disposed of will only grow as Singaporeans embrace new trends in online shopping and food delivery. We need to find ways to manage packaging waste more sustainably.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Mr Mohamed Irshad asked for our plans on this. This year, we will introduce regulations to mandate the reporting of packaging data and development of 3R plans by producers of packaged products, as well as retailers and supermarkets. This will make companies more aware of their packaging use and encourage them to optimise it, thereby minimising waste and also reducing businesscosts. Obligated companies will start collecting the data from 1 July this year, for submission to NEA early next year.As this is the first time we are implementing such a reporting requirement, NEA is partnering the Singapore Manufacturing Federation on a\tjoint capability development programme that will support companies in fulfilling their new obligations. Companies will be offered workshops and training courses to familiarise themselves with the reporting framework. Companies can also exchange best practices in sustainable packaging waste management and prepare themselves for the upcoming Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework.Under the EPR framework, producers are responsible for collecting and recycling their product packaging. We are bringing forward the EPR for packaging waste by implementing it in phases. In\tthe first phase, we will build upon the reporting framework and the Reverse Vending Machine trials to implement a Deposit Refund Scheme (DRS) for beverage containers by 2022.In a typical DRS, producers pay for the system to take back used beverage containers. Consumers get a refund when returning empty beverage containers at designated return points. Countries like Norway and Germany have implemented a DRS and achieved high recycling rates of over 80% for beverage containers. We are studying international best practices and will conduct industry consultations and a Request for Information for the DRS later this year.The DRS is also an idea proposed by the Citizens' Workgroup on #RecycleRight. Workgroup members will partner NEA to work through the DRS implementation, such as co-designing surveys to optimise outcomes of the DRS. Together with our industry stakeholders and Singaporeans, we will design a DRS suitable for Singapore.The DRS will aggregate post-consumer plastic waste, such as PET beverage bottles. This will supply a steady feedstock to drive demand for local recycling capabilities. With your permission, Mr Chairman, may I display some slides, please.The Chairman: Yes, please. [Slides were shown to hon Members.]Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan: We have been working closely with our economic agencies to\tactively engage interested companies to set up mechanical recycling plants for post-consumer plastic waste here. PET bottles and the like can then be processed locally into plastic pellets, which can in turn be\tused to make new products. We will announce details when ready.But not all plastic waste is suitable for mechanical recycling, for example, contaminated plastic bags. To treat these, we are also pursuing chemical recycling solutions. Chemical recycling can potentially convert these plastics into higher-value products, like pyrolysis oil, which is a potential feedstock for Singapore's petrochemical sector. If successful, this will move us closer to both our goals of being a Zero Waste nation and a Low-Carbon economy.We hope that this will become – get ready for this – \"NEWOil\", and strengthen our resource resilience, just as we have done with NEWater and aim to do so with NEWSand. We are working with EDB and industry partners to look into establishing a pilot chemical recycling plant that will contribute to and help anchor the chemical recycling value chain in Singapore within the next few years.Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Mr Mohamed Irshad asked about our progress to address e-waste, which is our second priority waste stream.NEA has started registering producers under the e-waste EPR framework, which will take effect next year. Producers have also recently begun collecting data on the\tamount of regulated electrical and electronic products supplied in Singapore, for submission to NEA early next year.NEA will launch a tender this month to appoint the Producer Responsibility Scheme (PRS) operator, a key stakeholder in the e-waste EPR framework. NEA is now pre-qualifying organisations for the tender, and aims to appoint the PRS operator by the second half of this year. This will give the operator sufficient lead time to establish its collection and treatment network and organise public outreach programmes.Similar to packaging waste, the e-waste EPR framework will finance and drive local e-waste recycling capabilities. TES-B, a new lithium-ion battery recycling facility will be completed in the coming months. EWR2 and SMC Industrial are also planning to build two recycling facilities dedicated to large household appliances, ICT equipment and batteries. They will be completed by mid-2020 and mid-2022 respectively. Together, the three new facilities will be able to process more than 50,000 tonnes of e-waste per year when fully operational. With these additions, Singapore will be ready to treat our e-waste collected under the EPR system.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Mohamed Irshad spoke about food waste, another major waste stream with high generation tonnage and low recycling rates.Last year, I announced that from 2024, owners and occupiers of commercial and industrial premises that generate large amounts of food waste will be required to segregate their food waste for treatment. Owners and occupiers of new buildings will also be required to treat their food waste on-site.These requirements will apply to shopping malls and hotels with more than 3,000 sqm of F&B area, including function area for hotels; as well as industrial premises that either house at least one food manufacturer of more than 750 sqm, or are above 20,000 sqm and have more than 20 food tenants.3.30 pmNEA is including these thresholds in the Code of Practice on Environmental Health, to ensure that from 2021 onwards, obligated owners and operators will allocate space for on-site food waste treatment systems in their development plans.To support premises to prepare for the mandatory requirements, NEA is developing a guidebook on best practices and case studies on the implementation of food waste segregation and treatment.Segregating food waste from the other waste streams will make it easier to maintain cleanliness in premises.Cleanliness and hygiene is a first line of defence against evolving public health threats. Seventeen years ago, when we were battling SARS, we instituted regular \"spring cleaning\" of our hawker centres to safeguard environmental hygiene and curb the spread of such diseases.Last month, in response to COVID-19, we launched the SG Clean campaign to rally Singaporeans to keep Singapore clean and to safeguard public health. At\tthe individual level, we call on Singaporeans to practise good personal hygiene and social responsibility through the \"7 Habits of Good Public Hygiene\". Concurrently, NEA is working with Government agencies and business premises to step up public hygiene standards. We want our hawker centres, public transport nodes, schools, retail malls, shops and various premises to receive the \"SG Clean\" quality mark.SG Clean seeks to turn the current crisis into an opportunity, by uplifting the standards of public hygiene and sustaining them. It is to be a whole-of-nation movement to instill a national \"keep clean culture\" for the long term, beyond the battle with COVID-19. We will need to shift from the current top-down compliance-focused approach towards a more collective approach, where all stakeholders take accountability and ownership to proactively achieve high standards of cleanliness in Singapore.The SG Clean effort is needed even if our regular surveys indicate that we are mostly doing well in keeping Singapore clean. In the last two years, we witnessed multiple incidents of gastroenteritis linked to contaminated environments, including at pre-schools and nursing homes. These incidents underscore the importance of environmental hygiene. So last August, even before COVID-19, NEA convened an interdisciplinary technical committee to develop a set of national baseline cleaning standards for premises. NEA is currently consulting with stakeholders to further develop sector-specific standards.To catalyse this transformation, we will amend the Environmental Public Health Act (EPHA) to introduce mandatory baseline cleaning standards later this year. These standards will comprise a regime for proactive and thorough cleaning, as well as disinfection, at prescribed frequencies. This will include the oft-neglected \"back of house\" areas such as bin centres.As part of the EPHA amendment, we will place greater accountability on premises managers for the cleanliness of their premises. They will be required to appoint a Designated Person to assist them to develop an environmental sanitation programme and advise on measures to remedy any lapses. We will be mindful to calibrate the standards to minimise compliancecosts.We will work with sectoral leads to progressively implement the new requirements from 2021, starting with higher-risk premises with high footfall and immuno-vulnerable occupants, such as childcare centres, schools, eldercare facilities and hawker centres.We do not know how long COVID-19 will last. We are entering a new situation, a new normal, where enhanced personal hygiene habits and social responsibility will have to be an integral part of our lives. Let us work together to make SG Clean our new way of life.SG Clean and our fight against dengue go hand-in-hand, as we remove stagnant water and keep our environment clean and litter-free. In 2019, there were nearly 16,000 reported dengue cases, with 20 deaths. This year, the Aedes mosquito population remains high, and indeed we are concerned about the increasing number of cases of the less common dengue virus serotype 3, or DENV-3. We must be careful as Singapore has not seen a DENV-3 outbreak in almost three decades, and population immunity to DENV-3 is low.Let me assure Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms Sylvia Lim that we are addressing these risks through a multi-pronged dengue management approach. First, NEA conducts comprehensive surveillance of the mosquito population via more than 64,000 Gravitraps nation-wide. This allows NEA to target its operations early and prioritise areas with higher mosquito population. Second, NEA leverages technology, such as using drones to aid inspections or apply insecticide in hard-to-reach places. Third, NEA shares data on dengue clusters and areas with higher mosquito population publicly on its website and myENV App. This facilitates early community intervention and pre-emptive measures.Let me emphasise here, that whatever new approaches we take cannot substitute the need for public vigilance and collective action to suppress mosquito breeding and prevent dengue. I strongly urge all Singaporeans, young and old, to take proactive measures to protect yourselves and your loved ones. Actively practise the \"7 Habits of Good Public Hygiene\" and \"Mozzie Wipe-out\".I would like to thank all our cleaners who have worked extra hard to keep SG Clean. We can all show our support for the cleaners by playing our part too. At hawker centres for instance, we can do so by eating from our trays and returning them, as Mr Alex Yam has rightly pointed out. We have achieved a tray return rate of 62% on average at our Productive Hawker Centres, double that of other hawker centres. This was achieved through a\tsuite of efforts such as implementing salient reminders, providing strategically-located Automated Tray Return Stations, and ensuring that trays are clean and dry for use. We will continue working with stakeholders to promote tray return at all our hawker centres. This will also alleviate the cleaners’ workload so\tthat they can focus their efforts on maintaining general cleanliness.As custodians of our much loved hawker culture, we will continue to work closely with stakeholders to ensure that affordable and good hawker food can continue to be a mainstay in Singapore.Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Amrin Amin, Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap spoke about new hawker centres and the SEHCs. Of the 20 new centres we are planning to build by 2027, seven are already in operation. Ten more are currently in the design or construction stage, and we are working out details for the remaining three. The next centres to open are Bukit Canberra Hawker Centre in end-2020, and Fernvale Hawker Centre and Market in early 2021. NEA will tender out these two centres to socially-conscious enterprise. These operators provide active management to build up clientele and vibrancy at hawker centres, such as through curating food mix and programming.Currently, there are seven hawker centres under the Socially-Conscious Enterprise Hawker Centre, or SEHC, model, and most have done well. Nonetheless, we will constantly review and improve the model. When evaluating tender proposals for operating future hawker centres, NEA will give greater emphasis to footfall, vibrancy, and sustaining the hawker trade. We will also assess operators' performance in maintaining high footfall and stall occupancy. In the past year, NEA introduced the Staggered Rent Scheme, and extended the Productive Hawker Centre grant to stallholders at SEHCs. NEA also reviewed the contracts between operators and stallholders to better safeguard stallholders' welfare, and required operators to conduct regular Hawkers’ Feedback Groups.To Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap's\tquestion about stallholders’\tfeedback, these are usually on what more operators can do to improve vibrancy, attract footfall and help stallholders with their operations. All in, these measures serve to ensure that the SEHC model continues to benefit residents, and support stallholders at the same time.I assure our hawkers that we will always look out for them. As part of the Stabilisation and Support Package announced during Budget 2020, we will provide a one-month rental waiver, with a minimum sum of\t$200,\tto\tall\tstallholders\tin\thawker\tcentres managed by NEA or NEA-appointed operators.\tThis will help them\twith their\toperatingcosts\tduring the current COVID-19 situation. Stallholders will receive 50% rental waiver this month, and 25% in April and May. This will\tbenefit\tabout\t14,000 cooked food\tand market stallholders. About one third of the stallholders, whose monthly rentals are below $200, will in fact enjoy more than one month of rental waiver. We share Ms Joan Pereira's concern – we will monitor the situation and are prepared to provide further assistance if required.Nonetheless, I am heartened to see the resilience of our stallholders. At Chinatown Complex Market, the stallholders are working hard to achieve the SG Clean quality mark for their stalls, and are even organising a promotion event this weekend. So do show them your support! It is okay to, you know, gain a few calories or inches.Last year, we also facilitated the formation of two Workgroups, which Mr Liang Eng Hwa spoke about, to co-create solutions to key issues facing our hawker trade and culture. I am pleased to note that even before the Workgroups submit their recommendations, we are already adopting some of their ideas.For instance, we have already implemented one of their ideas, the Hawkers' Development Programme (HDP). Classes start next month, and I encourage aspiring hawkers to apply.The Workgroup also suggested fostering a strong hawkers’ network and facilitating hawker-to-hawker sharing. Following the positive feedback for the inaugural Hawkers' Seminar held last year, we will support the Federation of Merchants’ Associations, Singapore to organise this Hawkers' Seminar as an annual event.Another Workgroup idea that we are\tworking on is a series of hawker awards to recognise hawkers’ efforts and achievements. We will share details on the awards and nomination process later.A key challenge that the Workgroup raised was the physically demanding nature of the hawker trade. We had launched the Hawkers' Productivity Grant (HPG) in 2017 to help stallholders adopt kitchen automation equipment. Close to $1.5 million has been disbursed to 526 cooked food stallholders. You might have tried the ayam penyet by Mr Abdul Rahman Bin Suradi. He tapped on the HPG to buy a multi-function food processor to prepare his chilli sauce. Now he needs only a quarter of the time and can ensure the correct consistency and quality. With the time saved, he can serve more customers.To help more hawkers improve their productivity, I am pleased to announce that we have taken in the Workgroup's suggestion to enhance the HPG. From 9 March 2020, we will expand the HPG to market stalls, and the scope of supportable items will be broadened beyond kitchen automation to include service innovation, such as queue management systems. We will also extend the HPG, which would have ended in October this year, to March 2023. Mr Chairman, in Mandarin please.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Hawkers are the heart and soul of our hawker centres. To help our stallholders tide over the COVID-19 situation, we will provide one-month of rental waiver, with the minimum sum of $200, to all stallholders in our hawker centres. Stallholders will receive 50% rental waiver this month and 25% in April and May.We have also listened to feedback from hawkers and will be enhancing the Hawkers' Productivity Grant to help more hawkers adopt productivity solutions. From the 9 March 2020, market stallholders will also be able to apply for the HPG, and a broader range of items will be supported, such as queue management systems. We will also extend the HPG to March 2023.(In English): Today, as is fast becoming customary of MEWR'sCOS, besides Minister's treat of a meatless satay and gyoza from Impossible Meat, I have arranged for some hawker delights to be served in the Members' Room. I urge all of you to tuck into these drool-worthy eats, if you have not done so.The kentang and sardine epok are from Kalsom Kuih Muih Curry Puff at Yishun Park Hawker Centre, lovingly handmade by Mdm Kalsom Kamis and Mr Zaidi Bin Zainal and are simply sedap! I know because I have tried it.3.45 pmAlso, try the exquisite cakes from The Headless Baker at Ghim Moh Hawker Centre – you might just fall head over heels for them! This is a new Incubation Stall run by Ms Amber Pong, who used to work as a pastry chef in Melbourne.Building a sustainable and climate-resilient Singapore for ourselves and for future generations is not only about addressing our challenges. As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr Mohamed Irshad and Mr Desmond Choo pointed out, it also brings economic opportunities for our companies and creates good jobs for Singaporeans.Local companies can leverage sustainability as a competitive advantage to export their innovative solutions and grow beyond our shores. An example is Orinno Technology Pte Ltd, one of NEA’s key partners in Project Wolbachia. NEA and Orinno have jointly developed innovative Wolbachia-Aedes solutions, and have even filed five patents! Not only has Orinno played an important role in advancing Singapore’s public health research, they have also gone on to export these solutions, such as to Thailand and Australia.Through upskilling and technology adoption, more than 45,000 people will benefit from higher value jobs in the environmental services, water and agri-food sectors over the next five to 10 years.Let me share about Mr Soh Han Hwee, who started 17 years ago as a Site Supervisor in cleaning services company Horsburgh. He believes in constantly upskilling oneself and has completed over 20 courses from\tcleaning, work-at-height, productivity management, risk management, Leadership & People Management courses, and the list goes on! Through his training, Mr Soh has been promoted to become an Operations Manager and now has more than a hundred people under his supervision.As we move towards a risk-calibrated co-regulation approach,\twe\twill\tsupport\tcompanies\tand\tentire industries to build up their competencies and create higher value jobs. Just as how the Water Efficiency Management Plan created Water Efficiency Manager roles in companies, strengthening our environmental sanitation and food hygiene will also create demand for higher-skilled roles, such as the cross-functional Environmental Control Officers or ECOs, and Food Hygiene Officers (FHOs).NEA will be enhancing the competencies of ECOs who are currently engaged at construction sites as advisers of good environmental practices. Enhanced vocational training will benefit approximately 2,600 ECOs by equipping them with up-to-date skills to better plan and implement a full array of measures including vector control, environmental sanitation and waste management.We\twill\tfurther\treview\tthe\tECO\tscheme\tas\ta competency-based vocation and broaden their\twork areas beyond construction sites to more premises types, like shopping malls. In time, ECOs will be valued as certified experts who are well-versed in multiple aspects of environmental management. They are leaders who can drive and raise environmental standards of the premises\tthey\toversee.\tIn some\tways,\tECOs\tare almost as important as CEOs!As part of SFA’s regular review of the Food Hygiene Officer course curriculum, SFA will enhance the training framework for FHOs. FHOs can look forward to a holistic food safety education to better equip them as food safety guardians at their workplaces.SFA will also be developing a new Advanced FHO framework, which would allow FHOs to upgrade and progress to Advanced FHOs. Advanced FHOs will be trained to develop and implement internationally recognised Food Safety Management Systems. Over the next 10 years, 9,000 new and existing FHOs and 400 Advanced FHOs will be trained.Courses under these training frameworks can also be offered as certifiable modules to students in food-related programmes. This enhances their relevant skills and increase their job opportunities.There will also be exciting jobs created in new growth areas such as the high-tech agri-food sector.SFA has been working with government agencies, Institutes of Higher Learning and the industry to build competency within the agri-food workforce. This includes developing training programmes at various levels, which will be rolled out at the right time to meet industry needs without creating oversupply.In the last two years, SFA has collaborated with Temasek and Republic Polytechnics to implement two SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programmes leading to diplomas in Aquaculture and Urban Agricultural Technology respectively. These programmes equip fresh ITE graduates with relevant skillsets to start their careers as Aqua or Agri Technicians.Thus far, there are seven ITE graduates in the two Earn and Learn programmes. Ms Germaine Chong is one of them. As an Aquaculture Technician at Apollo Aquaculture, Germaine benefited from\tstructured on-the-job training, mentorship and technical training. Recognising Germaine’s good work performance, Apollo Aquaculture has even offered to sponsor her for the full diploma.This year, SFA will be working with NTU to launch a new Food Science and Technology post-grad certificate programme. This programme will cover contemporary topics on urban agri-technology, such as post-harvest of agriculture produce and novel food such as microalgae and insects. I believe technology will remove the \"yuck\" factor and bring the \"yum\" factor in.On the Environmental Services side, we have launched the first ever NEA-Industry Scholarship Programme. We will partner the industry to award 20 scholarships to ITE and Polytechnic students in related fields, such as engineering, environmental technology and sciences. The scholarship provides scholars with financial support during their studies and attractive salary and clear progression pathways upon graduation.In the recycling industry, the three upcoming e-waste recycling facilities are expected to add\tanother 430 jobs. In tandem with the implementation of the Zero Waste Masterplan and Resource Sustainability Act, industry transformation will create more career opportunities requiring engineering, science and environmental management expertise. I therefore want to assure aspiring entrants into these fields that the jobs are exciting, pay well, leverage on new technology, and most importantly, are Planet-saving!Mr Chairman, I want to end off my speech on an optimistic note. Even as the existential challenge of climate change looms over us, opportunities abound. We have to seize them and find creative solutions to make the most out of them. Just take my blouse as an example. Its designer JJ Chuan named it MusicCloth. Ms Chuan told me that 56 million kg of plastic had been used to make cassette tapes since they were first introduced in 1963. I am not sure how many Members here remember or know what a cassette tape looks like. She gives them a new lease of life by upcycling discarded cassette tapes, weaving them into the \"fabric\" for new products such as this evening bag, and also this prototype houndstooth matching blouse.By planning ahead and working together as SG United, you can turn the challenges from climate change into opportunities for our companies to innovate and internationalise and create better jobs for Singaporeans. That is really turning trash into treasure. [Applause.]The Chairman: Clarifications? Mr Louis Ng.Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: Thank you, Sir. I do not have much to show except this shirt which I have worn for five years. And that is the best to go towards zero waste. I have two clarifications.One is on the carbon tax. We agree that the climate issue, it is an existential threat and that is why we introduced the carbon tax. But the issue here is that we are going to take too long to review it, which is we have committed to increase it by 2030. So, to tackle this emergency, can we look into reducing the time frame, which means can we at least look into increasing it by 2025, which is five years' time instead of 10 years?Secondly, with regard to the public disclosure. I am just wondering whether MEWR has done any studies or review into the studies that show that there is a positive effect of public disclosure. The example I raised in my cut is the German Institute of Economic Research that showed that this type of company level disclosure will result in a 17% reduction in carbon emission. So, what is holding us back from doing something that will help to reduce emissions here in Singapore?Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: The carbon tax is only one of many measures that we have put in to make sure that we nudge our industry, our transport, our buildings towards meeting our targets. But there is also a reason behind that, like I mentioned in the early part of my speech. It is to make sure that we too will do our part in the United Nations' framework for climate change.Our emission is barely 0.11% of the world's – about 50 mega tonnes. UK – five hundred mega tonnes, thereabout. China – 10 giga tonnes. So, even if we were to halve or eliminate our total GHG, we would not have moved the needle. It is all these other big emitters that must do their part to make sure that we can save our planet.But the framework is one where everybody must do their best within the constraints of what they can do. So, our solutions fit ourselves and we believe that with what we have put forth, including the time frame, we will be able to manage to achieve our GHG commitments including the new ones that Senior Minister Teo announced, to reduce it by half in 2050 and to being carbon neutral in the second half of the century.It is important that in the context of which we look at commitments, it is also to look at the constraints and the context of each country's make-up of how they produce these GHG in the first place.There was a second question on public disclosure. I do not know how we can draw clear causality between the rules around disclosure and the outcomes around reducing GHG. Surely, there are many other things that have nudged or transform these companies to achieve reduction in the GHG emissions. I am quite sure one of them is the UNFCCC framework itself because it has set a mood in the whole world, that countries, companies, had better moved, had better transformed, whether or not you are going to be transparent or otherwise, because that is where the world is going.And out of responsibility or even out of marketability of the products, that is how people will move. Whether they will move faster with disclosure or not, I am not so sure. I will say though that our SGX has already made the right moves to require companies to do sustainable reporting and they have to comply or they have to explain, if they do not make sustainability efforts.The Chairman: Ms Sylvia Lim.Ms Sylvia Lim: Chairman, I have a clarification concerning Project Wolbachia, the mosquito study. The first is that, I think it has gone through a few phases now. And from what I understand to date, it has not been deployed in any dengue clusters. My clarification first is, is there any rationale for not deploying it in dengue clusters thus far?The second clarification is, earlier Minister Masagos mentioned that there is an intention to expand the project to larger areas. Does he foresee, for example, in the coming months that this will also involve dengue clusters in the expanded project?Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: We are extremely careful in deploying this technology because we are introducing something that is, while natural – Wolbachia is naturally occurring in mosquitoes – we are doing it artificially. We are injecting huge numbers into the community. So, apart from the effectiveness of the technology, we are also mindful, as Mr Louis Ng had mentioned, of the disamenities that residents may suffer from suddenly having millions and millions of mosquitoes in their neighbourhood. So, there is some socialisation that has to take place.I am happy that where it has been tried out, in Yishun and Tampines, the outcomes have been good – 90% suppression. But the disamenities and the complaints have persisted. When I do my house visits, residents will still say they see a lot of mosquitoes now. Then, when I explain to them it is the Project Wolbachia. They say, \"Yes, I know. What shall do?\" I tell them, \"Do whatever you need to do – spray, hit – do whatever you need to do to make sure you do not suffer from these dis-amenities\".4.00 pmTherefore, we need time. I think we need time to make sure that as we expand the areas where we deploy the Wolbachia, that the people are also used to this.But here is the good news. We hope that, as we suppress the mosquito population, we can then introduce fewer male mosquitoes over time. But that is still a hope; that is still something we need to try and we need to validate. Project Wolbachia will take some time but it is going to be a very important tool that we can use in times when climate change brings higher temperatures, which in turn, encourages mosquito breeding. We need to have an arsenal of weapons to deploy.In the meantime, we must still do what we must do, which is to suppress the breeding of these mosquitoes within our homes. Everyone must do their part. This is not a magic bullet. The Project Wolbachia will not be a magic bullet. We still need to ensure the breeding in our homes is well controlled.The Chairman: Mr Seah Kian Peng.Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade): For Project Wolbachia, I was one of the first few constituencies. The residents liked it quite a lot. So, if you want to bring it back, I volunteer my constituency again.My clarification for the Minister revolves around food resilience. As I mentioned earlier, our plan to have 30% of our food supplies coming from within local produce by 2030 is an ambitious plan. But as I said, if there is a way to bring this to achieve it earlier, I think we should really go all out to to do it.But we also know that local produce inevitably comes at a highercost and therefore, we should also think of ways to help local producers to be better accepted by the consumers here.I would like to ask the Minister, I know we are doing quite a lot, but what else can we do, because you cannot run away from the fact that local produce is morecostly. Many of my business associates in this industry, we want them to succeed but I think we need to do a lot more to get the consumers to accept it. And I am sure Government can think of other ways to promote their products and for consumers to lend their support, not just by words, but by action.Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: I thank the Member for the supplementary question, especially on how do we support our local farmers and local production. There are many ways. If you are all familiar with the four Ps of marketing, it is not just about pricing. Pricing is just one point at which we can push products faster. Sometimes, pricing, if it is too cheap, like salt becomes a useless product. It is not something people value.And therefore, we will be helping our local producers to learn how to market their product better. For example, Red Mart is now marketing the local produce, selling through the electronic means, through Internet. It is achieving some measure of success because they know how to market it properly. It is not just about shelf display and so forth.Apart from that, we also have achieved some form of scale. This is particularly important for our fish industry. The technologies we have put into our fish industry are quitecostly. And if they only do it in Singapore, they will not be able to achieve the scale per unit. Therefore, we are happy that they have now expanded beyond Singapore shores. For example, Apollo has got concessions now in Brunei, Barramundi Asia too, as well as some other of our fish farms. And this will enable them to achieve and spread thecost of their early investments over a larger unit, a larger production. That too will help us to achieve the pricing points that would be attractive to Singaporeans.But beyond that, I think there is also a segment of our buyers who are looking for sustainable products. The number may not be big but over time, the young will demand that products that they buy are sustainable ones. Therefore, it is important for our local producers to learn how to produce these sustainably.The Chairman: Mr Pritam Singh.Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Thank you, Sir, just following up some points I made in my Budget debate speech about the recycling and a charge on plastic bags so as to reduce our waste signature. On that note, I acknowledge the points made by Senior Minister of State on studies done and workgroups to be formed to look into that prospect.My question relates to point I made in the Budget debate speech about waste in general and the amount of waste that we dispose. I understand last year, MEWR had a target to reduce the amount of waste that is sent to Pulau Semakau by 30%. What is the progress of that? How is that coming along, by 2030, I believe was the timeline?On that note, what is the Minister's assessment of Pulau Semakau as a continued area where we dispose our waste? Do we not need to reduce our waste signature even further?Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan: We launched the Zero Waste Masterplan last year and one of the key goal, of course, is to reduce the amount of waste that we bring to Semakau by 30% by 2030. The Zero Waste Masterplan lays out in details the initiatives that we will be implementing or are already doing in order to achieve this goal. One of the these would be on the three key waste streams – e-waste, packaging waste and food waste. The Resource Sustainability Act has been passed and it is to enable some of these measures to be put in place. So, extended producer responsibility will be starting next year for e-waste. That will help to reduce the amount of waste, including those that may be trashed to Semakau.Packaging waste is another one and we are actually bringing part of this EPR framework forward with the Deposit Returns Scheme that we will be implementing in 2022. If we implement the Deposit Return Scheme, post-consumer plastics, like PET bottles and so on, will then not have to be trashed if we can create a demand for this as feedstock.Then, other ideas, which I have mentioned in my speech, about chemical recycling – again to recycle the contaminated plastics, turn them into \"NEWOil\", for instance.All these measures will help us to reduce the amount of waste that will go to Semakau landfill. We want to save Semakau. We want to extend the lifespan of Semakau landfill for as long as possible.The other one, of course, is NEWSand where we are already looking into having a commercial facility for NEWSand to be used as construction materials. Road pavements – we are going to do a study later on, on its effectiveness and impact. If you can use incineration bottom ash, that means instead of filling it up, putting in Semakau landfill, if you can actually use incineration bottom ash as construction material, NEWSand, then you will also reduce the amount of waste that you have to landfill in Semakau.The Chairman: Mr Gan Thiam Poh.Mr Gan Thiam Poh: My question is on solar installation at the reservoirs. Was acost-benefit study done? I was wondering about the recovery of the capital expenditure or capex, compared with so-called the conventional energy. Of course, I am in support of this project to use solar energy, but I just want to understand whether, in the long run, is it something worthwhile to do.Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Solar energycosts have gone down all over the world, not just in Singapore. I just came back from Saudi and they are deploying solar panel fields – these are so huge and I am so envious that they have so much land. So, not only do they have energy under the ground, they now have energy above the ground. They have so much energy that they are not using it at all most of the time. They just want to do it because there is the land that they have and they think this is the way to go to be green.For us, the only large amount of space that is not used would be the reservoirs. On thecost of solar panels alone, it is now low enough for us to benefit from the economic gains.The Chairman: I can hear all the delicious food calling us. So, would Er Dr Lee Bee Wah do us a favour and withdraw the amendment?Er Dr Lee Bee Wah: I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister, Senior Minister of State and the team in MEWR for working very hard for thisCOS. I am very happy to hear of all the job opportunities. Definitely, I will be the first few who will apply for the SG Eco Fund as I want to make sure that our rooftop, high-tech community farm is up and running by this year. With that, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $1,728,100,500 for Head L ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $1,243,512,600 for Head L ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.The Chairman: Order. I propose to take a break now.Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the House.Mr Speaker: Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.30 pm.Sitting accordingly suspendedat 4.12 pm until 4.30 pm.Sitting resumed at 4.30 pm[Deputy Speaker (Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]"

        "Content": "Debate resumed.6.58 pmMs Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to first thank Deputy Prime Minister Heng and his MOF team for the hard work they had put in with a generous Budget that aims to address the storms in sight, whilst at the same time prepare us for the tectonic shifts ahead.Last year, I asked for mental health to be a whole-of-Government priority. It was unintentionally prescient then to see this in action now with the multi-Ministry task force set up to tackle the COVID-19 outbreak. The psychology of our people became more than a priority for the Government to understand so as to manage the panic buying, hoarding and shunning of healthcare workers – all coping mechanisms to deal with underlying fear and anxiety. Research studies have found that these deficiencies of community resilience can be caused by poor mental health, leading affected communities to be less cohesive, adaptive and more vulnerable to shocks and disruption.The near-term uncertainties and long-term structural shifts that Deputy Prime Minister highlighted should, therefore, alarm us to the need to prioritise mental health. I was very encouraged in the recent month by Prime Minister Lee, Deputy Prime Minister and several Ministers rallying Singaporeans around the need to strengthen social and psychological resilience, both critical pillars of our Total Defence strategy.So, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will understand why I was disappointed that mental health was not mentioned at all by Deputy Prime Minister during his speech, despite mentioning \"resilience\" four times. The ability to adapt to significant and adverse changes we call resilience is not happenstance – it is enabled by good mental health.As a nation, we clearly struggle with mental health. There has been a steady increase in the lifetime prevalence of mental illness in Singapore over two decades – 10% or more when it was first tracked in 1998 and 2007, to 12% in 2010 and now 13.9%. To put into perspective, which I also did last year to limited success apparently, the prevalence for diabetes in Singapore was 8.6% in 1992, peaked at 11.3% in 2010 and has seen remarkable improvements since the \"war on diabetes\", decreasing to 8.8% today. As one doctor shared with me: \"Until the Government starts taking the stand that mental health is as important as diabetes, there is a limit to what individual organisations can accomplish\".Mr Deputy Speaker, despite two decades of increasing prevalence of mental illness in our society, the Government still seems to be struggling to do more for the mental well-being of our people. In fact, the Health Minister has previously shared in this House that we only spent 3% of our healthcare operating expenditure in FY2017 on mental health compared to 11% for diabetes. Under our FY2020 expenditure estimates for healthcare, there are only three expenditure items targeted to support mental health. In comparison, many other developed countries such as New Zealand, Scotland, Iceland, Finland, Canada, Norway and Australia have identified mental health as a budget priority with significant resources dedicated to support mental well-being in their societies.Sir, at this juncture, Members may think that I am recycling my speech from last year but let me assure you that I am not, although that would be clearly so much easier for this part-time Nominated Member of Parliament with no institutional support! Last year, I shared the mental health struggles of those near and dear to me including my own close shave with depression more than a decade ago. Perhaps, these sharings did not seem substantive or representative enough to persuade our policy-makers. So, earlier this year, my amazing team of volunteers and I decided to launch the first-ever public consultation on mental health in Singapore. Rudimentary it may be – given less-than-limited resources – we were surprised and heartened by the more than 400 responses received from Singaporeans, 70% with lived experiences whilst the rest from care-givers and mental healthcare professionals! Many of these personal stories are heart wrenching – we even ended up doing \"case work\" with some! But since personal stories did not seem to move policy-makers last year, I decided I will focus this year’s speech on where we are falling short in the specific areas of affordability, accessibility and quality in mental healthcare and concrete urgent actions that I hope Deputy Prime Minister and relevant Ministers will take.First, on affordability. It broke my heart when I read one respondent \"having to starve to afford therapy\". At least 10 respondents shared they stopped seeking help because of financial struggles. Sixty-six percent of the respondents shared that mental healthcarecosts were high, with more than half of them being users of public healthcare services. How is it that our world-class healthcare system has denied so many people the mental healthcare that they need?Sir, you may not know that as much as a seven-time difference still exists between MediSave and MediShield Life limits imposed on treatment for physical health versus mental health conditions. A respondent shared, I quote, \"I paid over $10,000 total [purely] for inpatient care after deduction of MediSave and MediShield Life for the past two years\", even after \"opt[ing] for class B2 and C wards to savecosts\". It is time to remove this entrenched stigma by bringing these limits to parity for both mental and physical health conditions. MediSave should also be allowed for services at Government or quasi-Government-funded community organisations because how can we have a community health approach if it is not?Next, on accessibility. There are around 248 psychiatrists and 473 psychologists practising in Singapore, or 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.3 psychologists per 100,000 population which may explain why the overall median waiting time for new subsidised appointments across the public hospitals is 27 days to see a psychiatrist and 28 days to see a psychologist . Seventy-one respondents also shared that lack of relevant and trusted information was a prohibitive factor against seeking help.I was, however, encouraged by the 23 respondents who commended CHAT, which is Community Health Assessment Team, a public healthcare initiative by IMH located within the community. CHAT provides a unique combination of: one, free and confidential mental health check service that guarantees data will not be entered into the public health system; and two, care navigation that includes subsidised referral for public mental healthcare services if required. Unfortunately, CHAT currently only serves the youth segment but I hope this model could be adapted and expanded to support all ages.And now, quality. First, let me commend our mental healthcare professionals for their hard work, many of whom I know personally. More than 50 respondents, however, indicated grave dissatisfaction with the quality of public mental healthcare. Thirty-six percent explicitly mentioned lack of empathy in the professionals they interacted with and the dismal environment of psychiatric wards in our public hospitals.Mr Deputy Speaker, we are not saying all mental healthcare professionals are incompetent or without heart. In fact, many respondents indicated that the poor quality could be attributed to the excessive workload which strains both professionals and the system. As one respondent puts it, \"While the Government is ostensibly pushing campaigns that aim to reduce the stigma of seeking help for mental health issues, there is a lack of parallel funding for actual mental health services, such as the hiring of more counsellors and mental health professionals\".Twenty-six respondents cited the importance of feedback on treatment to improve their health outcomes. One respondent lamented, I quote, \"They never asked me for feedback. I would like them to ask for feedback.\" Continuous improvements happen when we empower clients and patients by recognising that they are part of their care process too.In the same vein, strategic plans such as the Community Mental Health Masterplan must involve extensive public consultation, especially those with lived experiences and their care-givers, while ensuring that aggregated public health data continues to be shared transparently. This helps to improve local research on mental health issues and better coordinate efforts in supporting mental well-being of our communities.The recent launch of a multi-agency consultation effort on youth mental well-being is a wonderful start. Yet, to truly facilitate a SG Together response, we need such conversations to move beyond only the youth, especially since the average age of subsidised patients for the different mental health conditions was between 40 to 50 years old in the last three years. Incidentally, in the spirit of SG Together, my team of volunteers created a simple website called SGMentalHealth.com, so that we can also share what we found from the public consultation.We also received responses on other policies, ranging from confidentiality, support in schools and workplaces to issues surrounding mental healthcare for marginalised or vulnerable communities like the differently-abled, LGBTQ+ and migrant workers. I will highlight these issues separately with the relevant Ministries during theCOSdebates.These fundamental issues in affordability, accessibility and quality of our mental healthcare must be addressed by the Government with a fierce urgency or we risk another decade of increasing prevalence in mental illness, despite the well-meaning awareness and anti-stigma efforts.Mr Deputy Speaker, this brings me to my last point on the paradigm shifts we need to make to move beyond mental healthcare to total well-being for every Singaporean.The structural and policy issues discussed earlier aim to close the treatment gap. But what if we could reduce the number of people getting ill in the first place? What if we paradigm-shift mental health as a public health issue? What would our policies for mental health promotion and illness prevention look like? Would we then start to ask what are the causes of rising levels of mental distress in childhood that saw calls made by five- to nine-year-olds to SOS Singapore jumped by 500% over a three-year period? And the spike in the number of teenage suicides in 2018? Might we not insist on conducting mental health screening for our students every year, like physical health and dental checks? Will we begin to study the role of social justice, family and schools in mental health so that we can address the underlying social determinants? Will we also start to understand the impact of public policies on the psychological capital of our people and endeavour to create a psychological safety climate for innovation and well-being to flourish that truly binds Singapore Together?Another paradigm shift we urgently need to make, Sir, is the long overdue recognition that mental health is a critical part of total well-being. Mental health is a continuum. It is not \"I'm mentally sick, or I'm not\". It’s not \"I'm over it, or I'm still in it\". It's not \"I got it, I will never get it\". We may think that mental health challenges only affect certain people, or some segments of our society. But if we just pause and have an honest conversation with ourselves, we will realise that we are navigating along this continuum at any point in time through our life. Because who has not suffered a loss? Who has not had a major life transition? Who has not felt overwhelmed with responsibility for another? Who has not been marginalised in some way? Who has not been made to feel like a failure?None of us in this House can pretend that we have not struggled with a dearth of mental health at some point in our lives. Changing this paradigm of thought will help us think about how we can strengthen the support available within our communities. When asked what helped them most in their mental health journey, many respondents shared the importance of community support.When we translate these paradigm shifts into strategies across the system, we may then see why it makes sense to expand physical health education to total health education in schools to include mental health. Why workplace health and safety must be beyond physical health and safety, which I am very happy to note that the Tripartite Oversight Committee on Workplace Health and Safety – of which I declare I am a member of – has started doing good work in this area with employers and employees. Why there is merit in making it explicitly clear to employers that the Sick Leave entitlement for each worker can also be used for mental health treatment and recovery and that mental health insurance is not a luxury but a necessity for employers to support their employees' total health.Strong mental health support at schools and workplace directly impacts how we show up for our roles in our family and community – which contributes to how we support our children as parents, our elderly parents as care-givers and how we build strong ties and connections with our friends, our colleagues and our neighbours.This returns us to the importance of resilience as individuals and communities, Mr Deputy Speaker. The mental well-being of our people – man or woman, young or old, rich or poor, working or jobless, straight or gay – forms the bedrock of our psychological resilience and social cohesion, which may be the only sure way to secure our future in Advancing as One Singapore against the headwinds ahead.Already, a late 2019 study found that stress-related illnessescost Singapore's economy $3.2 billion annually. So, I would like to earnestly ask the Deputy Prime Minister, what needs to happen for mental health to be a national and budget priority? Do we have to wait for one in four Singaporeans with mental health conditions, like the current global average, for us to take urgent action? Do we need to see more parents lose their children to suicide or more young people in distress for mental health to be a public health priority? Can we afford negative growth in productivity and innovation before realising how mental well-being is intricately tied to human performance?Mr Deputy Speaker, this is likely my last Budget speech. So, I wish to conclude by imploring the Government to take action now to make quality mental healthcare accessible and affordable for all Singaporeans, to bring this on par to the world class public healthcare system for all that we are proud of. This is surely the loudest anti-stigma signal to send!In addition, I challenge the Government to boldly take a strategic and preventive approach to deliver mental well-being and total health to our people as it has done spectacularly with economic well-being, so that we can bring and build the social resilience and psychological capital to thrive as a nation and flourish as human beings.I also urge all Members of Parliament in this House to support the mental health needs of their constituents so as to create resilient communities as part of this SG Together effort.To Singaporeans, I invite you to remember that wherever you are on the mental health continuum is not solely a matter of personal agency but also largely determined by your social support structures, or lack of. So, if you are struggling right now, I hope you know it is not a personal failing. We are all responsible for each other's mental well-being, including the Government and institutions. You have, in fact, shown us what true resilience is by fiercely living each day with less-than-adequate state support in mental healthcare whilst constantly dealing with structural stigma and discriminative behaviours.Mr Deputy Speaker, I look forward to the Deputy Prime Minister's response to the hopes of the 400 Singaporeans and many hundreds more who have reached out to me over the years, including my tireless team of volunteers. They have bravely come forward to share their struggles. Their generosity and courage keep me going on this crusade for change. I share the same hope as this respondent who said, “I hope that the day comes soon where no one has to feel alone in their mental health journey.” [Applause.]7.16 pmMiss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Budget. Twenty-twenty started with a lot of uncertainty. The US-China trade war still not settled and technology continued to disrupt businesses and threaten jobs. Against this backdrop, COVID-19 came along and slammed our economy and our way of life and threatened to bring us into a recession.To help us overcome these challenges, Deputy Prime Minister Heng and his team have put together a very generous Budget 2020 with a wide-ranging package of measures to support and sustain businesses, workers and families in the short term. At the same time, it allows to focus on the longer term to transform our economy and re-skill our workers for our long term sustainability and success.This is a good reminder that the reason why we have been able to put together such a package is because of the surplus generated and reserves accumulated over the years by our previous generations. Successive generations of Government and Singaporeans have worked hand in hand to get to where we are today. Our Pioneers led the way and the Merdeka Generation worked hard and transformed our country. A wealthier Government today is showing their appreciation with generous packages and top-ups. Therefore, I am especially happy that our seniors have been given special attention in this Budget: more Silver Support Scheme beneficiaries, higher payouts and dollar-for-dollar matching when their families top up their CPF accounts.One of the values that have got us this far is resilience, as a nation and as individuals.This year's Tampines East Edusave Merits Bursary (EMB) ceremonies coincided with Total Defence Day. I took the opportunity to remind the audience that Total Defence is more than just military deterrence. Home team agencies and institutions such as our hospitals play a critical role too. The COVID-19 crisis has shown us once again that defending Singapore against threats often requires a whole of Government approach. It involves coordination between multiple ministries and agencies, with an eye always on the bigger picture.Our response to the COVID-19 emergency has been admired by many. The researchers of a Harvard University study said, \"Singapore set gold standard for COVID-19 detection around the world”. This entire response and operations that the taskforce has mounted is not something we should take for granted.On behalf of my residents, may I say \"thank you\" to all involved in dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak.What is heartening is that during my house visits, I met several residents ho told me “we have to play our part against the virus”. Some of them, I learnt, sanitised the lifts daily on their own accord and their neighbours were not aware. They also realised that the cleaners were busy cleaning common touch points and so swept their own corridors.At EMB ceremonies I noticed some of the children were having stage fright. I encouraged parents to share with their children their own fears and insecurities. Let our children know that everyone has fears and we must try and overcome them. I told the audience, I do not like public speaking. I still do not. But I am really glad I did not let that stop me from doing my work now. I love my work.Likewise, parents can share meaningful lessons in their lives so their children get to understand difficult situations and decisions. They can learn to think through some of the challenges and build resilience. These lessons often come in everyday scenarios.In Tampines, we have a free bowling programme during the school holidays. We deliberately mix students of different races and schools during the game. One of the girls went home crying because she was afraid and uncomfortable mixing with students she did not know. Her mum took leave to bring her for the next session and shared with her that she will not be able to choose her own Secondary school classmates or work colleagues in future. She told her to try and adapt and she will be there to support her. We watched the girl as she finally enjoyed the company of her lane mates and even forgot about our presence. She just needed the morale booster.We love and protect our children. Give them the very best we can, put them first. But the most important value we can teach is to instill strength, the tenacity to try things, be adventurous in thoughts if not actions.Sir, our people strive to be the best they can be – acquiring knowledge and skills, possessing determination and drive, working hard to get ahead. Striving is a fulfilling process but it is not easy one. I am heartened that this Budget signals that the Government is standing with all Singaporeans in their determination to build a better future for themselves and their children. And coupled with resilience, we will all emerge stronger and better together.Resilience is only one face of the Singapore Spirit. The other equally important face embodies the graciousness and kindness that many Singaporeans are displaying every day.I witnessed that first-hand in Tampines earlier this month. Just two days after the raising of the DORSCON alert to Orange, and amidst reports of panic buying at supermarkets islandwide, our volunteers continued their monthly food donation drive to help needy residents. Not only did more volunteers turned up to help, we also saw more residents, including new faces, approaching us to donate food items. Some thoughtfully added bottles of hand soap in their donations.During the same period, I visited a family in Tampines who has a member who was infected. The rest of the family members were quarantined at home. We delivered some daily necessities to the family. I also took the opportunity to visit the other residents in the block. While I sensed some residents had uneasiness and questions about the virus outbreak, I was especially heartened when I witnessed neighbours rallying around the infected family. One neighbour offered to buy the family their daily necessities while another offered to deliver meals.My heart swelled with pride as I witnessed our residents putting aside their concerns to step forward to help fellow residents in need.Sir, before I end, I do have one suggestion for the Finance Minister to consider. Budget 2020 has many schemes and enhancements. Some people such as our seniors and smaller enterprises may be overwhelmed by all the information. May I urge the Government to step up on engagements and communications to targeted groups like families, companies, workers, especially seniors so that they can better understand and benefit from all the available schemes.I am optimistic that this Budget will resonate with Singaporeans and set us on a firm footing for our continuous nation-building journey. So, let us persist and continue to strive together for our people and our country. SG United. On this note, Sir, I support this Budget."

        "Sitting Date": "25-3-2020",
        "Section Name": "Second Reading Bills",
        "MPs Speaking": "[Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast), Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan, Dr Lam Pin Min, Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon), Mr Deputy Speaker, Mr Deputy Speaker, Dr Lam Pin Min, Dr Lam Pin Min, Mr Deputy Speaker, The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min)]",
        "Content": "Order for Second Reading read.6.26 pmThe Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Transport): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Transport, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"The Bill amends the Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention) Act to: (a) enable Singapore to give effect to the 2018 amendments to the Maritime Labour Convention; and, (b) provide a statutory basis for an approved financial security provider who has paid a seafarer for certain liabilities owed by a shipowner to the seafarer, to acquire the seafarer's rights against the shipowner in respect of the liabilities.Let me highlight the key provisions of the Bill.First, clauses 3 to 5 amend the Act to enhance employment protection for seafarers in captivity. Should a seafarer be held captive on or off a ship as a result of an act of piracy and armed robbery against the ship, the seafarer's employment agreement continues to have effect during the period of captivity. This is regardless of whether the date fixed for the expiry of the seafarer's employment agreement has passed or either party to the seafarer's employment agreement has given notice to suspend or terminate it.Further, a captive seafarer's wages and entitlements must continue to be paid during the period of captivity, until the day the seafarer is released and duly repatriated, or until the seafarer's death while in captivity. The seafarer's employer is also obligated to repatriate the seafarer upon release from captivity.Besides enhancing employment protection for seafarers in captivity, we are making another amendment to facilitate the acquisition of a seafarer's rights by an approved financial security provider which provides insurance or other financial security required under the Act to shipowners. Clause 6 facilitates the transfer to and vesting in the financial security provider of a seafarer's rights against a shipowner as a result of any liability arising from the shipowner's obligation to repatriate the seafarer. For example, the liability to pay the seafarer's wages and entitlements. It amends the Act to provide a statutory basis for the financial security provider to acquire such rights if the provider has paid the seafarer under a contract of insurance or other financial security for such liability.To conclude, the provisions in this Bill will help protect seafarers' welfare and enhance Singapore's international reputation as a responsible maritime nation. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.Question proposed.6.29 pmMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill, which seeks to enhance protection for seafarers who have been held captive on or off a ship as result of an act of piracy or armed robbery against the ship. My comments today on the Bill are from an employment perspective.While the amendments to the Employment Act last year are no doubt commendable, the EA does not cover seafarers. Seafarers' employment rights and obligations are governed by the Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention) Act which is to be amended this time round. I have spoken to my sisters and brothers at the Singapore Maritime Officers' Union and the Singapore Organisation of Seamen and am pleased to share that they stand in full support of this deck of amendments.Broadly speaking, the amendments to the Bill provide that where seafarers are held captive due to acts of piracy or armed robbery against the ship, the following will apply, during the period of captivity: first, the seafarer's employment agreement continues to have effect during the period of captivity; second, the seafarer's wages and other entitlements under their employment contracts or collective agreements must continue to be paid; and third, the seafarer will be entitled to repatriation upon his or her release.The amendments to the Bill are timely in view of the recent sea robbery incidents. In December 2019, The Straits Times reported that pirates launched two attacks on separate vessels in the Singapore Strait within two hours of each other.In the first incident, three perpetrators had entered the engine room and one of them was armed with a knife. Two of the crew members were subsequently discovered to be tied up. In the second incident, six intruders had attacked the ship and tied another two crew members up in the engine room.CNA also reported that sea robbery incidents in the Singapore Strait had hit a four-year high in 2019, with a grand total of 31 such incidents, which is in stark contrast to the 17 reported incidents from 2016 to 2018.Collectively, these incidents show how seafarers are increasingly vulnerable to acts of piracy or armed robbery on board the ship as well as the risks they undertake to perform their jobs as well. Accordingly, it is necessary that the laws be enhanced to offer protection to seafarers in terms of continuity of employment, payment of wages, benefits and repatriation entitlements during such periods of captivity. That is the least we can do to alleviate the financial and emotional burdens of seafarers held captive at sea through no fault of theirs.While I am fully supportive of the amendments to the Bill, I have the following questions for the Senior Minister of State.First, is there a reason for the sudden spike in sea robbery incidents in 2019 as compared to the previous years? I understand it is attributable in part to lack of enforcement measures. What would be the other reasons and would the Senior Minister of State be able to provide more details on that?Second, does the Senior Minister of State foresee that the rising number of sea robbery incidents is a cause for concern, especially in view of Singapore's prominence as a global maritime hub? If so, would the Senior Minister of State be able to share some of the enforcement measures that are to be implemented to combat such crimes such that seafarers and vessels sailing through Singapore waters are assured of their safety. It is crucial that the measures implemented are effective as there would be knock-on effects on Singapore's position as a financial hub as well as the livelihood of seafarers.Third, what is presently being done and what more can be done to help families and relatives of seafarers who have been held captive at sea? I am sure they experience a deep sense of helplessness and despair in such situations.Sir, clarifications notwithstanding, I stand in support of this Bill.6.33 pmMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): Sir, I stand in support of the Bill. In 2016, we amended our laws in accordance with the Maritime Labour Convention or MLC, to improve protections for crew abandoned by their shipowners by mandating shipowners' procuring of financial security. This ensures that seafarers are fairly compensated in the event of death or long-term disability due to occupational injury, illness or hazard.In view of last year's spate of sea robberies in our waters, which has reached a four-year high, it is commendable that we are seeking amendments to this Act to duly compensate seafarers in the event of an abduction in an armed robbery or piracy incident. I am supportive of this move to bolster the labour protection for seafarers, a vulnerable group of workers who are exceptionally excluded from the Employment Act.To the proposed amendments, I would like to raise five clarifications.My first clarification is on the reporting of abductions. Given that captive seafarers must continue to be paid wages and other entitlements during their captivity, errant shipowners may make false claims of the whereabouts of the abducted seafarer in the event of an armed robbery or piracy incident.Can the Senior Minister of State clarify what measures will the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore or MPA put in place to ensure all cases of crew abductions are truthfully and accurately reported? What punitive measures does the MPA intend to take against errant shipowners?My second clarification is on the period of salary payment. The new section 20(7A) provides that the seafarer's wages and other entitlements must continue to be paid during the seafarer's period of captivity until the seafarer's release and repatriation, or the date of the seafarer's death. Further, the effect of the new section 12A is that the seafarer's employment agreement continues to have effect during the captivity period regardless of the date of expiry of the agreement or any termination notice.It is possible that a seafarer's life, safety and whereabouts will be unknown while in captivity. It appears from the Bill that in the instance that a seafarer is held captive for an extended period and it cannot be confirmed if he or she is dead, the shipowners will be required to continue paying wages and other entitlements indefinitely.While I am supportive of the protective rationale of these amendments, shipowners have a strong incentive to avoid making these payments for an abducted seafarer.How will the MPA ensure that shipowners will continue to make these payments? In the event that shipowners are unable to make payment, what funds are available to cover the shortfall in wages and entitlements to be paid to the abducted seafarer?My third point is on terrorism-linked kidnappings. Clauses 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill seek to protect the seafarer in the event of an abduction related to an armed robbery or piracy incident.We have seen kidnap-for-ransom incidents perpetrated by terrorist organisations in the region. Notably, the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf terrorist group has carried out a number of kidnappings of seafarers in regional waters. Most recently, in June 2019, 10 gunmen from Abu Sayyaf kidnapped 10 fishermen off the coast of Sabah, Malaysia.Can the Senior Minister of State clarify if these amendments will cover abductions linked to terrorism? In other words, will the abducted seafarer be remitted his due wages and entitlements in the case of terrorism?The fourth issue I would like to raise is a proposal on post-release support programmes for abducted seafarers. A study titled \"The Long-term Impact of Maritime Piracy on Seafarers' Behavioral Health and Work Decisions\" found that one in four former hostages showed symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Given that victims of other types of trauma, such as assault and sexual harassment, can tap on numerous avenues for counselling and support, the same should be made available for abducted seafarers, even if such victims are rarer.Will the Senior Minister of State consider introducing post-release support programmes for abducted seafarers?My fifth and final point is on protections for Singaporean seafarers on non-Singapore flagged ships. Section 3(1) of the Act provides that various parts of the Act will cover Singapore ships wherever they may be and non-Singapore flagged ships in Singapore. The Act does not seem to apply to Singaporean seafarers on non-Singapore flagged ships. Can the Senior Minister of State clarify if the protections accorded by these amendments will be extended to Singaporean seafarers on non-Singapore flagged ships if they are abducted in a piracy incident outside of Singapore's territorial waters? If not, what protections and recourse are available to them?Sir, with more than 1,000 ships passing through the Singapore Strait every day and more than 4,400 Singapore-flagged ships on our registry, this amendment will ensure that abducted seafarers and their families will be adequately compensated. This Bill will align Singapore with the 2018 amendments to the Maritime Labour Convention or MLC. As such, I stand in support of the Bill.Mr Deputy Speaker: Senior Minister of State Lam Pin Min.6.38 pmDr Lam Pin Min: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Louis Ng and Mr Patrick Tay for their comments and support of the Bill. Let me address the points they have raised.To address Mr Louis Ng's query on MPA's measures against errant shipowners who wilfully misreport abductions, there are existing measures to address this. Currently, all Singapore-registered shipowners are required to put in place procedures for reporting shipboard security incidents, including incidents of abduction, under Chapter XI-2 of the Merchant Shipping (Safety Convention) Regulations.To ensure timely reporting of abductions, MPA has issued shipping circulars to the shipping community to remind shipowners and ship-masters to send reports of any attacks or attempted attacks on board their ships immediately to the Rescue Coordination Centre for the area and to MPA. A shipowner who knowingly or recklessly makes a false report of a shipboard security incident commits an offence under section 194 of the Merchant Shipping Act. Such an offence is punishable with a fine not exceeding $10,000, or an imprisonment term not exceeding two years, or both.Mr Ng also asked if shipowners will be required to continue paying for wages and other entitlements indefinitely for cases where the seafarer's whereabouts are unknown and the seafarer's death cannot be confirmed, and whether there would be a sunset clause built into the subsidiary legislation.The intent of the amendment is that the shipowner must continue to pay the wages of the captive seafarer until the seafarer is released from captivity and repatriated or until the death of the seafarer while in captivity. In circumstances where it is believed that the seafarer has died, a presumption of death certificate may be applied for through the court.Mr Ng also asked if the amendments will cover abductions related to terrorism, for example, kidnapping for ransom by a terrorist group. The Bill seeks to enable Singapore to implement the 2018 amendments to the Maritime Labour Convention, which require shipowners to continue to pay seafarers their due wages and entitlements in the event of an abduction in an \"armed robbery\" or \"piracy\" incident. Under international law, whether a specific terrorist act can fall within the definitions of \"armed robbery\" or \"piracy\" depends on the facts of the case.Shipowners may further take on additional insurance cover for terrorism, in which case, seafarers will be compensated their wages and entitlements in instances of abductions related to terrorism. Seafarers also have a right to terminate their contracts upon giving notice, which they could choose to exercise if the ships they are on will traverse or journey through high-risk areas.On Mr Ng's fourth point about post-release support programmes, we will bring that back and study the proposal.On his last query on whether Singaporeans on non-Singapore-flagged ships will be protected under this amendment, I am happy to update Mr Ng that actually, most other shipping companies also need to abide by the MLC, whether they operate Singapore-flagged ships or not. As many countries are MLC countries, Singaporeans who are working on non-Singapore-flagged ships should be covered under the 2018 amendments.Next, to address Mr Patrick Tay's query on reasons for the spike in piracy and armed robbery (PAR) incidents in the region in 2019 as compared to previous years, there could be several reasons for these incidents. The Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against ships in Asia or ReCAAP, cited crew members' lack of vigilance and highlighted the need for strong collaboration among the littoral states in information sharing and enforcement. The Minister for Defence mentioned in Parliament on 3 February this year that perpetrators are based and operate outside of Singapore territorial waters. Therefore, the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) is working closely with our neighbours to share information and collect intelligence to better tackle these threats, and to step up enforcement in the region. MPA is also encouraging the shipping community to be vigilant when travelling along the Singapore Strait.Mr Tay also asked what are the enforcement measures that are to be implemented. Should any suspicious vessel enter Singapore territorial waters, our maritime agencies will respond strongly to safeguard Singapore's security and take the necessary action against the perpetrators.For incidents outside our waters, we have to work with our neighbours to counter this transnational threat. As I have mentioned in myCOSspeech, the Malacca Straits Patrol (MSP), involving our military and the militaries of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, conduct air and sea patrols in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. This also involves regular information exchange and updating suspicious indicators to assist investigation efforts of sea robbery incidents. MINDEF has reached out to its counterparts in Malaysia and Indonesia to propose that the MSP initiative be extended to other areas in our surrounding waters. Discussions are on-going. RSN's Maritime Security Task Force (MSTF) will also be enhancing its capabilities to deal with maritime threats, including piracy and armed robbery.In addition, Singapore is part of a region-wide initiative called ReCAAP, which facilitates timely and accurate information sharing so that the respective littoral states and the shipping community can take prompt remedial actions.Mr Tay also asked what is presently being done and what more can be done to help families and relatives of seafarers who have been held captive at sea. The 2018 amendments will require shipowners of Singapore-registered ships to continue to honour the employment agreements of seafarers who have been taken captive by pirates or armed robbers regardless of whether the date fixed for the expiry of the seafarer's employment agreement has passed. Shipowners will be obliged to continue paying captive seafarers their wages and entitlements until the seafarers are released from captivity and repatriated, or until the seafarer's death, should the seafarer die while in captivity. This would allow the seafarer's next-of-kin to seek compensation from shipowners for wages during the period of captivity.Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill will improve seafarers' welfare and strengthen our standing as a responsible maritime nation. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.Question put, and agreed to.Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. – [Dr Lam Pin Min].Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.Mr Deputy Speaker: Leader of the House."

        "MPs Speaking": "[Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir), Mr Pritam Singh, Mr Speaker, Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol), Mr Speaker, The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat), Mr Heng Swee Keat, Mr Heng Swee Keat, Mr Heng Swee Keat, Mr Heng Swee Keat, Mr Heng Swee Keat, Mr Heng Swee Keat, Mr Heng Swee Keat, Mr Speaker, Mr Heng Swee Keat, Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)]",
        "Content": "Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [18 February 2020] [3rd Allotted Day],\"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021.\" – [Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance].Question again proposed.Mr Speaker: Mr Pritam Singh.11.10 amMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Mr Speaker,we are the tail end of this Government's term. From 2016, all the titles of each Budget emphasised \"unity\"–partnering for the future, moving forward together, together a better future, building a strong and united Singapore, and finally, this year, advancing as one Singapore.But unity in the context of a democracy, along with the 4G leadership seeking to engender a Singapore Together movement, must also encounter varied, diverse, edgy and even contradictory views in the effort to find common cause. This is to be encouraged not discouraged. It is that process of embracing diversity and accommodating political differences that give meaning to a democracy of deeds for the 21st century and not for a one-party parliament of decades past.Mr Speaker, Parliament is an august forum which is one manifestation of Singapore Together. My colleagues in the Workers' Party and I thank all Singaporeans for sharing their views and coming to us to bring up issues to Parliament over this term of government, particularly, those that Government Members of Parliament (MPs) cannot be expected to raise, not out of an inability of their own but because of the nature of politics and political contestation.WP MPs agree with the Government when we have to, disagree where we must, in the knowledge that we endeavour for the best outcomes for Singapore and for a unity of purpose when politics must take a backseat, like during this current COVID-19 outbreak.My speech will be divided into three parts. I will first speak of the geopolitical environment and the response of some businesses to the Budget announcements. Next, I will talk about our fiscal position, with some points on our revenue and expenditure position before finally concluding with my views on the enhanced SkillsFuture Credits and the climate change-related announcements.Sir, the Finance Minister's Budget speeches on the external environment and developments that affect Singapore's geopolitical developments over this term of government have been prescient, illuminating not just upon the challenges but imperatives ahead for Singapore. In his 2018 Budget speech, the Finance Minister outline three major shifts in the coming decade: the shift in global economic weight to Asia; the emergence of new technologies that will change the way we live, work and play; and finally, ageing. Themes which were repeated in the Minister's 2019 Budget speech as well.Sir, the last few years have witnessed tectonic geopolitical shifts. US Attorney General William Barr's speech at the Department of Justice earlier this month captured the mood of the times ahead, at least from Washington's perspective. In reminiscing about the days of the Cold War, Barr remarked, \"Russia wants to conquer the world. We can deal with that. China wants to own the world. That is going to be more challenging to deal with.\"American policy towards China is on a very different course and with a bifurcation of the world looking like an almost foregone conclusion, not just a technological decoupling, but with differences in values and norms at the heart of things. More so than before, shaky US-China relations are threatening to force invidious choices upon Singapore, choices which the political leadership not just within the PAP but all political parties and citizens in Singapore would have to negotiate with greater judiciousness and sensibility without compromising an absolute commitment and loyalty to Singapore.However, this circumspection does not just extend to the superpowers. We must also resist the urge to engage in gloating when our closest economic partners like Malaysia and competitors like Hong Kong negotiate their own unique political circumstances; circumstances which are historically apart, completely different and in many cases take place in a more complex and significantly larger country, many times our population size.My brief discussions after the Budget was announced with a few members of the various local Chambers of Commerce informed me that there has been a general acknowledgement of the relief provided by the Stabilisation and Support Package in the Budget. Separately, I understand Chamber Members are also continuing the work on longer term efforts at internationalisation and bringing businesses up to speed with new initiatives, particularly training and growth opportunities.Sir, one specific group of Singaporean businesses and individuals reached out to me in the aftermath of the Budget. They are our private hire bus companies and drivers who are bearing the brunt of cancelled trips and tours arising from the COVID-19 outbreak. These are the bus drivers who bring our residents to Malaysia for durian trips and even National Servicemen around Singapore for local tours or training.I understand that an industry briefing was held on the 21 February by the Singapore Tourism Board on a relief package for travel agents and tour operators. While the briefing was appreciated, private bus companies feel the Budget support package is not targeted enough, in view of the nature of their business.I thank Minister Josephine Teo for her speech during the course of the Budget debate, explaining the policy reasons why foreign worker levies were not reduced or waived. Nonetheless, I hope the Government reconsiders this and extends some support by way of a one-month or partial waiver of the levies for companies that have no choice but to hire foreign manpower, on the condition that these companies consciously seek to increase their local headcount, by way of job redesign going forward. Some conditional support and consideration for them in these difficult times, may provide greater impetus on all our companies overly reliant on foreign manpower today to make a greater effort to hire locals–including senior citizens, and even those on a part-time basis–tomorrow.Mr Speaker, I move on to the second part of my speech on fiscal prudence and sustainability, a subject which is a feature of practically every one of Deputy Prime Minister Heng's Budget speeches. One hard truth that we do not hear in this house, notwithstanding greater demands on expenditure, is that the current Government has had the privilege of far more budgetary elbow room, both political and fiscal, than any previous government in Singapore's history.Just think about it. After the inclusion of Temasek in the NIRC component of the Budget from 2016, monies for GST offset package can be set aside for the introduction of higher taxes for the next term of Government. Compared to 2015 when the NIRC component of the Government's revenue was about $9 billion dollars, today, the figure is almost double. Separately, the package to support the economy in light of COVID-19 was not funded from a draw on the reserves, unlike the support package during the Global Financial Crisis about a decade ago.Sir, when the Workers' Party made inquiries on the reserves over the course of a few Budgets in this term of Government, it was to explore and consider different approaches and prospects to improve the lives of our people, particularly the low and middle class. At the last Budget, Finance Minister provided a lengthy reply on why the dollar value of the reserves could not be disclosed. But the answer remains unsatisfactory, particularly when the same argument could apply to the overwhelming majority of other democratic societies, who nonetheless err on the side of fiscal scrutiny and accountability.At last year's Budget, I brought along a Business Times article that saw Singaporeans calling for a greater discussion on the reserves. These calls for greater transparency are not out of place and they will continue in years to come. They run in parallel with the Singapore Together spirit with Singaporeans taking ownership, exploring fiscal solutions, seeking to co-create not just today's Singapore but a sustainable and equitable tomorrow that future generations of Singaporeans will inherit.More specifically, in Finance Minister's 2018 speech, the prospect of borrowing by Statutory Boards and Government-owned companies to build infrastructure was first raised to help spread thecost of larger investments over many years. This prospect of borrowing was raised again by Finance Minister in his 2019 Budget speech where the Finance Minister confirmed that the Government is studying the option of using Government debt as part of the financing mix for long-term infrastructure projects.Mr Speaker, it has been two years since these plans on debt-financing were raised. Can the Government share more details on these plans, as this year's Budget does not communicate the results of the Government studies on the borrowing or debt-financing framework and their fiscal consequences on future Budgets?This year's Budget also saw the Finance Minister once again making reference to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, an initiative that seeks to ensure companies are taxed where substantive economic activities are performed. The Finance Minister first raised BEPS in his 2017 Budget speech. Then the House was informed that the Government was in consultation with businesses on scheme refinement and implementation of the relevant standards. What has been the results of these consultations from three years ago?BEPS was raised again in the Finance Minister's speech this year and the Minister shared that there are discussions to revise international tax rules and that Singapore was actively participating in them. However, reference to BEPS this year was in the context of a sub-point of another sentence, which warned there were uncertainties and downside risks to the Government's revenue position – a matter which should be of interest to all Singaporeans.I have a query with respect to BEPS. Before that, it is useful to recap the Government's argument on proposals by Singaporeans to raise taxes of higher income earners, who do enjoy the safety and security offered by Singapore. The concern was that high net-worth individuals would be able to structure and move their assets to avoid higher tax obligations.What is the impact of BEPS on this prospect and the Government's assessment of the impact of BEPS' developments on our tax policies? Is there an upside, nonetheless, by way of other taxes on the ultra-rich to maintain our progressive tax system? What are the best and worst case scenarios to the developments in BEPS on our revenue position?Mr Speaker, the Finance Minister's Budget speech confirmed that GST will not be going up next year. Notwithstanding the offsets announced, the GST is a regressive tax that will hit the low and middle income, retirees, seniors, particularly hard as they would have to manage their expenditures more frugally because offsets do not last forever, particularly for the middle class.At this year's Budget, the Finance Minister said that the Government put off the rise in GST after considering the state of the economy, but more critically, I quote, \"...after reviewing our revenue and expenditure projections\". Sir, when the Workers' Party objected to the rise in GST in 2018, amongst other things, it was on account of a lack of information about alternate revenue streams. The Finance Minister's position then was that one did not need to have information on everything to make a decision on anything.But from the Minister's speech this year and the announcement not to raise GST next year, it is obvious that the Government relies on revenue and expenditure projections to make these decisions.Would the Government make public these projections so that Singaporeans can critically evaluate the necessity of a GST hike? I believe this openness would contribute to a more substantive conversation and understanding of our fiscal trade-offs. This can only advance and mature conversations that take place in Singapore. Until this clarity is provided, the Workers' Party position has not changed. We cannot support a GST hike, especially since this is to be raised in advance and before the Government's projections have been put to this House.The third segment of my speech is a short one, Mr Speaker. I refer to the Government's call for special SkillsFuture Credit top-ups for Singaporeans between the ages of 40 and 60. The Workers' Party supports this move, but urges the Government to track the use of these credits for this age group to job and employability related outcomes closely. More generally, while SkillsFuture subsidised courses can range from, in the words of the Finance Minister, \"cooking to coding\", it does not bode well if taxpayers' money are expended on courses that are under-weighted with regard to real improvements of skills, job prospects and employability of our workers, in view of the workplace disruptions to come.We know from previous Parliamentary replies that there is an upper limit to certain entrepreneurial prospects in Singapore, such as the opening of cafes. An audit of the courses our people are taking up, particularly younger and middle-aged Singaporeans, must be reviewed every so often in consultation with inputs from the Industry Transformation Map (ITM) stakeholders, so as to evince the best outcomes possible for our workers in the medium term.Lastly, Mr Speaker, I expected some strong incentives or subsidies in this year's Budget on climate change outcomes, particularly in the aftermath of MEWR's efforts towards greater climate change awareness over the last few years, including designating one year, a year of climate action.To this end, I would urge the Government to move more decisively to incentivise changing behavioural norms to reduce the overuse of plastic bags. For example, a transitional subsidy amounting to $20 for households to subsidise the purchase of plastic bags at supermarkets could be considered as a bridge for Singaporeans before a charge is levied for every bag by all retailers.Mr Speaker, incentivising the reduced usage of plastic bags is not just about our over-consumption of plastic bags per se. It is also about the amount of waste we generate and dispose which usually ends up in a plastic bag that is thrown down our bin chutes. A plastic bag charges far from representing mere climate change symbolism. It is a clarion call to us all and to alter social norms to equally, if not more importantly, reduce the amount of waste we generate. This is a pressing issue as there are infrastructural constraints on the amount of space we have to dispose our incinerated waste on Pulau Semakau which is expected to be full by 2035 or thereabouts. That is only a mere 15 years from now.Correct as of Monday, there were 342,304 pledges on the MEWR website to fight climate change. There is a window to move more decisively and we should move fast.To conclude, Mr Speaker, the Finance Minister is correct to say that many Singaporeans are coming up with and acting on ideas to make Singapore a better place on their own initiative. For the first time in his Budget speech in this term of Government, the Minister has spoken about the democracy of deeds. But whatever deeds our people underwrite, they take place within the context of our democracy, a democracy where alternative views, criticisms and disagreements shape the outcomes that give meaning to the phrase one united people – united in a vision for better and more confident Singapore, no matter what our political beliefs.It is like that anthem that was referred to in this House, during the course of this Budget debate, \"You Will Never Walk Alone\". But how many of us know that it is not just the anthem of one club but others too, like Glasgow Celtic, Borussia Dortmund and many others.Sir, Singapore's diversity is its strength. As long as our people – youth, businesses, individuals – engage the issues of the day civilly in our democracy and treat their fellow Singaporeans and foreigners within our midst with dignity and empathy, and endeavour for a more caring society, the best years of Singapore – a Singapore for all – are ahead of us.Mr Speaker: Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.11.25 amMr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on an issue that I have raised before in previous Budget debates – the importance of fiscal sustainability and financial prudence.Sir, my friends often accuse me of being obsessed with numbers. I tell them it is an occupational hazard because I am a chartered accountant by training. But, I have found over the years in practice that numbers give us the most precise and clearest indication of one's financial position.Sir, this year's Budget Statement is no different. Overall, we estimate our position to be in deficit of $10.95 billion. Year on year, we hope for increases in our operating revenue amid very challenging global competition. For example, our tax collections can increase if our companies do well and pay more corporate taxes. At the same time, we also hope for more revenue from our Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC). Our NIRC only became possible because of the prudence and wise investment decisions made by our earlier generation of leaders. Against this backdrop, our estimated to the expenditure is expected to increase much larger because we need to fund our healthcare needs and infrastructure developments, like our MRT lines, to bring a better life for Singaporeans.Sir, talking about healthcare amenities, I have for the last many years, been asking for a polyclinic in my constituency of Potong Pasir. I even filed a Parliamentary Question (PQ) for that. [Laughter.]In my discussions with MOH, they informed me that there is no more space in Potong Pasir estate because it is all built up. That is true. But, MOH is building Kallang polyclinic, which is connected to Kwong Wai Shiu hospital. I see Dr Yaacob had a thumbs-up because that is in his Jalan Besar constituency. So, that is also good for Potong Pasir residents because that is one MRT station away.However, I think I found some space for MOH. The residents of Bidadari are moving in and I think there should be some space in Bidadari estate to build a polyclinic for our Potong Pasir residents. So, if you can, Sir – please. [Laughter.]Sir, let me continue with the Budget. A large part of the estimated Budget deficit for 2020, as Deputy Prime Minister Heng have explained in his Budget Statement, it should fund measures to address the impending difficult economic landscape that confront Singapore as a result of the COVID-19 virus outbreak. This includes the $4 billion Stabilisation and Support package for workers and businesses and also the $1.6 billion Care and Support package to help Singaporeans with household expenses.In the Budget Statement, the sentence that captured my attention the most, was when Deputy Prime Minister Heng announced that there will be no draw on our reserves, no draw on our reserves. For FY2020, we have an expansionary budget with an estimated $10.5 billion deficit, but we need not draw on our reserves. Why? Only because the Government had accumulated sufficient budget surpluses during this term of Government.As we have read in recent international media of other jurisdictions, similarly announcing support packages in their respective economies, I doubt you will find a jurisdiction that can say that they are able to fund such support packages in the manner that we have. I have not seen any.During previous Budget debates in this term of Government, I am sure Members of this House will also recollect repeated calls for more spending of the surpluses or the use of more income derived from our reserves. There was even suggestion that the Government had a political agenda behind more prudent spending in the early years of a term of government.Had the Government done as what was popularly asked–spend more in the good years– then, this year, we could very well have had to dip into our reserves in order to introduce first-instance measures to support Singaporeans as a result of the COVID-19 virus outbreak. I used the term \"first-instance\" because I worry that we may not have seen the eye of this particular storm. Even as we speak, we continue to see worrying signs of the COVID-19 virus outbreak seriously affecting many countries, such as Japan, South Korea, Italy, Iran and many others. We can anticipate further adverse headwinds against Singapore's globally interconnected economy. We could very well require even further measures from the Government to support and assist Singaporeans in the days ahead.Sir, in my mind, there is another term for consistent financial prudence in our Budgets and, that is, always be ready and prepared for any eventuality. And I am sure I am not alone when I say that I am glad we did so for the past five years and, indeed, for many terms of Government before.In the premises, Sir, I would invite our Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister to share with us the Government's intentions and plans to further support Singaporeans and businesses in the event that the situation is drawn out over a prolonged period of time.11.32 amMr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris-Punggol):Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Budget Statement was read by Deputy Prime Minister Heng, I felt very privileged to be on both sides of the fence. I had been a part of the team that was trying to figure out some of the schemes and programmes to be rolled out each Budget and I am now on the other side of the fence as a beneficiary of some of the programmes and schemes itself.When I left the Ministry in the middle of 2017, I had wanted to set up my own ventures and businesses and I chose the most difficult path to do so. I chose businesses and ventures of a B2C nature, which is to create a consumer product, a consumer brand, starting from zero and I wanted to see if I could do it with the environment that Singapore offers, with all the different measures, grants and schemes that the Ministry offers. So, it has been a very good two-and-a-half years, but a lot of grinding and a lot of pain and also a lot of risks taken. It was not easy. But at the same time, I felt assured because I know that Singapore's business environment is one of ease of access as well as one that you could approach and feedback, where you could actually have help and assistance. But, of course, many in the business circle would say, \"Well, you had been an officeholder, you were a Member of Parliament. So, you have an advantage.\" Not so.On the other hand, I took a lot of measures and also a lot of different ways to hide and not show which companies I owned and how I did it and actually worked behind the scenes really, really hard in order to grow those businesses. So, piece by piece, layer by layer, I built my business and I am very lucky, very blessed that, today, my venture in the consumer product business is profitable. I know many fall by the wayside and, out of 10, probably nine will fail. I am just lucky to be able to do so. I would not deny that some grants and programmes were made available for me or my company to be able to tap on them. But at the same time, it is very much dependent on ourselves as business people to do so, to be able to come up with solutions, with what the market needs and what the consumer wants and we can build a successful business from there.Sir, the Government grants, schemes and programmes throughout each year are not an end-all and be-all. They cannot be the most critical function or most critical part of the business. I know that many businesses apply for those grants and schemes, hoping for additional cash flow. Yes, they are temporary relief measures, but they are not permanent. At the end of the day, someone must want to buy your product, work with you and believe in your company in order to invest in it in order for it to grow.Sir, when I went through some of the speeches in the previous two days, I understand that Mr Leon Perera actually mentioned about slowing down some growth of the reserves and maybe putting in more investment into our people to be more creative, entrepreneurial and innovative. I do not disagree with that. But I think slowing down the growth of the reserves is not the way to go because, no matter what, we need to build up the foundation in order to take on the rainy days or challenges to come and deal with COVID-19. It is very clear that we have the facility and resources to handle some of these challenges. But, without which, we will find it a struggle to manage. It is like running the day-to-day business in every other way; you would want to have the reserves in order to handle some of these rainy days.Sir, more importantly, these reserves and how we use them are extremely important. How the grants are rolled out is extremely important– asmart allocation of these resources and what kind of outcomes that we can get– those are the first things. And those schemes must be targeted to help, to be able to do so. I think more and more of those schemes for businesses are now very targeted. But having too many of those grants and schemes and we risk going into a welfare state for businesses. That, I would not encourage.Secondly, we must make sure that we define success carefully. What is business success? Some people say, \"Raise as much capital as you can if you are a start-up so that you have millions and millions\", but you make losses. If you are a unicorn, it is okay to make losses and you raise a lot of money. Well, I do not buy that. I am pretty traditional in some sense, maybe a Teochew businessman type, which is that all businesses still have to be profitable. You can raise a lot of money, you can make a lot of losses, but no end to come, you would not see the tipping point. You will struggle. You will still struggle. So, you will hone your skills in fundraising but not hone your skills in building the business. That is a worry.So, how do you define success? Is success an exiting of the business when you gain or what? I believe that success in business, to me, is about building a business with a social conscience. The product or services that you provide must have some social impact in order to make it very meaningful. But at the same time, commercially viable. That, to me, is the most important.Thirdly is to have the environment. So, whatever reserves and schemes we have are to be able to create the environment for some risk-taking, embracing failures, so that our people do not give up. They try and keep trying. I think that is the most difficult part in terms of culture. But you can see our Government is so pro-business. Every which way, when there is a crisis, it will come up with more and more schemes. COVID-19 is a great example. You see a comprehensive slew of schemes and measures. Sometimes, I wonder, so many of them, I am also confused. Right? And I was also a culprit–creating those schemes and programmes as well. But at the end of the day, it is with good intention. The question is whether we are cushioning and detaching businesses from reality. Would they be more competitive when they go overseas? In COVID-19, I faced the same problem. I have both B2B and B2C businesses, especially B2C business dealing with consumers who are facing demand issues because the whole environment has been affected.So, there are a few things that go through my mind when it comes to COVID-19–the crisis itself, how it affects businesses. A few points here.First, when I review my own businesses, all SMEs should ask ourselves whether we have the capital and resources like cash that can last us for the next two to three months if we are in the worst-case scenario–no demand, no revenue or minimal revenue. Can we handle or sustain? If we cannot, well, there are schemes where the Government is taking up a greater risk of the bank loan. So, borrow money, right? You can try. But I also know that, on the ground, sometimes it is difficult because the banks are not changing their risk assessment to let you have access to the capital. So, you have to keep trying. The first thing is to ask ourselves whether we have enough; second, maybe look for big companies. Right? And I am glad that Minister Chan, in one of the dialogues, said that big companies should help small companies. I hope so. But big companies have their own objectives, too. Unless a small company has value for the big companies, it is very hard to have a big company wanting to help a small company. So, what do you look for? Maybe an exit through the big company–let the big company acquire your small company or you just close it down, move on and move along.Secondly, COVID-19 does offer opportunities, too. For example, I had wanted to recruit this talent for a long time. But because of COVID-19, his company retrenched him. Suddenly, I have him available. Immediately, I recruited him. I would like to pay him the market rate, but I also could not afford it. So, he was willing to lower his salary and, suddenly, I have a great talent for IT in my company today and we are growing. He is glad that he joined a growing company. But he was willing to be able to say \"I joined the company. I managed my expectations. Let us grow it together\", which was an opportunity.So, the talents are out there. Whilst I know the Government tells us, \"Let us train our workers, people and executives\". Well, also look out for some of these access to talents. NTUC actually came up with the Job Security Council. Maybe it is something that we can have access to some of the PMEs over there to see where we can do the matching. So, it is not all about retrenchment but about growing, too. So, this COVID-19 is not exactly all gloom and doom for many companies. Some of us are actually growing.Thirdly is to focus on the demand. Companies should focus on the demand. Is your product really having that demand? Maybe during this time, there are a few things that you have to do. First, lower your price, right? Second, refine your product again. Third, reposition your product. A lot of times, when it comes to this kind of crisis, we will look up to the Government to see what schemes to apply. I was telling my staff and my team this morning I do not think we want to do that. We look for competitiveness. We lower our price and we have to expand our market. Go overseas, go to new markets. Of course, I am already overseas. But where are the newer markets to expand your market and expand your revenue base? Because that is where we can help. And we realised that one of the markets that we are going to used to be 30% highercost and is now 30% lowercost if I were to launch my product there and I thought \"Why not?\" That offers an opportunity.At the end of the day, it is important to know that a lot of these things that we are doing today, we have to change. We may call it \"transformation\". But I will just say that it is just a transition, it is just a change. If you have been selling your product from a shop, then it is time for you to think about selling it online, without the sunkcosts, without additional labour, you sell it online, figuring out how to do the logistics and delivery. I think a lot of people say \"We want to do it\" but, at the end of the day, they may not do it.Most importantly is that at the end of COVID-19 or any other crisis or challenge, let us not give up. Let us not give up on what we can do because Singapore is in a much better shape not just in tackling the COVID-19 issues, the virus itself and making sure of healthcare but business-wise as well. I still see vibrancy in our businesses; I still see revenues rising for some of the companies. It is not everybody is doing badly. So, because of that, we can work together, both public and private sectors, as well as all of us in the House, to help bring this economy back up again. [Applause.]Mr Speaker: Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat.11.43 amThe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat): Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Members of this House for the thoughtful debate over the past two days. In particular, I would like to thank the 54 Members of Parliament, including all nine Nominated Members of Parliament, who rose to offer your perspectives and suggestions. I do not have 57 files; just two. I have also learnt many new terms, including Mr Lim Swee Say's H2P2 or Happy and Healthy, Productive and Purposeful; Prof Lim Sun Sun's 3Ms, which is not massively more money, but \"mobility, maturity, mentality\"; and Mr Ang Hin Kee's \"woon woon jiak beehoon\" or steadily, we eat the beehoon. My special thanks to Mr Liang Eng Hwa who opened the debate as Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Finance and Trade and Industry.Beyond this House, I also appreciate the many helpful, constructive perspectives shared by fellow Singaporeans. They have enriched the national conversation on this Budget and the issues it seeks to address.This year’s Budget takes place under exceptional circumstances. It is a trying moment for businesses, workers and households, having to deal with both the softening of the global economy and the sudden COVID-19 outbreak.How we respond to moments of challenge and crisis is a test of our individual resilience and the strength of our character. Even more, it is a test of our social cohesion and solidarity. It is a test of who we are as a people, as a nation. Do we panic and become self-centred or do we stay calm, band together and look after one another?Since I delivered the Budget statement last week, some have asked why we call it \"Our Unity Budget\"? My answer is simple. It expresses our confidence that Singaporeans will rally together to meet our challenges head-on. It expresses our conviction that we will emerge from this test, stronger, more resilient and more united than ever before. It expresses the spirit shown by many Singaporeans – of staying united, as one people, through thick and thin.Beyond fighting the COVID-19 outbreak, our unity will be the foundation for Singaporeans to press forward and write the next chapter of the Singapore Story. United, we can overcome the longer term challenges of ageing, technological disruption, social inequality and climate change. United, we will make sure that the Singapore Story endures and goes from strength to strength.We should not take our unity for granted. Around the world and closer to home, we have seen societies torn by forces that foment polarisation, communal conflicts and political turmoil. These have weakened their social cohesion and the sense of togetherness that is so essential for societies to meet the complex challenges of the day. We need, as many thoughtful commentators pointed out, a whole-of-society response.I will round up this Budget debate by addressing Members' contributions along four key themes.First, how we will overcome our immediate challenges and the COVID-19 outbreak together. Second, how we should manage our finances collectively to provide for our future. Third, how we should tackle the long-term challenge of climate change and turn our constraints into strengths. Finally, how we can create opportunities for all and build better lives for Singaporeans in changing times.First, let me speak on our present challenges.Having gone through SARS 17 years ago and other outbreaks like H1N1 since then, we are much better prepared for COVID-19 today. With systematic and long-term planning, we have developed new facilities, like the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, deepened research capabilities in health and biomedical sciences, built up our networks of experts and honed our effectiveness in contact tracing and quarantine. Most importantly, we have well-trained and dedicated people. These capabilities are now deployed to good effect to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak.Although we have kept the outbreak contained so far, it has already had a significant impact.In these challenging times, we have acted decisively to protect families and workers through the Care and Support Package and the Stabilisation and Support Package.I have received a wide range of feedback about the support. Many are relieved that we have a strong and decisive Budget, with both broad-based and targeted support. Many Members of this House have asked if we are doing enough, particularly for businesses in the sectors directly affected and those feeling the knock-on effects. On the other hand, some economists have wondered if we are doing too much.We must not fight the current war simply based on the lessons of the last war. Every crisis and downturn is different. So, we should, to the best of our ability, make a sound diagnosis of the current challenges and apply a decisive course of action, or as one says in Chinese, \"对症下药\", fit the remedy to the case.At the same time, we must bear in mind the caution that Ministers Gan Kim Yong and Lawrence Wong have given – this is a fast-moving, fluid situation. While the evidence is that the impact of the COVID-19 virus is more like H1N1 than SARS, its rapid spread through places like Iran, Italy and South Korea demonstrates the fluidity of the situation.We must maintain a state of dynamic vigilance and be prepared to adjust course as new information comes in.Let me address whether we are doing enough and in a timely manner.The overall size of our spending in Budget 2020 is appropriate for now. We have calibrated it to put sufficient purchasing power back into the economy, while injecting a boost of confidence. In fact, our Budget is higher than what most economists had expected. This took into account the context of the global slowdown and wider uncertainties.We are applying the support to where it matters most. Our first priority is jobs.The two biggest items in the Stabilisation and Support Package – the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and the Wage Credit Scheme (WCS) – are focused on preserving and enhancing jobs. With greater job assurance, workers are in a better frame of mind to go for training. It will also avoid them having to cut down too much on consumption. SMEs, which employ the bulk of local workers and whose concerns were raised by Ms Denise Phua and Mr Ong Teng Koon, are a key focus of these two schemes. As a percentage of revenue, SMEs will receive payouts that are on average five times as much as the average for all enterprises. This is on top of the help they will also receive through the Corporate Income Tax Rebate and other measures.Second, we are giving support to those sectors which are most directly impacted by COVID-19.Our sector-specific measures are calibrated according to the extent to which each sector has been affected. Tourism, accommodation and aviation have been hit hardest and are therefore given additional support. In total, these sectors will receive over $400 million, in addition to the broad-based support that they will get through JSS, WCS and Corporate Income Tax Rebate. This will include enhanced absentee payroll support for workers, an issue that Mr Seah Kian Peng raised. Ministries will announce further details on this.Third, we have extended support to other groups who have felt the ripple effects, including Self-Employed Persons (SEPs).We have provided additional measures to support taxi and private hire car drivers, hawkers, tourist guides and operators of F&B and retail outlets. This additional support totals over $200 million and is over and above the support from broad-based measures, which form the bulk of the support for them.Mr Desmond Choo, Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked if we could do more to take care of other groups of SEPs and freelancers who are more affected by the outbreak. Mr Pritam Singh raised the issue of bus drivers. The relevant Ministries will announce details for these other groups subsequently.Fourth, we have designed our measures to be able to reach enterprises as quickly as possible. Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Mr Seah Kian Peng and Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked if we could expedite the flow of the JSS payout to businesses.The disbursement of the JSS payout is operationally more complex due to the need to check and validate information on workers, employers and payment mode. Hence, we had initially projected for the JSS payout to reach companies by the end of July. In the last few weeks, the agencies involved have redoubled efforts and are now targeting to bring forward the payment for JSS from end-July to end-May. Employers using bank crediting will get the payout about a week earlier. Enhancements to WCS will be provided in the second half of this year. This way, we can also spread out our support for enterprises in a more sustained way.These measures in the package also come on top of the existing support schemes for firms. For example, there will be a WCS payout of more than $600 million to firms next month, based on the parameters announced in Budget 2018.We should also look at the measures in the Stabilisation and Support Package in totality. We are providing a Property Tax Rebate to qualifying commercial properties, for which property owners will receive their revised tax bills in April, and refunds of any excess property tax paid by the end of May.We are also providing rental waivers for Government commercial tenants, the majority of which will apply to March and April rentals.For the Corporate Income Tax Rebate, companies will receive their revised tax bills by the end of March. These will provide not just financial relief but also help with enterprises' shorter-term cash flow needs.Many, including Mr Arasu Duraisamy, Ms Denise Phua, Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mr Chong Kee Hiong and Mr Alex Yam have asked if we can do more for businesses and for a longer period of time. We hope that will not be necessary. But if it does, for example, if the outbreak becomes a worldwide pandemic and the global economic impact is deeper and longer, we have the fiscal resources to do so and the will to act. We have the fiscal resources to do so and the will to act.But, for now, let us go forth and make the fullest use of the support available out there before we review what more needs to be done. As I have said, this is a fluid and fast moving situation.There are many stories of businesses and workers who are not just making full use of the Government's support, but taking it a step further to help each other and share the burden during this time of fear and uncertainty.Landlords, including CapitaLand and Frasers Property, have promised to pass on the Property Tax Rebate to affected tenants.The taxi and private hire car companies have taken steps in partnership with NTUC, the National Taxi Association, National Private Hire Vehicles Association and the Government to care for their drivers in their hour of need, even as they face challenges themselves. I thank Mr Ang Hin Kee for playing a key role in facilitating this.Many businesses have also responded to the challenge with resilience and foresight, taking the opportunity to accelerate innovation and invest for the future. This is exemplified by PARKROYAL at Kitchener Road. I visited PARKROYAL this Tuesday. I was impressed by the measures they are taking during this downtime to renovate the hotel, redesign processes, retrain their workers and redesign jobs. They are able to do this because even before the COVID-19 outbreak, they had been making plans to transform their operations to cope with manpower constraints. Now, they are accelerating their transformation efforts, fully utilising the support that we are extending to them.Our Labour Movement has also been hard at work to help workers cope and emerge stronger from this difficult period. I thank Secretary General Ng Chee Meng, Mr Heng Chee How and Dr Koh Poh Koon for NTUC's strong leadership and partnership in this period and all his NTUC colleagues who are here in this House.This is a time for all of us do our part. As Mr Vikram Nair put it, the entire population needs to come together to weather the storm.People from all walks of life have come together to help others, at a time when it is tempting to just look out for oneself. Some are pooling their money. Young leaders from six business families in the Singapore Business Federation, Young Business Leaders Network has set up a $5 million fund called the \"Helping our promising enterprises\" or SBFYBL and Hope Fund, to provide financing help for local enterprises hit by COVID-19. In another example, Maturity Trust, a charity, is raising $500,000 under the Singapore Strong Fund to fund ground-up projects that help the community stay strong amid the COVID-19 outbreak.Many are also pooling that time. Mr Delane Lim started the initiative Ops Hands-On to provide free masks and hand sanitisers to seniors and vulnerable residents in neighbourhoods across Singapore in collaboration with local residents' committees and community clubs. Even our children are doing their part. Students and staff from Wellington Primary School and several other schools made personalised cards to show support and appreciation for our frontline health workers.Several Members of this House have shared heartwarming stories of how the community has banded together to cheer on our frontline workers as it combats the COVID-19 outbreak.Mr Alex Yam talked about how volunteers in Yew Tee baked cookies for our frontline heroes. Ms Tin Pei Ling talked about Singaporeans who wrote messages and prepared gifts to express their support and cheer them on.Our frontline health workers deserve our fullest support and encouragement.Indeed, our frontline workers, especially healthcare workers in the restructured hospitals have shown outstanding courage and dedication. They are out there making daily sacrifices to fight this war against the unknowns. As Mr Seah Kian Peng put it, they act not because they have no fear but in spite of it.Senior Staff Manager, Ziadah Zainudin,has worked more than 12-hour days at Singapore General Hospital's Isolation Ward. Despite missing her birthday celebration with her family, she did not let COVID-19 stop her from doing her job.Dr Melissa Tienresponded to NCID's call for volunteers at its 24-hour Screening Centre, even though it meant sleeping in a different room from her husband and forgoing time with their two children.Dr Margaret Soon, the Director of nursing at NCID and a veteran of SARS cancelled the family trip to work at the frontline. But her family understood and supported her, including her daughter whom she was pregnant with during SARS 17 years ago.The selflessness and commitment of our healthcare workers have shone through as they bravely care for those affected and tirelessly work to contain the spread of the virus. They are an inspiration to all of us and their spirit of excellence has been recognised around the world. [Applause.]While we cannot thank them enough, we can show our appreciation and support in a tangible way. The Government will award public officers on the frontline who are directly battling with the COVID-19 disease up to one additional month of special bonus. [Applause.]This will include many healthcare officers in MOH and the restructured hospitals and some officers in other frontline agencies who have been directly involved. Other public officers who have contributed significantly will be recognised in appropriate ways.We will also make a one-off COVID-19 grant to the Public Health Preparedness Clinics to support them in their active role caring for patients with respiratory symptoms.This gesture plus the many words of encouragement and acts of consideration and kindness is our way to express to you we salute you. [Applause.]We will win this war over the virus by fighting as One United People. Our citizens and institutions all play a part. Enterprises and senior management standing with unions and our workers, landlords supporting tenants, neighbours looking out for one another, political leaders working hand-in-hand with Public Service and the people to do everything that will help. They will help us see these problems through together.Singapore has been able to respond strongly and effectively to COVID-19 because there is strong trust between the people and the Government, and the sense that we are all in this together.The Government can make decisions quickly and carry them out effectively because Singaporeans have confidence that those responsible know what they are doing, care about their health and safety and share their worries and concerns.We do not hide bad news. We do not flinch from doing the right thing. We will go the extra mile to help everyone of us come through this together. That is why people comply with stringent quarantine orders, people accept reassurances about masks, people feel safe and carry on with their lives.The fundamental basis for this is trust and solidarity between the Government and the people.The political leadership will do our part. To show solidarity with fellow Singaporeans. All political office holders will take a one-month cut in their salary. All Members of Parliament will also take a one-month cut in their allowance. [Applause.]The President has informed me that she will join in to take a similar one-month pay cut. [Applause.]Senior Public Service officers will take a half-month pay cut.In the weeks and months to come, we will need to draw deeply on Singapore's reserves of resilience, trust and solidarity. This unity of purpose across our whole society is what will see us through these challenging times. If we conduct ourselves well in this crisis, we will replenish those reserves and strengthen our resilience and unity for another generation. As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah said said yesterday, in Singapore, \"You Will Never Walk Alone\".Budget 2020 provides critical support to Singaporeans and businesses in this hour of need. We are able to do so because we have managed our finances prudently and planned ahead to make sure that we always have enough to meet our people's needs.COVID-19 will not be the last challenge that we will face. When this passes, we will continue to face the longer term structural challenges of an ageing population, technological disruption, social inequality and climate change. We will continue to face sudden and unexpected situations, be it new virus outbreaks, threats to our security or financial crisis.A responsible government must ensure that the nation has the resources to meet these challenges and unexpected events, so that present and future generations of Singaporeans have the wherewithal to survive and thrive. As Mr Sitoh Yih Pin put it so well, we must always be ready. We must always provide for our future.Two years ago, I announced that we will need to raise the GST some time from 2021 to 2025. Various parties have questioned this plan. Some have called for the GST rate increase to be delayed or dropped completely after I announced that it would not take effect in 2021 and that we have prepared a $6 billion Assurance Package. In place of the GST rate increases, some have suggested alternatives including raising income and wealth taxes as well as spending our reserves and more of its investment returns.Which path we choose and how we decide to share the burden of providing public services and building our collective future will define us. Will Singaporean stand together to share the responsibility of providing for our collective future? Or will we pass thecost to our children and grandchildren?In many societies, such tensions have divided communities and created fault lines between millennials and baby boomers. So, it is critical that we make a collective and informed decision to share the efforts andcost fairly, with citizens appreciating the reasons and values behind this decision.Many have been advocating that I give up more sweets, more M&Ms, more and more, be a generous \"财神爷\" or God of Fortune. It will be easier if I could deliver every Budget with just more good news, more spending on everything, more subsidies, more universal handouts and keep quiet about how we will pay for all of this. But this will be irresponsible. It has never been the Singapore way and I hope will never be. Because Singaporeans deserve better.So, I will spend some time explaining the rationale and the hard choices and trade-offs that we have to make. I hope that you will understand and appreciate the care and concerns behind the careful planning. If we did not care as much for our collective future, we would not have thought so long and hard, and expended so much political capital.Let me speak on two sets of issues in turn. First, I will explain why raising GST remains the responsible way for all of us to meet our society's future needs. Second, I will explain why we should continue to steward our reserves well, to safeguard the interests of future generations of Singaporeans.First, let me reiterate why we need to raise taxes. Nobody likes taxes, not even Ministers for Finance.As a Government, our approach is to tax lightly, so that people can keep most of what they earn and so that they can decide how best to spend it for themselves, for their families or to donate it. But there are many critical national needs that are better met by government provision through taxes.These include building up healthcare facilities and services, and providing subsidies to ensure that our healthcare needs are well taken care of.These include important priorities like mental health which Ms Anthea Ong spoke about passionately, and which will be discussed further during the Committee of Supply. I agree with her that good mental health is a foundation for well-being and resilience and we have already started including this as part of our work on human potential that we have added to our national R&D budgets.These include developing good and affordable pre-school services and education to give all children including our children with special needs a good start in life and the best chance for success, regardless of background.These include building up the SAF and Home Team to support our way of life in an era of emerging external, digital and terrorist threats.These are all issues that many of us in this House care deeply about and made eloquent pitches for the Government to spend more on.There must be a role for the Government to redistribute resources in the right way, so that everyone shares in the fruits of progress. Our way to do this is through schemes that enhance the capability of our people – through investments in education, healthcare and the provision of housing, as well as schemes to mitigate inequality like Workfare and Silver Support.Mr Singh asked earlier whether I could provide more details about our expenditure. In fact, I noticed that several Members of Parliament have gone through my Budget Annexes and looked at how much spending has increased for various Ministries. So, let me just take this occasion to cover one important area, an important area because the big shift in public expenditure in the next decade will be in healthcare spending. It will grow significantly as our population ages and as medical technology improves.Now, let me show you a chart that shows Singapore's and other countries' public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP against the share of the total population that is over 65 years old. On the x-axis is the percentage of total population is more than 65 years old; and on the vertical axis is public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP. The triangle shows the year 2000 and the circle the year 2015. So, in other words a period of 15 years.When you look at the green line, South Korea; the purple line, USA; New Zealand, Germany the blue line; and Japan, the yellow line, you can see how they have all gone up sharply as population ages and as technology improves. As a percentage of GDP, the USA is at the highest at almost 14%, Germany at about 9% and Japan at also about 8% or 9%. In Singapore, it has also risen.The dotted line represents the future, projections by the OECD. The OECD had made similar projections for others. So, we did a similar projection to look at what would Singapore's numbers be, if we used MOH's projections. And that is the bottom, the lower dotted line. And then the upper dotted line is if we were to use OECD's methodology or OECD's trends.As the share of seniors increases over time, public health expenditure has simply increased. And as I said, medical technologies will continue to improve. This trend has been played out in Singapore and all the other countries, as shown in this chart.Over the past two decades, our healthcare expenditure has grown rapidly. In 2000, Government spending on healthcare was about 0.7% of our GDP. By 2015, it had tripled to about 2.1% of our GDP. This additional spending has gone towards significant improvements in healthcare accessibility and affordability.We have introduced new schemes such as MediShield Life and expanded CHAS to cover all Singaporeans for many chronic conditions. Since 2010, we have opened or expanded eight hospitals. We have built two new polyclinics and redeveloped three existing ones.Now, do not get me wrong. The spending is not just on the infrastructure. For every hospital that you build, the capital expenditure or capex that we put in, the operating expenditure or opex, is even more. So, it just tells you the trend that we are heading towards.And healthcare spending is not just about treating the sick. It is also about giving our seniors a better quality of life.The number of cataract operations per year on seniors increased from around 10,000 in the year 2000 to almost 30,000 last year. Such procedures were less common in the past because people did not live as long as they do today to need them. And because of advances in medical sciences, previously incurable diseases, like cancer, can be better managed, and patients can continue to live for more years with good quality of life. The number of citizens aged 80 and above has almost doubled, from 63,000 in 2009 to 112,000 in 2019, and will increase further.Going forward, healthcare spending will continue to grow significantly. So, while this is a very good thing that our people are living longer, we must be prepared that we will have to spend more on healthcare. So, we expect public healthcare spending to grow by around 1%-point of GDP over the 15 years from 2015 to 2030. This is, in fact, as I mentioned to you earlier, less than the average increases projected in the OECD countries, partly because of our efforts to keep healthcarecosts sustainable and because Singaporeans have increasingly adopted healthier lifestyles.But our healthcare spending may rise by more than this 1%-point if medicalcosts rise throughout the world and we do not bring problems like obesity and diabetes under control.As Mr Lim Biow Chuan said, Singaporeans must understand that increased spending on healthcare must come from somewhere. Some have wondered if we can spend less or spend more efficiently. Indeed, it is not just about how much we spend but how well we spend. Today, we achieve good outcomes at a lowercost than many other countries.In health, we have the highest life expectancy in the world – almost 85 years – but still spend less of our GDP compared to other countries, as Members can see in this chart, our life expectancy compared against public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP of various countries. In fact, former World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said that it was \"stunning\" that Singapore had achieved its current outcomes despite relatively low spending. So, I will thank our people and our healthcare workers for taking care of their own health and for doing such a good job.Similarly, for education, our 15-year-olds do well in international indices of educational attainment like the PISA test despite Singapore spending less than other countries.We are able to achieve this only because of a whole-of-society effort.On the Government’s part, we have carefully designed our education and healthcare systems to deliver good services in acost-effective manner. We have dedicated and passionate educators who believe in developing every child to their fullest potential. We have committed healthcare professionals who believe in delivering the best care to all Singaporeans. There is strong support for Singaporean families from community groups and social service agencies. And Singaporeans themselves play an important role in taking responsibility for their own learning and health.We are always looking for ways to improve outcomes in acost-effective manner. Minister Lawrence Wong will elaborate on some of these efforts during MOF's Committee of Supply (COS).But efficiency savings will never be enough to fully offset the growth in healthcare spending as the population ages and medical sciences improve. Efficiency savings can only mitigate it. To believe otherwise is wishful thinking.Ms Foo Mee Har shared that some Singaporeans have questioned the need to raise revenues to meet the expenditures I mentioned, pointing at surpluses seen in this term of Government. But our healthcare spending needs are not one-off needs. They are recurrent needs – meaning that these needs will be there year after year. In fact, growing year after year. So, we need to fund them using recurrent revenues, not one-off surpluses seen in this term of Government, which arose from the unexpected rally in global financial markets and the unexpected buoyancy in the property market.We cannot hope to keep on being so pleasantly surprised. Things can very quickly swing in the opposite direction, as we have seen from the COVID-19 outbreak. The outbreak reminds us why we need to plan ahead to raise revenues. We must ensure that we have enough resources to meet our people’s needs, driven by structural factors. Otherwise, we will find ourselves short and have to raise taxes or cut spending in difficult times, precisely when businesses and people need a boost.Planning ahead entails being honest with ourselves and with citizens, and having the discipline to raise revenues in a timely manner.Yet even among those who agree in principle on the need to raise taxes, some have asked, \"Why GST?\"As I have explained before, a broad-based tax like GST is an appropriate and responsible way to pay for major societal needs like healthcare spending. Such spending benefits all Singaporeans and so it is fair for everyone to bear some part of thecost. This is about all of us taking shared responsibility to pay for our needs and our society’s needs and sharing in the effort to provide for them. It is at the same time a Singapore-style GST that comes with offsets to ensure that those with lower incomes pay much less than those who are well-off.In fact, at the individual level, many Singaporeans are willing to chip in to meet these needs. In my conversations with my constituents, I have asked if they would be willing to contribute just 20 cents more out of $10 that they spend a day, if this would help to ensure that their healthcare needs and those of their parents were adequately taken care of. Many were willing to accept this smallcost for peace of mind. The compact does not change when we project it to the national level. This is ultimately about us collectively chipping in to look after the healthcare needs of our families. Each generation must pay for its own spending.Ms Foo Mee Har and some others have asked if we should raise income and wealth taxes instead of GST. In fact, we have been doing so in recent years.In 2010, we made our property tax regime progressive by introducing higher tax rates on owner-occupied residential properties with higher Annual Values. We enhanced the progressivity of our property tax system in 2013, with higher property tax rates for homes and non-owner-occupied residential properties. In 2015, we raised the top marginal personal income tax rate from 20% to 22%. The following year, we introduced a cap on the personal income tax relief to make our regime more progressive. In 2018, we raised the Buyer’s Stamp Duty for residential properties in excess of $1 million in value.In all this time, when we were raising income and wealth taxes to support the country’s growing expenditure, the GST rate remained at 7%. The last time we raised it was in 2007, more than 10 years ago.But we should bear in mind that there is a limit to raising income taxes. If we keep raising income taxes, it will eventually hurt middle-class Singaporeans, who presently pay very light income taxes. It will also risk losing our ability to attract talent and keep our own talents. As Ms Tin Pei Ling said, \"Talents beget talents. There is a virtuous cycle to this.\" It is important to have a critical mass of talent in Singapore to create jobs and economic vibrancy, which will benefit Singaporeans.That said, as important as raising the GST is, it is only one way to meet our revenue needs. An increase of 2%-points in the GST rate will provide us with additional revenue of almost 0.7% of GDP per year. But the increase in annual Government healthcare spending alone that I mentioned already exceeds the amount of additional revenue. So, we will continue to adjust our income and wealth taxes to raise revenue in a progressive and fair manner.We should keep international tax developments in mind as we review these taxes – both personal income tax as well as corporate income tax.As Mr Cedric Foo and Mr Henry Kwek noted, there are on-going international discussions to revise tax rules under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project. Hub economies with small markets like Singapore stand to lose corporate income tax revenue if the new rules are adopted. This is because the new rules allocate taxes to where the customers are rather than where the underlying economic activity is conducted.Businesses are highly mobile in today’s global economy. Companies, especially multinationals, have the flexibility to relocate their businesses out of Singapore to elsewhere. Singaporeans may lose their jobs. So, Mr Pritam Singh asked me earlier about the status of BEPS. Well, in fact, I am glad that MOF officials have been very involved in this international discussion. Some of these discussions are confidential in nature. Some of them have been made public. But I assure Mr Pritam Singh that hub economies will have to bear some negative in this exercise for the reasons I mentioned – where you tax the activity. Is it where the consumers are or where the underlying economic activities are? That change in principle alone, you can work out what the effects will be for us as a hub economy.We therefore need to strike a fine balance between our corporate income tax rate and economic competitiveness.Ultimately, how much we spend depends on how much we collectively have to pay in the form of taxes. This chart shows the standard GST or value-added tax rates that other jurisdictions adopt, compared with our future rate of 9%. Among the Nordics, for example, the value-added tax rates are as high as 25%. They also have top personal income tax rates as high as over 50%. They have accepted higher taxes as the price for their higher social spending.Even as we seek to keep the GST rate low, we have to make trade-offs as we increase our spending for our healthcare and other needs. After raising the GST to 9%, it will still be lower than the average rate in Asia and less than half of the average rate in OECD countries today. Many countries in the region and elsewhere have standard GST rates that exceed 9%. Even Saudi Arabia, a country with huge oil reserves, is carefully planning ahead and introduced a 5% value-added tax from 2018. Do we have oil? No.So, let me address concerns raised about the impact of the GST hike on the lower income and the impact oncost of living.In designing our fiscal system, we have always sought to achieve a fair and progressive balance where the better-off contribute more and the lower income receive more support. This overall philosophy is a key consideration in how we design the GST and how we will implement the GST hike.This is why I have announced an Assurance Package to cushion the increase for all Singaporeans when the revised GST rate kicks in by 2025. This provides a bigger and thicker cushion to the lower and middle income, including many seniors.The package effectively delays the impact of the GST increase for the majority of Singaporean households for at least five years. For lower income Singaporeans, the offset will be even higher and hence, there is effectively no increase for them for 10 years.There have been questions over the logic of raising GST and providing a $6 billion Assurance Package for GST, and whether we can just delay or not even increase the GST rate at all. Delaying the GST increase is not the same as raising the GST and providing offsets. This is because of the design of our system and the resulting incidence of the GST burden.Today, we flow part of the GST revenue back in the form of a GST Voucher that gives more to those who need it most, particularly the lower income and retiree households. This is a permanent part of our system and will be enhanced when the GST hike takes place.The GST Voucher reduces the net GST borne by lower and middle income households. Net GST is the amount of GST borne by each household, after accounting for the GST Voucher they receive. With the GST Voucher, the bottom 40% of resident households are estimated to account for less than 10% of the net GST borne by all households and individuals. On the other hand, a significant part of the net GST is borne by foreigners and higher income households.Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked what proportion of the GST is borne by this group. Foreigners residing in Singapore, tourists and the top 20% of resident households are estimated to account for over 60% of the net GST borne by all households and individuals. This is after taking into account GST refunded under the Tourist Refund Scheme for goods bought here for consumption abroad. This is partly because foreigners do not benefit from the GST Voucher and offsets, which are available only to Singaporean households.When we eventually increase the GST rate to 9%, foreigners pay the higher rate immediately. In contrast, Singaporeans receive offsets to cushion the impact, through both the permanent GST Voucher and the Assurance Package. And as I said, for some households it is equivalent to not having the GST increase for five years, and for some even 10 years.All in, the GST increase, implemented together with the Assurance Package will achieve several different objectives.Most importantly, we delay the impact of the increase on most Singaporeans, by five years or more, and even longer for the lower income. We can start collecting revenue from foreigners residing in Singapore and tourists, and our businesses make the changes to their IT systems only once.The GST is only one part of our fiscal system. When you look at the system of taxes and benefits as a whole, it is a progressive one. Those who are better off, contribute more. The top 10% of taxpayers pay about 80% of our personal income tax revenue. As shown in this chart, lower and middle income households receive proportionately more benefits than the taxes they pay, whereas higher income groups contribute a far higher share of taxes than the share of benefits they receive. So, as you can see, the top 20% pay 55% of the taxes and receive 12% of the benefit. The bottom 20% pay 9% of the taxes and receive 28% of the benefits.So, let me summarise what I have explained in three points.First, we care for fellow Singaporeans and want to support them, especially in healthcare. To fund this spending, we need to raise the GST.Second, we will take collective responsibility to look after one another. Raising the GST, a broad-based tax, to meet a broad-based need is a sustainable approach.Third, we ensure that we are fair when the GST is raised. Through the Assurance Package, we will effectively delay the increase for almost all Singaporeans by at least five years; and over and above the transitional support, the permanent GST Voucher will further help the lower and middle income.Let me address questions that have been raised over the use of our reserves and suggestions that it should be used to fund our needs instead of GST.The reserves are our nest egg, borne of hard work and discipline. During the earlier years of economic catch-up, Singapore experienced fast growth and had a young working population. Our founding fathers made the decision to save the country’s surpluses and invest it for the long term to build up Singapore’s nest egg. They could have just spent it to gain immediate political advantage. But they were principled and had the long-term interests of our people and our nation at heart.In FY2019, our Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) was $17 billion, or 3.3% of GDP, the largest single contributor to the Budget. This is a highly unusual and a very fortunate position. Most advanced countries, shown in the lower half of this chart, pay about 2% of their GDP in debt servicing of accumulated debt. They collect taxes to pay off the debts of previous generations. As you can see from that graph, the red line is the US and the green line on top is France and Germany, in between at about 2%.In Singapore, as shown in the top half of the chart, it is the opposite. Our reserves generate substantial returns, which help to keep our taxes low. In other words, in most advanced countries, citizens today pay for the spending of the past generations. In Singapore, it is the reverse. citizens today enjoy the benefits of the savings from the past. Thanks to the foresight and policies of our founding generation of leaders and people.You can work out the sums simply. Today, NIRC at $17 billion is more than personal income tax at $12 billion and GST collections at $11 billion. So if we did not have the NIRC, even doubling personal income tax, or doubling the GST rate to 14%, would still not be enough. Tell me – in which other country are citizens able to reap the benefits of past savings in this way? So, let us never forget that what we have inherited is very unusual and very precious. Let us be responsible and steward this properly for our future generations.Mr Leon Perera asked if we can slow the rate of growth of our reserves and release more funds to invest in our people and companies. I am sure he is aware that in 2008, we introduced the Net Investment Returns framework, and in 2015, we passed a constitutional amendment to add Temasek in the framework. This has resulted in a significant increase in NIRC that has gone towards various spending, including investments in our capabilities to generate future growth. Put it in another way, today at $17 billion, the NIRC is able to cover almost the combined budget of MOE and MTI.More importantly, our reserves give us the confidence – as a small country with no natural resources of any kind – to deal with the ups and downs in the world. This is why we have a robust set of rules to safeguard and manage the use of reserves. The President plays a critical role in guarding against profligate spending and to ensure proper use of our past reserves to safeguard Singapore’s interest when needed.During the Global Financial Crisis more than a decade ago, with global financial markets in turmoil and governments around the world scrambling to protect bank deposits, then-President S R Nathan approved the provision of $150 billion from our past reserves to guarantee bank deposits in Singapore, from October 2008 to December 2010. That calmed our depositors.I was the Managing Director of MAS at that point. And I can tell you that our officers in MAS worked day and night to safeguard the stability of the banking system, and totally conscious that we were using our past reserves as a guarantee, but we were also confident that the guarantee will be put to good use because it is to stabilise the confidence of depositors. So, throughout that period, we had a very difficult time but towards the end of it, we did not have a single bank run. And the $150 billion remained untouched. It went back to our past reserves. Singaporeans’ money was safe.In 2009, then-President Nathan approved a draw of $4.9 billion from our past reserves to fund the Resilience Package to help us overcome the Global Financial Crisis. A year later, after the economy rebounded sharply, the Government decided to return the money used to our past reserves. It did not have to, but did so, to maintain the discipline that has allowed this unusual move in the first place.This year, we have not had to tap our past reserves. But it was the same spirit of prudence that allowed us to have enough surplus this term to provide the fiscal support for our economy and our people. But if the situation deteriorates significantly and calls for us to tap on our past reserves, I will make a case to the President to seek her approval to do so.We can do the easy thing and avoid the pain for ourselves today. We can decide not to raise GST to pay for our own spending, but to tap on our reserves and its investment returns instead. But by doing so, we will soon deprive future generations of the benefits that we enjoy today. What would that, then, say about us?During a Parliamentary hearing in 2001 on the Bill to allow the Government to use part of the returns of investment from our reserves, our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew said, “What is the deepest obligation of any government? It is not to the present, and certainly not the past, but to the future.” Let me repeat that: \"What is the deepest obligation of any government? It is not to the present, and certainly not the past, but to the future\".We have a duty not just to those who make their views known today, but also to the young and the future Singaporeans. They are not here today to represent their interests – because they are not born yet! But we have a responsibility to them, and to take decisions which are difficult for us but which will safeguard their interests. Let us continue to keep the discipline and keep the faith and promise to future generations of Singaporeans, by stewarding our reserves well in our time. [Applause.]Climate change is another area where we may not live to reap the benefits of our decisions but our children will. In this Budget, I have set aside $5 billion for a Coastal and Flood Protection Fund. I could have chosen instead to spend it on more \"hong baos\" or red packets, to make myself more popular. But by making the commitment today, these resources will go towards pumps, tidal gates and infrastructure that will keep our children and their children, safe from rising sea levels in decades to come.Climate change threatens our very existence, as a small, low-lying island state. But Singapore has always risen to the challenge in the face of adversity. We have never accepted our fate or our starting circumstances meekly – instead, we adapt, innovate, mitigate and overcome. We turn constraints into opportunities and strengths. Dealing with our water and land constraints has made us leaders in water technology and urban planning.Our manpower constraints constantly push us to automate, digitalise and be more productive. Now, we have a plan to address our carbon and energy constraints.We are meeting the challenge head-on, with an ambitious plan to tackle climate change. We are not only securing our coasts but also transforming our sources of food and water and remaking our entire economy and city for a green and sustainable future.Several agencies are working in concert to execute this, coordinated by the National Climate Change Secretariat.This year, we will update our commitment to the Paris Agreement and submit our Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy to contribute efforts to mitigate climate change.MTI and MEWR will prepare our economy and society for the low-carbon transition by working with various stakeholders and partners to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and seize opportunities in the circular economy.Just as it had done with water, MEWR is embarking on ambitious plans to develop our own food production capabilities, with its \"30 by 30\" target. MOT is working on our vision to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040. MND is making efforts to make our towns greener and more sustainable, and transform Singapore into a City in Nature.These are ambitious plans and we are bringing our R&D investments in urban solutions and sustainability to bear to realise this vision. The respective Ministers will speak more on these efforts and, in fact, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean will speak on this in theCOS.I hope their explanations will give Mr Dennis Tan a fuller picture of all that we are doing to tackle this serious challenge. He and Mr Yee Chia Hsing, Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Murali Pillai gave their perspectives on the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs).The Government is playing our part. We already have the Vehicular Emissions Scheme and in this Budget, I announced the EV Early Adoption Incentive. This will help to close thecost premiums between EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles. Over time, as technology improves, we expect thecost differential to close further.However, while we want to encourage drivers to replace their internal combustion engine vehicles with EVs, we should bear in mind that the cleanest and most efficient mode of transport remains public transport. A car-lite vision that Mr Khaw Boon Wan has articulated, continues to be the main focus of our transport policy. And MOT will provide further comments later.This is a whole-of-society, multi-generational effort and its success will depend on all Singaporeans taking action. I am very happy that many young Singaporeans are passionate about this cause and want to be part of the solution.We are in for the long haul and our journey to tackle climate change will span 50, even 100 years. It is, as one commentator pointed out, a big audacious goal. But if we do not have the courage and determination to tackle challenges that threaten our very existence, what is our ambition for? Such long-term investments, together with our reserves, represent our commitment to future generations of Singaporeans.If we take the long-term view and each generation plays its part, Singapore can face the future with confidence – confidence that we will always have the capacity to overcome every challenge – be it a virus outbreak, recession or rising sea levels; confidence that we will be able to provide for our families and community; and confidence that our children will have the best chance of a better life, come what may. [Applause.]I have not finished. I told you I have two files.Now, let me touch on how we will strengthen the social compact and continue to fulfil the promise of opportunities for all in changing times. Ms Denise Phua, Assoc Prof Walter Theseira and others spoke on the need to tackle inequality and preserve social mobility.Singapore was founded on a vision of a \"just and equal society\" – broad-based prosperity and equal opportunities for all – a society where every Singaporean, regardless of background and starting point, has a good chance to do better.Today, this remains this Government's mission to enable all Singaporeans to enjoy the fruits of growth.Over the years, we have made good progress in fulfilling this goal. But we will confront complex new challenges ahead, including the pressures of technological and demographic change and the growing inequality of starting points, as our society matures.Our response to these challenges will define us.A growing number of societies have responded by turning inwards from the world, even as they grow more polarised and divided within.For Singapore to stay successful, we must have the courage to take a different path. We must continue to anticipate and respond to change, plan for the long term, and find practical solutions to create better lives for Singaporeans. We must continue to stay open and connected to the world. A Singapore turned inwards cannot survive. We must continue to foster trust in society, a point which Prof Yaacob Ibrahim spoke yesterday. Above all, we must stay united as one people. Our unity is what makes Singapore's story exceptional.Mr Lim Swee Say, in his trademark pithy way, said we need \"Glocalisation\" – both a globally competitive economy and a locally cohesive society. This calls for us to do three thing: to transform our economy to be globally competitive, to develop our people to seize these opportunities and to strengthen our social compact by ensuring that all benefit from the fruits of progress and no one is left behind.This will require us to put in place synergistic fiscal, monetary and structural policies. With sensible and prudent fiscal policies that promote growth and social equity, appropriate monetary policy to promote macroeconomic stability to maintain price stability and promotes steady growth, and structural policies that expand the capacity of our firms and labour force for growth.Let me touch on the actions that we are taking in our structural policies, starting with how we will transform our economy to keep it globally competitive.The global economy is undergoing tectonic shifts today and many countries face a new economic landscape. Singapore must move fast to secure growth and jobs in the next bound, or face irrelevance.We have, therefore, embarked on an urgent journey to transform Singapore's economy. We started our work four years ago, in 2016, when the Committee on the Future Economy was formed.First, we are moving quickly to secure our external economic space, to create new opportunities and room for manoeuver in an increasingly fragmented economic order.To ride on Asia’s growth, we are working to position Singapore as a Global-Asia Node of Technology, Innovation and Enterprise, as a trusted and valuable part of the network of global cities that are driving innovation and growth globally. We have enhanced our economic connectivity through our network of trade agreements and avoidance of double taxation agreements. We have also created new linkages with other economies through digital agreements and new platforms and networks, such as the Networked Trade Platform and Global Innovation Alliance. These moves diversify our markets and supply chains and have made us more resilient in times of rising protectionism.Second, we are increasing the capacity of our enterprises and industries to innovate, grow and transform.As Mr Ong Teng Koon pointed out, building up strong local capabilities and eco-systems for innovation is critical to our economic success and resilience. We are, therefore, helping enterprises to deepen their capabilities at every stage of their growth. So, I am very happy to hear Mr Teo Ser Luck sharing his personal entrepreneurship journey by making use of the grant but cautioning that not to overdo it or you will destroy the spirit of enterprise.To strengthen our competitive advantages, we have expanded our R&D investments into new areas and technologies. Through these investments, we are harnessing the latest technologies to transform our manufacturing and services sectors and creating new growth clusters in areas such as urban solutions and sustainability, health and human potential and agri-food tech. We have brought industry and the research community together to experiment and collaborate with the Government in test-bedding solutions in areas like urban mobility.Third, we are mobilising and partnering our industries and enterprises to take ownership of their own economic transformation.We have brought industry stakeholders together via Industry Transformation Maps across 23 sectors. But the success of each ITM comes down to the strength of leadership in our enterprises. Business leaders must have the mental agility and dynamism to experiment and the resourcefulness to overcome constraints.That is why, in this Budget, we are supporting business leaders through the Enterprise Leadership for Transformation (ELT) programme. Our Institutes of Higher Learning, such as SMU, have joined hands with Enterprise Singapore to support this effort. Enterprise Singapore will bring more partners on board the ELT programme in the coming months.And at the industry level, partnership among businesses is key. So, even as businesses compete with one another and seek to differentiate themselves, cooperation can help them do better, such as by forming alliances to capture opportunities overseas or collaborating to test-bed sector-wide solutions. And this is exemplified by the Singapore Manufacturing Federation, which, under Mr Douglas Foo's leadership, is making a concerted effort to transform the manufacturing sector.The Singapore Poultry Hub is another example. A joint venture between five poultry producers and processors, the Hub's smart factory will deploy emerging technologies to increase productivity by 26% and production capacity by 70%. By working together, these poultry producers were able to achieve the scale needed to transform a labour-intensive process. So, though they remain competitors, they certainly did not chicken out from working together!As Minister Josephine Teo reminded us, economic transformation is not painless. Businesses must be willing to bear the transitional pains, to be creative and resourceful, and to seize opportunities where others see challenges.Encouragingly, we are starting to see the fruits of our moves to transform the economy.Productivity has grown in the last three years and our enterprises are entering new markets. We are also seeing continued confidence and investment in Singapore despite economic headwinds. Investment commitments attracted by EDB in 2019 amounted to $15.2 billion in Fixed Asset Investments and $9 billion in Total Business Expenditure per year. These show that we are taking steps in the right direction.Most importantly, our efforts are creating more and better jobs for all.Over the last 10 years, local employment has grown steadily, adding more than 41,000 jobs each year on average. Local unemployment has stayed low, at about 3.2% of resident labour force in December 2019, on a seasonally-adjusted basis.Above all, locals are benefiting from the jobs created. Earnings have increased.Since 2010, real incomes have risen by about 3% each year for the median full-time employed local worker. And more locals are employed in higher paying jobs.In 2010, 37% of full-time employed local workers earned a gross monthly income, excluding employer CPF, of at least $4,000 in today's dollars, adjusting for inflation. In 2019, 51% of local workers earned at least $4,000. So, 51% in 2019 compared to 37% in 2010.At its heart, economic transformation involves the courage to brave transitional pains as we change the way we do things. And if we can all move forward with this can-do spirit of initiative and partnership that we have shown in the past weeks, I am confident that we will build strong firms that can grow and compete in the global arena and create good jobs for all Singaporeans.As our economy undergoes structural changes, our labour market is also facing profound structural changes.As our population ages, our resident workforce will shrink rapidly, tightening our labour market. People are living longer and expect to have longer, even multiple, careers. And rapid advances in technology and business models will bring more frequent and disruptive changes to skills required at jobs.As Prof Lim Sun Sun and Mr Christopher de Souza put it, change is the only constant and we cannot run away from it. Our collective mentality towards up-skilling must change from nice-to-have to must-do, a point that Mr Teo Ser Luck also mentioned earlier.We are responding to these changes by taking a three-prong tripartite approach with the Government, workers and enterprises working in close concert to deal with these structural changes in our labour market.The first prong is for the Government to invest in critical enablers of skills upgrading and in career support.We have shifted our approach to education to one that enables learning throughout life. We are investing heavily in Institutes of Higher Learning, or IHLs, to build up a future-ready eco-system. Together with other training providers, our IHLs offer a large suite of Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses, many of which are industry-relevant. And together with those provided by other training providers, our IHLs' CET courses provide a key pathway for individuals to gain skills and confidence to make career transitions and to realise their aspirations. The Government subsidises these courses heavily, with subsidy rates as high as 90% of course fees.Beyond education, we are enhancing our support to help workers make the transitions smoothly, and this is especially important for mid-career workers. Ms Sylvia Lim spoke about their anxieties. We must turn these anxieties into actions that improve lives.Our Adapt and Grow initiative helps workers find opportunities, refresh their skills and transition to new roles faster. Professional Conversion Programmes or PCPs, help workers take on new jobs roles and our career coaches give career guidance and help job seekers secure new jobs.When I visited Workforce Singapore's (WSG) Careers Connect last September, I met Mr Lam Kong Chai, 58 years old. Mr Lam had been job hunting for two years. With WSG's help, he was hired as Finance Director at Asia-Europe Foundation. His hiring manager herself had previously received career advice from WSG and approached WSG to fill the role that Mr Lam took on. In turn, Mr Lam worked with WSG to fill a vacancy in his team. So, all three individuals ended up getting jobs.The outcomes of our Adapt and Grow initiative are encouraging. About nine in 10 of those who went through our PCPs remained in employment 24 months after placement. And about seven in 10 also earned higher wages after starting their new jobs. Our coaches work with about 27,000 jobseekers every year. In 2018, they managed to place about seven in 10 jobseekers into new jobs within six months.In this Budget, we have built on these initiatives, paying special attention to the needs of mid-career workers in their 40s and 50s by introducing the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package. We are also increasing the capacity of our re-skilling programmes by providing a hiring incentive to employers and providing a special SkillsFuture Credit top-up of $500 to every Singaporean aged 40 to 60 in 2020.I would like to thank Mr Patrick Tay, Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Liang Eng Hwa for their suggestions on how we can help our mid-career workers and improve SkillsFuture. These will be discussed further during theCOS.The second prong of this approach is to enable our workers to take ownership of their own learning and growth through the SkillsFuture movement.Initiatives such as the SkillsFuture Credit encourage each individual to take charge of their learning throughout life. Together with Government subsidies for CET courses, our workers can access quality programmes with low or zero out-of-pocket payment.Take, for example, a Big Data Engineering for Analytics course whichcosts about $4,500 before Government subsidies at a SkillsFuture Singapore-appointed CET centre. A Singaporean worker aged 40 or older enjoys a 90% course subsidy. The remaining $450 can be fully met from the worker's existing SkillsFuture Credit or the top-up that this worker will get in this Budget. So, the SkillsFuture Credit works in conjunction with the broader CET eco-system of support that we have built up.I hope this assures members like Mr Arasu Duraisamy and Ms Irene Quay, who raised queries on the credit and concerns about whether it can really make a difference.Our Labour Movement is innovating and exercising collective leadership to strengthen individual workers' efforts, for example, the Job Security Council initiated by Secretary-General Ng Chee Meng as well as the Company Training Committees.The third prong of our tripartite approach is to get our enterprises to step up their own enterprise transformation and in tandem to re-design jobs and upgrade their workers. With this synergy, we can achieve more. As Ms Jessica Tan pointed out, leadership must come from employers.The Next Bound of SkillsFuture announced in this Budget therefore mobilises businesses to up-skill their workers and re-design jobs through the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit and the expansion of the Productivity Solutions Grant for job re-design consultancy services. Enterprises who hire local workers aged 40 and above, with no upper age limit, through re-skilling programmes will also get hiring incentives.Mr Ong Teng Koon was concerned that it may be hard for SMEs to take workers away from the day-to-day business needs. In fact, there is no better time than now to do so. Many businesses are already use this downtime to accelerate change.This three-prong approach, building on our tripartite framework, is our structural response to the structural changes in the labour market. We are able to do this because we have been investing significantly in our education upstream, to build a strong foundation to enable our people's success.Investing upstream means supporting every child to reach their fullest potential.Today, over 90% of the totalcost of educating our children from Primary to pre-University level is subsidised by the Government. In all, by the time a Singaporean child reaches 16, he or she would have received more than $180,000 in education subsidies, including pre-school subsidies. Then, when they go on to an Institute of Higher Learning, which most students do, they get an additional $15,000 to $22,000 in subsidies per year.Students from lower and middle income households receive additional bursaries and subsidies on top of this, which I have enhanced in this Budget.We are now investing significantly more in affordable, quality pre-school education while giving low-income families additional support for early childhood development through KidSTART.We are also equipping young Singaporeans with skills they need for the new economy, including cross-cultural skills. In this Budget, I announced our \"70-70\" target, Asia-Ready Exposure Programme and enhancements to the Global Ready Talent Programme.Another key area where we invest upstream is housing, so that everyone has a home.We provide generous housing subsidies to keep HDB flats affordable. New HDB flats are sold at prices below their market rate. Over and above subsidies, we provide substantial housing grants depending on the income of the buyers. Eligible first-time buyers who buy resale flats get grants of up to $160,000.Today, a resale flat cancost less than five times the annual salary of a median-income household. This is much lower than international cities like Hong Kong, Sydney, London or New York. This chart compares the median house price as a ratio of the median household income in major cities before accounting for grants. The ratio will be lower with grants. You can see the numbers yourself.By intervening upstream in these areas, we provide a foundation of broad-based opportunities that enable everyone to earn their own success.As a result, Singaporeans have been able to enjoy the fruits of progress.Now, I will show you another chart that shows resident-employed households have experienced sustained real income growth at the median, growing by 3.7% per year over the last decade. You can see the numbers for yourself versus other developed economies.While the data are not perfectly comparable internationally, the growth that we have experienced is higher than that of many advanced economies. In short, our approach in these changing times is to take structural measures to strengthen opportunity at every stage of life, with all – individuals, employers, unions – doing their part.For this to succeed, the change must come from within. For all the programmes that the Government puts in place, each individual will have to take responsibility for their own growth and learning. If we can all take on a mindset of growth and a spirit of resilience, we can be assured that we will emerge stronger and better to face the future ahead.I have spoken on our first two strategies of transforming our economy and developing our people to enable opportunities for all. But for all our efforts to maximise opportunities for everyone, there will be some who will continue to face difficulties. So, our third strategy is to strengthen our social compact by ensuring that all benefit from the fruits of progress.This Budget provides further support for those who may face greater pressures.First, some face difficulties with employment and ensuring that growth in their income keeps pace with inflation, despite their best efforts. Assoc Prof Walter Theseira, Mr Zainal Sapari and Mr Png Eng Huat have spoken on the vulnerabilities of low-wage workers.The Care and Support Package, which includes Grocery Vouchers to provide help with daily necessities, will help them and their families. It builds on our efforts in recent years to strengthen social support and safety nets for low-income workers and their families through enhancements to Workfare, the Progressive Wage Model, and ComCare.The mayors and the five Community Development Councils (CDCs) have local assistance schemes to support the heartlands, as pointed out by Mayor Low Yen Ling. These local efforts, done in partnership with community partners, local merchants and many others, bring warmth and support from fellow Singaporeans and business owners who are also our neighbours.Second, there are retired seniors who had lower incomes in their working years, with little or no family support. We have announced substantial enhancements to Silver Support to benefit 100,000 more seniors and raised payouts by 20%. These enhancements go beyond inflation growth to provide stronger support.Third, Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Saktiandi Sapaat spoke about the stresses faced by middle-class families that are \"sandwiched\" financially because they have to care for both their children and their elderly parents. Mr Louis Ng, Ms Yip Pin Xiu, Mr Desmond Choo and Mr Darryl David also pointed out that they may face pressures in terms of time from balancing their care-giving responsibilities and work.Financially, we have given additional help for such families in this Budget by providing those with young or school-going children with an extra $100 cash payout per parent, more GST Voucher – U-Save rebates for larger households and PAssion Card top-ups for their parents. Last year, we also announced measures to support parenthood and care-giving, including enhancements to pre-school subsidies, and the Home Caregiving Grant under MOH's Caregiver Support Action Plan.Supporting and strengthening families will always be a priority for us and we will continue to look at how we can do so effectively. I thank Members for their suggestions. These issues will be discussed further at theCOS.These measures come on top of the extensive subsidies that I mentioned earlier in education, healthcare and public housing. These benefit all Singaporeans, including the middle class. Middle income households – those in the middle 20% by household income – benefit substantially from this system. In 2019, they received $2 in benefits for every $1 in tax paid.Overall measures that we have put in place over the past decade to provide good jobs for our people, develop them at all stages of life and support the vulnerable, have made a decisive impact in narrowing the income gap.The Gini co-efficient after taxes and transfers fell to 0.398 last year, the lowest since 2001. This is encouraging, but our work is not done. We will always continue to look at practical, effective moves to tackle inequality and ensure that all Singaporeans progress together.Critically, business and community have growing roles to play. A caring and cohesive society begins with everyday acts of kindness, of philanthropy and volunteerism. These are better antidotes to inequality than the politics of class warfare that we have seen around the world.As Miss Cheng Li Hui put it, graciousness and kindness are indeed part of our Singapore spirit. There is much we can do to build an inclusive society for all, including those with special needs and persons with disabilities. Miss Cheryl Chan, Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar and Mdm Rahayu Mahzam reminded us.This is why it has been my priority to support, enable and amplify the efforts of citizens and businesses to help those in need, through Singapore Together. These efforts are growing. In 2018, individuals collectively donated $2.1 billion through registered organisations, more than double the $960 million donated in 2008. Each donor gave on average about $660, which is more than twice the amount in 2008. In addition, one in two businesses in Singapore gives back through philanthropy and volunteering.Our social service agencies have been doing good work for the community. They too have been going through their own transformation journeys, building up technological capabilities to be more effective in helping those in need. For example, the Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore has invested in an anti-gravity treadmill, so that clients can practise moving and walking in a fall-free environment. Going forward, we will partner the community to support more of such capability-development efforts, through the Community Capability Trust that I announced in this Budget. Such investments and partnerships will help Social Service agencies to overcome the manpower constraints that Ms Joan Pereira spoke on.This good work is not just confined to organised sectors. Our democracy of deeds permeates every level. Many MPs have also shared stories embodying the spirit of Singapore Together.Mr Liang Eng Hwa and many others shared about the spontaneous and thoughtful acts in many housing estates, such as fellow residents coming together to bottle hand sanitisers and placing them at lifts for residents to use. Mdm Rahayu Mahzam shared about the passion among young people for a more inclusive, more compassionate society and reminded us of the importance of engaging young people as we build this nation. I thank Mr Pritam Singh for his support for the Singapore Together movement in his comment about MPs giving diverse views in this House. And I would say that we can go a step further, that the democracy of deeds means each of us taking action to realise the good.It is also very inspiring to hear how several Members of this House are taking the lead to serve our community in their own, diverse ways. Let me just highlight some of our Nominated Members of Parliament. Assoc Prof Walter Theseira, an economist, has been doing a lot of work on the labour market. Mr Douglas Foo leading the SMF effort. Mr Terence Ho, using the arts to enable and empower individuals from underprivileged backgrounds. Ms Anthea Ong, fighting to raise awareness of mental illness among us and to promote mental wellness; Ms Irene Quay, who has served the public passionately in healthcare, volunteering in a hospice despite her many commitments. Ms Yip Pin Xiu, who is inspiring young athletes and showing Singaporeans and the world what it truly means. Mr Mohamed Irshad, who is fostering religious harmony and helping to build a more caring society. Prof Lim Sun Sun for her work on the need to educate our young even better. This embodies the spirit of Singapore Together. And as Ms Denise Phua said, there are so many other areas that we can work together, to take action to build a better society and improve lives. She herself has taken so much action and devoted so much effort in uplifting people with special needs.This is how we should rise to the challenge of inequality in this day and age – by coming together as one people to uplift the less privileged amongst us, with the state providing strong foundations of opportunity and support.I do apologise that this is longer than what everyone had been expecting. But there have been so many good stories, I thought it is bears telling. So, thank you all for your patience in this Singapore Together effort. You sit together to listen to my long speech.Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say a few words in Mandarin before I conclude in English.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]There is a Chinese saying, \"前人种树，后人乘凉\", which means that the current generation plants the seeds which eventually grow into trees that provide shade for the next generation. Our reserves are akin to a tree planted by our earlier generations. Today, this tree is well-grown and we are able to take shelter under it, benefiting from the stable income that it generates for our country.The Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) is already the largest source of revenue for our country, more than the revenue collected from corporate income tax, personal income tax or GST. Without the NIRC, even doubling the GST rate to 14% would not be enough to meet our expenditures.To draw on the reserves or become overly reliant on the NIRC to meet recurrent expenditure is akin to damaging or even cutting down the tree.Our recurrent expenditure, especially on healthcare, is increasing. We need to continue developing healthcare facilities and providing healthcare services to ensure that elderly Singaporeans are well taken care of.Such spending benefits all Singaporeans. Therefore, it is fair for everyone to bear some part of thecost. I have announced that the GST rate will remain at 7% in 2021. But the Government will still have to raise GST by 2025. Not only does this allow us to increase revenue in a sustainable and effective manner, it also reflects our value of collective responsibility.As we raise the GST rate, we will ensure that our taxes remain fair. The permanent GST Voucher Scheme mitigates the impact of GST on lower and middle income Singaporeans. In addition, the Assurance Package for GST will offset at least five years' worth of additional GST expenses incurred for most Singaporean households. For lower income Singaporeans, the Package can offset about 10 years of the additional GST expenses.When we eventually increase the GST rate, tourists and foreigners residing in Singapore will pay the 9% GST immediately. In fact, a significant part of net GST is borne by foreigners and higher income households. Foreigners and higher income households are estimated to account for over 60% of the net GST borne by all households and individuals.In addition, we are also committed to ensuring that our future generations continue to enjoy a sustainable living environment. This is our commitment to Singaporeans. The risks brought about by climate change are one of the challenges that we must tackle. As an island nation, Singapore is highly susceptible to the impact brought about by rising sea levels and floods. Besides managing the impact of climate change, we must continue to build a liveable, caring and vibrant home for ourselves.The 2020 Budget is a Unity Budget. In the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, we must unite as one people.I would like to especially thank our frontline workers for their selfless contribution and for carrying out their duties steadfastly with professionalism. To express our respect and gratitude, the Government will be providing up to one additional month of special bonus for frontline healthcare workers and public servants who are directly battling with the COVID-19 disease and facing higher risks. In addition, we will provide a one-off grant for Public Health Preparedness Clinics.During this difficult period, our Government leaders will stand in solidarity will all Singaporeans. This year, all political office holders will take a one-month cut in their salary, and all Members of Parliament will take a one-month cut in their allowance. President Halimah Yaacob is also supportive of the move and has volunteered to take a one-month pay cut. Senior public service officers will similarly take a half-month pay cut.As we progress, we will meet many challenges. Some will be for the longer term, while some will be more immediate. I can understand that Singaporeans are worried about the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, as we tackle the immediate challenges, we must also set our sights on the future.Zaobao commentator Giam Meng Tuck aptly described this Budget as three prescriptions, namely \"定心丸\" (assurance pill), \"润肺散\" (lung moisturising powder, to ameliorate ill-effects) and \"提神三味汤\"(three-flavoured soup to invigorate the spirit).The Assurance Package for GST, Stabilisation and Support Package, Care and Support Package and Transformation and Growth Strategy constitute the multi-pronged approach that ensures that Singapore does not lose sight of the direction that we are heading towards, as we tackle immediate challenges. These measures will also allow Singaporeans and companies to prepare for the economic recovery during this period of economic slowdown.We are able to do this because we have been prudent in managing our finances over the years, preparing for rainy days and setting aside sufficient funds. At the same time, we have been using our reserves in a responsible manner.The values conveyed by the Chinese saying, \"前人种树，后人乘凉\", remains a cornerstone of Singapore's long-term fiscal planning. We have to continue protecting and nurturing the tree planted by earlier generations, to take care of our future generations and ensure that generations of Singaporeans after us will have enough resources to face future challenges, seize opportunities and build a better Singapore.(In English): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now conclude in English. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have spoken on the vision and mission of this Government, on the shifts we need to make to thrive in the world ahead and how we need to work together to reach our goals. We began our journey as a nation with a mission – seeking the welfare and happiness of Singaporeans, in a more just and equal society. Through rain or shine, we have never wavered from this mission. We live in a time of change and uncertainty today. But it is precisely in such times that our strength and resolve as a nation shines most brightly.Let us not be paralysed and divided by anxiety and fear, but let us be energised and united by optimism and a common vision for tomorrow. Let us rise to the occasion and overcome the COVID-19 outbreak together, stepping up to take care of one another in these trying times. Let us share the effort to build our future and nation together. Let us build a sustainable Singapore, where we and our children can live our best lives in a safe, green and livable environment, for all time and seasons to come.Let us grow as a city of possibilities – an open, globally-connected city, where each Singaporean can live to the fullest, and bring our aspirations, hopes and potential to life. Let us continue to build a society of opportunity for all – where we have the freedom to determine our own destiny, based not on our starting points, but through our own choices and efforts. And let us continue to foster a caring and cohesive community, living as equals, uplifting the most vulnerable among us and taking care of our fellow men and women.All of this is within our reach, if we work as One Singapore. With collective action and leadership at all levels of society and with our diverse strengths and passions combined, we can build a society that we can all be proud of. This is the spirit of Singapore Together, and it is alive today, as shown by many Singaporeans, including Members of this House, who are leading change in diverse ways.Above all, let us never stop thinking for tomorrow. In the long and never-ending journey of nation building, each generation of Singaporeans are relay runners. May we always take good care of what we have inherited, run our best race and pass on a better future to those who come after us.This Budget is about one step in this long race, building upon the sweat and toil of generations who have run the race before us. It seeks to do right by Singaporeans, both present and future, through the financial plans and provisions that we make today.I thank all Members of this House for your support for this Budget. Let us unite and forge ahead as One Singapore, to build a better Singapore for tomorrow. \"Singapore Together, Majulah Forever!\" [Applause.]Mr Speaker: Any clarifications?Question put, and agreed to.Resolved. \"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021.\""

Last year also marked the 60th anniversary of the Ministry. We can all see how much our living environment has changed through the decades of careful planning by MND and its agencies.In 2019, the MND has similarly achieved much. Home buyers can now plan better, project sites are now half year ahead of schedule. Balloting time has also shortened. For vulnerable families, more options and support from the new Home Ownership Support Team.Looking ahead, the MND has not just focused on immediate issues but, like it has always been, visioning far head. There is excitement over the future of our city and our home. The Draft Master Plan 2019 offers a glimpse.Chairman, let us first look at the Budget allocation for MND. This year, MND's budget will grow by 22.2%, or $4.46 billion. Increase is mainly attributed to the public housing development programme and higher spending for SERS and upgrading. Can the Minister provide some details on the new projects to be funded?In addition, I note that the CONQUAS score for HDB flats in 2019 saw a drop of 3.5% to 88.5%, compared to 2018. Could the Minister share why there was a drop in the mean CONQUAS, and how MND and BCA intend to promote better quality workmanship? In line with that, can we better promote more local talents in the construction industry?I, and perhaps many Members of this House, have seen fewer cases of residents appealing for flats. Those who do usually have more complex circumstances. It is therefore a reflection of how our housing policy has improved. But there are still some who need more help or better options. What more can MND do to help home-seekers access their flats quicker?With the open booking of flats, it has afforded Singaporeans who want quicker options to select and book their flats. Could the Ministry update on the take-up rate so far and what has been the feedback received?I would like to return now to a topic that I have spoken of often – the monetisation schemes and support for our elderly homeowners. I am especially happy that the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) has been extended to all flat types. Last year, MND organised an intense round of outreach across Singapore. Many of these roadshows were led by Minister Lawrence Wong himself. This was to raise awareness on the LBS.I would first like to ask what has been the sign-up rate for 2019, and if the roadshows have helped to increased understanding and also encouraged more to take it up. Secondly, what more can the Ministry do to make the benefits of LBS and other schemes better known and perhaps more attractive?Another group that I have spoken about every year has been support for vulnerable families and individuals. I am heartened by the work of the Home Ownership Support Team that Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sun Xueling announced last year. Can the Ministry perhaps share how many have benefited from the targeted help so that they can achieve home ownership?For singles, the challenge remains that there are many waiting in line. Supply of 2-room flats for singles are still lagging behind demand. Does the Ministry intend to expand on the supply this year?For unwed parents and divorcees with children, which my colleague Mr Louis Ng has championed for passionately over the years, can the Ministry also share how it intends to better support them?For elderly Singaporeans who wish to age in place, some have also indicated that they prefer additional services such as \"assisted-living\" facilities. Minister Lawrence Wong mentioned last year that MND and MOH are in discussion on this. Can the Minister therefore share if there has been progress made and if there are now firmer plans for the Government to undertake such assisted-living projects?We all know that we are constrained by our physical size in Singapore, but our circumstances have driven us to find innovative and forward-looking solutions to afford us the best use of this limited resource, so that we can maintain a careful balance of responsible and responsive land usage. Amidst a rapidly changing global environment, what are we doing to retain our competitive edge while ensuring that our city remains liveable for our people, even with the changing aspirations?Our city centre is perhaps our most recognisable and visible skyline. However, it is also the hardest to rejuvenate.Last year, the CBD Incentive and Strategic Development Incentive Schemes were launched to promote rejuvenation. Can the Ministry provide an update on the progress made to date? I further urge that we continue to ensure that the Central Business District (CBD) and our city centres are not exclusive enclaves, but accessible and open to all Singaporeans.Another topic that I have been passionate about is how our redevelopment and rejuvenation cannot be at thecost of our heritage. Many of our buildings have been lost over the years in the name of progress and better land use. I applaud the Ministry's efforts in recent years to better protect our built heritage. I would like to urge MND and the National Heritage Board (NHB) to work together to do more to ensure that our heritage as well as the soul of these buildings are not lost.I return to the Minister's emphasis on partnerships. As we work with professionals and stakeholders to build the future Singapore, our towns, our workplaces, I would like to urge for more community involvement in the plans, so that the very people who live, work and play in these areas have a stake in shaping it.For estate upgrading, we have seen a successful example in Tampines Central. How will the Ministry better encourage such efforts? The Lively Places Programme, which was a pilot by HDB last year, has seen enthusiastic response. What projects have come out of this initiative? I would like ask the Ministry to expand on this programme throughout all our towns in Singapore.On a related effort, we are known as a City in a Garden, a vision first expoused by our chief gardener, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Over the last 50 years, we have made much progress in greening Singapore. We have become a Garden City and then A City in a Garden. What are the Ministry's plans for the next bound of he greening of Singapore? How can Singaporeans also be more involved in this effort?Many of our multi-storey car park roof decks, for example, are often empty. I therefore urge that NParks will consider a more ambitious programme to green those roofs and promote more community projects.Related to this, of course, is our national efforts to combat climate change. I welcome the announcement of the Green Towns Programme. Though much of this will apply to new developments, I ask that the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and HDB look at how we can push such innovations and apply them rapidly to our existing towns, as this is where most energy wastage is likely to occur with older infrastructure. Our new flats and commercial buildings should also be designed to take full advantage of natural air flows so as to reduce the need for reliance on air-conditioning. Especially amidst the lessons of this COVID-19 outbreak, natural ventilation is better than air-conditioning in reducing the chance of spread.In further light of COVID-19 and the slowing economy, many developers that I have spoken to have found it difficult in the last few months. There have been manpower shortages due to slow return of workers, there have been issues with supply chain and equipment, and all-round uncertainty over the economy. I have further heard from the developers that I spoke to that they project a lean year ahead, with delays in construction as well as potential difficulties in selling their completed projects.I therefore ask the Ministry to consider revamping the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) temporarily, perhaps to extend the number of years subject to the state of the economy.I also ask the Ministry to help spur the construction industry, especially for small and medium players, by increasing the number of local rejuvenation projects such as Remaking Our Heartland (ROH), Large-Scale Town-Wide (LSTW) projects, Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) projects.Mr Chairman, we are not done building Singapore. I agree wholeheartedly with this statement. As we rejuvenate and look towards the future, as we view with excitement the possibilities, we must never lose sight of the purpose of the Ministry of National Development (MND) – to keep to this Government's social contract with Singaporeans, so that every Singaporean will have fair access to affordable homes, accessible workplaces, liveable environments, a future-ready city and ultimately, a better Singapore for all of us and also our future generations. Mr Chairman, I beg to move.Question proposed.Residents' Viewpoints and ExperiencesThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin): Municipal issues concern all residents, and so each resident should have a stake in the shared living environment and be able to contribute their unique viewpoints and experiences to shape it. At the same time, the diversity of residents' perspectives and needs should be taken into account.Could the Municipal Services Office (MSO) share how it is enabling residents, at the individual level and as a community, to have a say in municipal issues?Affordable and Accessible HousingMr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Chairman, since its inception, HDB has played a critical role in ensuring affordable and accessible housing for Singaporeans. It is an institution at the forefront of public housing. No other Government agency in the world can boast that it has provided for over 80% of its people the selection of quality public housing it had, served by comprehensive networks of amenities.HDB flats are the de facto homes for our newly-weds and many of them will progress to upgrade to bigger units. Those located at town hubs and near Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations are especially coveted by home-seekers. However, the waiting time of three to four years for a Built-To-Order (BTO) flat is quite long, particularly so for young families with babies on the way.Would MND review this and do more to help home buyers access new flats more quickly? In 2019, how many flats were given up by prospective buyers and what were the take-up rates of Sale Of Balance flats? MND launched the open booking of flats last year. How has the take-up been?It is understandable that HDB has been calibrating the size of flats based on a combination of the size of the family unit and affordability. This has generally resulted in smaller flats being constructed. I have observed at recent Edusave Merit Bursary Awards ceremonies in my constituency that there seems to be more families with more children, that is, three or more. These families usually have a domestic helper or live with grandparents, so extra rooms and more living space are needed. May I request that HDB consider selectively including a higher proportion of bigger units, such as 5-room flats, in new BTO projects in mature estates to support our pro-family policy?Building Our Future Home and CityMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Mr Chairman, greening and renewing our housing estates is an important initiative to increase our green cover and promote environmental sustainability. I note that community roof gardening and installation of solar panels are also some of the initiatives that the newer housing estates benefit from. However, we must not neglect the older, mature housing estates. Despite the regular upgrading and maintenance projects, the difference between the older and newer estates can be quite stark due to the availability of community amenities, deployment of technology, amongst others.Safety of the building structure and living areas of the mature estates and flats are very important to ensure that those living in them are safe and sound environmentally, particularly, our elderly Singaporeans.What are the plans to rejuvenate our older mature estates to keep them vibrant places to live in, and ensure that they remain safe, green and environmentally sustainable? I hope the Minister will also explore the usage of solar panels in all the roofs of mature HDB estates. As rejuvenating all estates would be a massive project, may I suggest assessing the gaps between the infrastructures in comparison to the newer ones, and prioritising estates with a wider disparity?Second, can HDB work with the existing Residents' Committees, networks and advisers to set up a constituency-based housing safety team, or HOST, made up of residents, HDB and other partners, to gather timely feedback and statistics, and assess the potential wear-and-tear of internal structures of mature flat units before they become dangerous to occupants? HOST can do regular checks of HDB units by block to see if there is a common flat-wide issue that can be rectified before it worsens and affects other residents' safety.4.45 pmHeritageMr Teo Ser Luck: Chairman, recently I took a drive back to where I grew up in from when I was a baby until I was about 12 years old. It was in Hougang. We used to call it \"Hougang luck kor jiok\" in Teochew, which roughly translates to \"Hougang six pieces of stone\". Basically, when I mentioned that to the elderly folks, there is a certain warmth in that. Because of that, I realised that there are places where I had gone to when I was in Secondary school, such as Farrer Park where we used to play football, which are still being preserved.Strangely, the place I went back to, which is \"Hougang luck gor jiok\", where I grew up in, the rental unit above a provision shop is still there. It is just that one stretch of provision shops and some of the shops are still there – very old – but everywhere else has changed. So, that preservation was really meaningful to someone like me. I think, for every town, heritage is the identity and soul of the place.Would the Ministry consider having that as part of its policy when doing town planning for all the major towns to have a certain heritage to exist for a longer time period?Rejuvenating our CityMr Arasu Duraisamy (Nominated Member): Sir, Singapore has done well in greening over the last 50 years. We have become a Garden City and, now, A City in a Garden and, in the near future, City in Nature. Today, greenery is all around us, with parks and gardens close to our homes and workplace, trees along our roads and vertical greenery on some of our buildings.But as we develop, there will always be increasing trade-offs between greenery and other infrastructure developments. The next phase of our greening journey must address this challenge. Can we continue to grow as a city while remaining green and liveable? Can the Ministry share its plans on addressing the trade-offs between greenery and infrastructure developments?At a time when our challenges are becoming more complex, partnering Singaporeans across multiple domains to tap on our diverse strengths is vital and our citizens also have a greater desire to contribute, to be heard and to act.The Government has done an excellent job of engaging communities in building Singapore. For instance, the public was involved in the Draft Master Plan 2019 process through workshops and exhibitions. The community is also increasingly involved in directly shaping and caring for the areas around them, such as residents managing their community gardens via the Community in Bloom programme. But can we do more?As we make plans to rejuvenate our city and enter into the next phase of our greening journey, we must get the community involved at an early stage. These engagements will help to foster a greater sense of communal bonding, for the public will also feel a stronger sense of ownership in the space that they have helped to build and, thus, there is a higher chance of better utilisation of these rejuvenated spaces, as they are the outcomes of the community's involvement.Could the Ministry share how the Government intends to involve the community in rejuvenating our city and in greening Singapore?Keeping Housing Affordable and AccessibleMr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member): Deputy Chairman, this cut is on ensuring that our public housing is affordable and accessible. I note that MND increased the household income ceiling for subsidised flats last year. My questions are supply-related and are as follows.Firstly, what more can MND do to help home seekers access flats more quickly? Related to this, how has the take-up been for the open booking of flats launched by MND?Secondly, how can MND better support the housing needs of single unwed parents and their children? Two specific questions:One, will there be a dedicated section in HDB’s website to address housing queries from single unwed parents? Currently, the website merely states that single unwed parents are eligible and asks these applicants to directly contact HDB.Two, MND announced last year that HDB would conduct a review of the touchpoints which single unwed parents would encounter. Are there any updates on this review?Integrating and Designing New BTOsMr Png Eng Huat: Sir, it is always exciting to see new BTO developments sprouting up in the middle of an old estate. Such developments will bring in new amenities like rooftop gardens, exercise equipment, playgrounds, eldercare and childcare facilities and eateries to complement the old-world charm of mom-and-pop shops, open void decks and good old-fashioned coffeeshops.Hougang has welcomed two BTO projects over the years and we will be looking forward to welcoming another one this year. I wish to highlight some design integration issues of such new projects in the hope that future developments will take into consideration these feedback and concerns.First, I wish to highlight that the void decks of new BTO blocks are no longer functional. Residents living in these new blocks can get lost walking in their own void decks. The number of pillars and walls have literally transformed the new void decks into a maze, forcing residents to use the service road in the estate. This is certainly a safety concern for residents who need to cut across the precinct to get to their destination daily.Furthermore, due to the maze-like design, void decks, chairs and tables have become hidden in secluded corners in these new BTO blocks. Most of the time, these amenities would end up being misused by noisy drinkers, chain-smokers and rowdy teenagers to hang out in the wee hours of the night, away from prying eyes. Noise and second-hand smoke will ensue and residents will end up suffering as a result.Next, I wish to highlight that more could be done to better connect the new precincts to the older part of the estate. In the two new BTO precincts in Hougang, the Town Council had to build extra ramps, footpaths and stairs, in addition to the few designated access points, in order to facilitate the safe movement of residents on the ground. Although it is human nature to take shortcuts, the planner should look into providing a more barrier-free integration of the new precinct to the surrounding built-up of areas at the design stage. This will benefit residents on mobility aids or with baby prams, as it is really not easy to navigate the maze-like void deck of new BTO blocks just to use the designated access point.Sir, town planning is a work-in-progress. It may be a challenge for HDB to design better void deck spaces for now but it is certainly doable to have a truly barrier-free integration of new and old precincts in a mature estate for a start.The Chairman: Mr Gan Thiam Poh, you can do your three cuts.BTOMr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio): Yes. Chairman, recent Built-To-Order (BTO) sales launches had attracted many flat applicants. But for successful applicants, in fact, the three to four years' waiting time is not short. To facilitate better planning for both individual households and HDB, would the Ministry consider allowing HDB to share information at the beginning of each year about the planned BTOs to be launched in the next one to two years? HDB could also allow applicants to register their interest in advance. In addition, the demand and supply information could be made available in real time, enabling applicants to make informed decisions earlier. All these data will also enable HDB to plan ahead to meet demand.Resale FlatsNext. If financial assistance is given to first-time buyers, whether they are families or singles, to buy resale flats is quite generous. Firstly, there is the CPF Housing Grant of up to $50,000. If they live with or near their parents or married child, the Proximity Housing Grant of up to $30,000 will be provided. Thirdly, eligible first-timers can tap on up to $80,000 for the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG).Yet, some of these buyers cite various challenges finding a suitable resale flat in mature estates. The reasons include both financial and non-financial ones. Would the Ministry share which are the top five obstacles these first-time buyers encounter and what further assistance, such as grants, can be provided to them?Lease Buyback SchemeNext. The Lease Buyback Scheme provides a monetisation option for our elderly while allowing them to continue staying in their homes. This is, indeed, 两全其美, a solution which offers the best of both worlds. I would like to ask the Minister what has been the response to this scheme since its launch, especially with the inclusion of 5-room and bigger flats last year. How many households have actually applied for LBS to date? Currently, how many households per room type are under the scheme? Among these flat owners, how many have to use the proceeds from the lease sale to fully discharge their outstanding mortgage loans? Some seniors are worried about outliving their remaining lease. What assurance could the Ministry provide them? Lastly, how will the Ministry increase awareness of the scheme among our seniors?HDB Facade Damage and RepairMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Sir, the HDB's Façade Finishes Repairs Co-Payment Scheme allows Town Councils to claim for co-funding on a 50-50 basis for repairs to HDB block façades finished with materials, such as bricks, tiles, cladding boards and so on.I seek to enquire under what circumstances the HDB will pay in full for such repairs. In my ward of Eunos in Aljunied GRC, there have been repeat episodes of failing block facades in a specific group of blocks at Jalan Tenaga.The Professional Engineer appointed by the Town Council whose report is available to the Ministry has suggested that the underlying cause of the failing façade is down to shortcomings during the construction phase of the blocks. These blocks were constructed less than 30 years ago. As the façade of similar blocks in the precinct have failed in an identical or almost identical manner over the last few years, should not the HDB, as building owner, undertake to fully cover and reimburse thecosts of the façade damage, repair and pre-emptive investigation of other similarly constructed blocks?The Chairman: Mr Arasu Duraisamy, you can do both your cuts.Diverse Housing Needs for SeniorsMr Arasu Duraisamy: Sir, last year, MND extended the Lease Buyback Scheme to seniors in 5-room and larger flats. The Minister also shared about efforts to raise public awareness of the scheme.Can the Minister share how has the take-up rate been since the extension of the Lease Buyback Scheme to the larger flats and what are some of the efforts to raise public awareness of this Lease Buyback Scheme?The Minister also mentioned that MND and MOH would conduct focus group discussions to seek views on the proposed concept for assisted living in public housing and that Assisted Living Typology flats would be launched in Bukit Batok in 2020. Such assisted living flats would be smaller, but they would have more communal and shared spaces for residents to interact with one another.Can the Minister share the findings from the focus group discussions that MND and MOH conducted?Can the Minister also share the kind of features these assisted living flats will have and when will they be launched, the number of units that will be made available and who will be eligible to buy these flats?Supporting Diverse Housing NeedsSecond cut. Over the years, MND has made changes to its housing policies to support diverse housing needs of Singaporeans. With these policies, the Ministry has continued to make efforts to better support single unwed parents who are in genuine need of housing. These include enhancements to frontline communications and the willingness to review every request made by unwed parents, among others.Sir, today, unwed parents can purchase up to a 2-room flat in the non-mature estates from HDB. However, some may need more space, especially when their children are growing older. Can the Ministry consider reviewing access to bigger HDB flats for unwed parents to better meet their housing needs?MND has, over the years, increased attention to support rental households towards homeownership. This support has contributed to the steady increase in these households becoming homeowners.At the 2019COS, MND announced several initiatives, such as the enhancements to the Step-Up CPF Housing Grant of $15,000. This grant was extended to rental families buying a 2-room or 3-room flat in non-mature estates and the introduction of waiver of rent increases for tenants upon their downpayment for the purchase of a flat.At the same 2019COS, the Ministry announced plans to improve physical conditions of rental blocks and flats as well – works to improve the ventilation and lighting of older rental blocks to create more openings along corridors; more partitions in 1-room rental flats to enhance privacy between tenants under the Joint Singles Scheme.Can MND provide an update on the progress of these initiatives?Housing for Single Unwed ParentsMr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade): Our perception of families has long revolved around the nuclear family unit comprising two parents and children. But not everyone fits into this mould. We should take a lighter touch on personal matters, such as marriage and life decisions, when making policy.Currently, single parents who are not married are still under the \"Singles\" category. If they are under 35 years old, they cannot buy apartments. And if they earn more than $1,500, they cannot apply for rental flats. Exceptions are on a case-by-case basis.The \"case-by-case\" approach allows us to use discretion but there is a lot of uncertainty for this group. Yes, we want to encourage marriages to remain strong and reduce reliance on state resources. This is prudent.But can we shift our paradigms and include single unwed parents in the composition of what a \"family nucleus\" is.The need is real. I would like to ask how the Ministry can better support the housing needs of single unwed parents and their children.Waiving Mutual Consent RequirementMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): Last year, I met Gina (not her real name) who is a divorcee. She originally had sole care and control of her son but it was eventually changed to shared care and control.She has successfully applied for an HDB flat when she had sole care and control but it was later rejected at the key collection stage as the care and control was changed to a shared one. She was unable to obtain mutual consent from her ex-husband even though he was already staying in a private property and did not need an HDB flat.It has been years since the divorce and, due to various other circumstances, she is still renting a place to stay in. Her ex-husband continues to stay in the private property.I feel this is terribly unfair. I thank MND for reaching out to help her and I hope MND will consider waiving the requirement for ex-spousal consent on who can list the children as occupiers in an HDB flat application if the ex-spouse has already purchased a private property or an HDB flat following the divorce.The Chairman: Mr Ong Teng Koon, you can take both your cuts.5.00 pmElectric VehiclesMr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee): Thank you, Mr Chairman. Mr Chairman, to promote the take-up of Electric Vehicles (EVs), I would like to ask the Minster whether he will consider opening up the carparks that are maintained by URA and HDB to more than one operator so that they may install EV chargers and whether such EV chargers can be opened up to the general public for their use, instead of only restricting it to the operators' own EVs.Manyresidents have asked me if they can park their normal conventional cars in the EV lots and they have asked me whyBlueSG gets to park in the prime lots right in front of their flats. So, I would like to ask the Minister whether he can consider or he can educate us on how he intends to will allocate prime real estate between supporting EVs and the needs of residents who might have elderly folks or young children.Lift Upgrading ProgrammeSir, on the issue of the lift upgrading programme, I would like to highlight two blocks in my constituency, Block 115 and 119 of Marsiling Rise for the Minister's consideration. I have appealed for Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) for these blocks for many years and I have raised this issue in Parliament since 2012.The profile of these blocks: the residents are greying, there are many elderly residents, some of them are wheelchair bound, many have mobility issues. To them, having a lift is an existential need, it is not a good to have. They become very vexatious when they see that public money is being spent on a nice garden as part of the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) but not the lift that they have been asking for many years as part of the LUP.HDB has cited the need for financial prudence in order to maintaincost effectiveness. But I feel that financial prudence should be about not overspending above a projectedcost, a certain limit. It cannot be, but HDB has been telling me this and it is not about putting an arbitrary limit on thecosts without taking into account our residents' well-being.I hope there can be a resolution to this issue soon, that the Minister can help my residents at Block 115 and 119 of Marsiling Rise to get lifts. I hope that more than a 150 blocks in the rest of Singapore, the residents will get lifts soon, because I believe that that we need to ensure that everyone gets high quality living regardless of when his flat was built or where his flat was built.Mr Png Eng Huat: Sir, the $5 billion Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) has ended and there are about 150 existing HDB blocks without direct lift access remaining. Some of us in this House had asked for periodic updates about the fate of the remaining blocks without LUP. I have also asked HDB to look into segregating these blocks into two categories: those with technical constraints and those withcost considerations. I urge the Ministry to share these numbers.The replies from HDB have been consistent, that is, HDB will continue to study and look forcost effective solutions to extend LUP to these blocks and Singaporeans in urgent need of direct lift access due to medical conditions or mobility issues can approach HDB for possible alternative housing arrangement.Sir, the wait for a definitive answer for residents living in these non-LUP blocks has to come to a finality soon. These residents have been caught in between the wait for good news or to move out for the longest time. And any housing agent would tell you that it would be tough to offload a flat without direct lift access unless the owner is prepared to take a hit on the market valuation or selling price.I have asked in this House for HDB to let these residents decide if they are willing to pay a little more for direct lift access since funding per flat has to be fair and equitable. The Ministry had informed this House that thecost of implementing direct lift access for some blocks is not marginal, with some of thecosts as good as building a new flat.Sir, I would like to ask again for the Ministry to further segregate some of thesecosts as I believe some blocks may only need an additional lift shaft such as Block 363 at Hougang Ave 5. Let these residents decide on the share of the marginalcost.Finally, for lift upgrading that is going tocost as much as building a new flat, would HDB consider offering the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme to these precincts to resolve this issue then?The Chairman: Mr Gan Thiam Poh, you can do both your cuts.Mr Gan Thiam Poh: Chairman, as echoed by hon Member of the Parliament, in fact, out of these 150 HDB blocks, I have a fair share in my constituency that were not able to get this LUP. I just want to find out, since then, has HDB been able to find new solutions to implement LUP for at least some of these blocks or install some interim devices which can help to transfer residents with mobility issues from their floor to the next floor which has lift access? The residents told me they like to age in place and they prefer to stay there.I would also like to ask how many households in need of direct lift access due to medical or mobility reasons had approached HDB for housing assistance to date? How many of them have been able to move to suitable flats with the assistance of HDB?Home Ownership for Rental HouseholdsLast year, the Ministry set up the Home Ownership Support Team (HST) to guide and support eligible households living in HDB rental flats to move towards home ownership. HST had set the target of helping 1,000 rental households within four or five years of its launch. Is it on track so far?  How many families have actually bought their flats with HST's assistance to date?Due to the numerous hardships experienced by these families, would the Ministry consider providing additional grants or more flexible mortgage payment conditions for them? In addition, can HDB provide further assistance to encourage them to become homeowners by accepting the HDB rentals they have paid cumulatively as the downpayment for their own HDB flat subsequently?Rental FlatsMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten): Sir, in a recent survey conducted by Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, it was estimated that there were about 1,000 homeless people in Singapore. About 40% of the homeless people interviewed stated that they had housing registered under their name and 15% said they had public rental flats.Last year, I had called on the Government to consider a change in its policies to allow some elderly singles to rent a flat alone on a case-by-case basis. If we do not make adjustment to our policies, where do these elderly singles go? Should we force them to stay with a co-tenant that they do not know? If we do, the risk is that they may quarrel frequently over minor issues. Or they may end up with health issues if either of the tenant suffers from some illness.There are some seniors who are estranged from their families. They approach me at Meet-the-People Session and say they desperately need a rental flat. When I ask them why are they not staying with their families; the bitterness in the relationship shows in their face.I have also met seniors who had married a foreign spouse. They cannot rent a flat with a foreign spouse. Then, what do we do for people like them?I accept HDB's intention of not wanting seniors to live by themselves so that they can help look after one another. I think in a \"CNA Insider\" documentary, there was a story about a senior, 65 years old, who died alone. However, this current policy may have led to some sleeping on the streets or void decks. The situation is untenable and I would urge HDB that we should do more to help these vulnerable seniors. I ask HDB to consider reviewing this policy.HDB Rental HousingDr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar): In order to ensure prudent use of our limited land and fiscal resources, MND enforces the rule of the Joint Singles Scheme (JSS). But conflict between co-tenants is a problem more than reported. Many suffer in silence. It is difficult for complete strangers compelled to stay together. Many live miserably with frequent quarrels and even fights. The Community Mediation does not work for them for many reasons. These affect the well-being of many co-tenants, also cause depression in some and others resorting to become rough sleepers.Does MND screen potential tenants to be free from mental illnesses or medical conditions before putting them together? If not, can there be such assessments for all potential tenants put in place? Can HDB offer more partitioned rental flats under JSS to provide more privacy? Can HDB provide newer models of HDB rental flats with better use of space andcost as well as giving privacy to tenants?Those that seek rental flats are usually the disadvantaged and more vulnerable members of our society that our Government can assist with more of their housing needs.I want to urge our Government to review JSS, which had been in existent for the last 30 years. Singapore has progressed in the last 30 years and it is time for Singapore to be more gracious towards the most disadvantaged group in our society, in providing them the basic need of roofs over their heads. It is time to tweak this policy for humane reasons.Will MND allow flexibility for rental flats tenants to opt for single tenancy, especially for those with no family members to share with, while also giving tenants the flexibility to share with co-tenants for companionship and mutual support if they so choose.There are many needy families with children living in HDB rental flats. Many of them have lived in rental housing for more than six years and some more than 10 years. Thus, there are signs of entrenchment. What are the schemes in place and the success rate of such schemes, to assist them in looking for better options in their housing needs and to help them get out of their predicaments?Overcrowding–Public Rental Flat SchemeMs Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): Sir, HDB has an occupancy cap for renting out flats and commercial property: a maximum of six occupants in 4- and 3-bedroom HDB flats and four occupants in any smaller flats.These standards do not apply to the Public Rental Scheme. Under this scheme, only 1- or 2-bedroom flats are available. 2-bedroom flats are available only to families of three or more, with some income. If a family is not earning any income, they are only eligible for a 1-bedroom flat, regardless of the number of family members in that family. This results in families of five or six squeezing into a 1-bedroom flat, or even families of more than 10 in 2-bedroom flats.Research demonstrates that overcrowding has a deep and adverse impact on both adults and children. There are significant associations between the number of persons per room and an index of psychological health. Family ties erode: the parent's authority over the child diminishes as they are unable to accommodate the child's needs; adult family members prefer to stay outside their home till late; conflict occurs more frequently in the home; children do not have enough space to play, rest and study, which directly impacts their academic performance and overall development.In light of the above, I have three questions specifically for the Ministry. What is the reason for there not being an occupancy cap for homes under the Public Rental Scheme? How is the act of placing children in 1- or 2-room HDB flats with three to 10 other people in line with Singapore's obligation to primarily consider the best interests of the child under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child? Will the Ministry consider allocating 3-room flats and above to families of five and over under the Public Rental Scheme?Independent Living for Persons with DisabilitiesMiss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan): Chairman, we sometimes wonder why we do not frequently come across people with disabilities and special needs in our community. They surely exist even if they are not the majority in our population. I would imagine like everyone else, they too need a place to live, learn, relax, move about freely and socialise. I believe this may be the wish of some them, but they do face challenges of not being able to do so in a carefree manner.First, their family. People with disabilities and special needs often require the care of a guardian who can assist with their daily needs. It is natural for their family members to be protective to reduce the likelihood of them being mistreated by strangers who are not aware of their special needs' conditions. To minimise awkward situations, people with special needs are often confined to their home, school or places where they can be fully accompanied.Second, mental barriers and confidence in own abilities. With lesser exposure to the broader community, there are fewer opportunities for people with special needs to experience and understand how to manage social interactions or overcome some living issues. This has an impact on their self-confidence and their willingness to break the silence in seeking help.Third, the existing public amenities in the process of being modified to accommodate people with special needs are largely not fully equipped as it was not designed with them in mind at the early stage.Earlier in the Budget debate, I have raised the need to rally society to be inclusive from young. But, beside the soft aspects, I would like to ask MND what efforts are taken in our living environment to enable people with disabilities and special needs to socialise and engage in the community.I suggest the following: One, intentional efforts to adapt designs in our common spaces like the neighbourhood playground, the gardens, to enable their outreach in the community and with designated relief areas for people with special needs to have their private moments.Two, to create the digital apps with information on venues and services that are friendly to people with special needs.Three, to collaborate or create travel journey tools that shows real live routes which are barrier-free access, wheelchair accessible and leads to reachable areas that are not dead ends.Further, I want to know whether there are plans to review areas that can improve people with special needs' daily assisted living in the public housing. Familiarity with surroundings and having the right aids in place amongst their living compound are of utmost importance for them. I hope we can look into using design and technology to ease their burden on the long run.5.15 pmFor example within their home, there can be adjustable household fixtures that are designed to accommodate different physical conditions, hoist to facilitate movements in the toilet and bedroom, voice activated or push controls to automate management of the living environment, sensors within the home that are linked to service care centres or family members and robotic enabled devices that can aid daily activities.Many people with special needs have hopes and goals in life just like any of us. Some of these can be achieved through thoughtful designs aided by technology. We can certainly help to close the gaps in their development journey and enable them to scale new heights, live more independently and fit with greater ease at our shared public spaces.Transforming the Construction IndustryEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon): Sir, before I proceed, I would like to declare my interest as a PE and my involvement in property development and construction.Many contractors told me that they feel discriminated against in recent field contract awards. In the LTA Jurong Regional Line Projects, for example, four out of seven contracts were awarded to foreign contractors. Another example, LTA awarded N112 tender to a foreign contractor, even though our local contractor submitted the lowest quote. The lowest tenderer is an established homegrown contractor. Why pay $6 million more to a foreign contractor whose company is registered in the Virgin Islands? We have about 140 A1 local contractors who have all built up very strong capabilities. If we do not even support our own contractors, who else will support them? Can we consistently apply the policy of \"Buy Singapore First\"?Contractors also shared that they always face payment delays, and hence cause cash flow problems. Some of the causes are:(a) Variation Orders (VO) – the valuation and certification of VOs can drag on for years before they are finally settled;(b) Liquidated Damages (LD) – contractors are imposed LD even before claims for Extension of Time (EOT) and VOs are assessed; and(c) Under-certified payment – it could be due to our \"kiasuism\" culture, so, the work done on site is often under certified.While it is commendable that the Government has taken a long-term view to reducing Singapore's reliance on foreign labour, it should place more emphasis on the quotas of those sectors that Singaporeans would like to work in, which are certainly not in construction or shipyard.With emphasis on Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA) and Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC), we need more S Pass workers than ever before, as they are more skillful. Another problem is that Singapore is no longer attractive to some foreign skilled carpenters and tilers. They choose to go elsewhere. Perhaps BCA can help to investigate the reasons and implement measures to solve this issue. For example, are they finding it too tedious or too expensive to sit for the Core Trade Skills test? With the current push for DFMA and PPVC, are these tests still relevant?As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, the construction industry is facing the full impact of labour shortage, material delays, threat of site lock down and so on, delaying progress of projects. Can the Government do more to help the construction industry? For example, waive the workers' levy during this difficult period.We also believe that some of the Government policies can be re-examined. The current crisis could be an opportune time to review and tweak the ABSD regime to make it more equitable and effective as the current regime is not calibrated, to some extent, it is a one size fits all. This is not a call for an easing of the cooling measure but an appeal for a temporary relief for the real estate industry to cope with the current situation. The following two changes could be considered: first, a re-instatement of the Practical Completion Period (PCP) to six years. Contractors need more time to complete the projects; and secondly, an extension of the five-year ABSD deadline to say six years. Alternatively, the ABSD penalty to be pro-rated based on the number of unsold units, similar to the QC principle.In anticipation of the high likelihood in project delays, BCA is urging developers not to penalise contractors. How is this possible if developers are bounded by the five-year ABSD remission deadline which is very punitive?At the same time, the sale of residential units has slowed down sharply, almost to a stop. I hope MND can understand the challenges faced by property and construction industry and lend a helping hand. Let us show solidarity and Singapore together spirit.Building WorksMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied): Sir, under the Building Control Act, proposals for building works will need to be submitted to the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) for approval. I understand that the Act will soon be amended to expand the types of projects that require BCA approval, to include major alteration or replacement works to fixed installations.In assessing whether or not to approve such works, the BCA will examine the certifications and other paperwork of qualified persons (QPs) engaged by the project owners. To what extent does BCA itself verify the soundness of these certifications?The incident of the PIE Viaduct Collapse in 2017 is illustrative. In that incident, one person was killed and 10 others injured. To date, various professionals associated with the project have been charged and convicted in court. The QP admitted to having engineers with inappropriate experience, failing to check design assumptions and being aware of errors in calculations by the engineers. An accredited checker for the viaduct admitted that he had failed to check the designs or perform calculations for the corbels.In a Parliamentary answer in July 2018, MND elaborated on its standard procedures when dealing with building projects. The Ministry stated that at the plan submission stage, the BCA performs a sampling check of the plans and design calculations of selected key structural elements, to ascertain that the QP and the Accredited Checker had carried out the design and checks in accordance with building control legislative requirements. MND further stated that at the construction stage, BCA would conduct targeted inspections on structural works.As these checks by the agencies would presumably have been done on the PIE viaduct project as well, does the collapse of the structure and the facts found by the court indicate any loophole that needs to be plugged? Is there a need for agencies to play a larger role in regulating building projects to ensure public safety?PMETs in Construction SectorMr Ong Teng Koon: Mr Chairman, the BuildSG Transformation Fund has catalysed many productivity innovation projects last year. In the construction sector, there was a focus on offsite prefabrication to improve productivity.I would like to ask the Minister, how does Singapore compare with other countries in terms of manpower efficiency in our construction sector, and if there are initiatives and schemes to encourage our construction industry to be the best in class.Sir, with the reduction of S Pass sub-DRC, I would like to ask the Minister if this would affect the local PMET's job. Many of our local PMETs typically take on supervisory roles of the foreign workers. Now, if they have no more foreign workers to supervise, will they still have a job?Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister if there are new job opportunities for PMETs in the construction sector. With growth areas such as Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) and Integrated Digital Delivery (IDD), are there more programmes for PMETs who can transit into these jobs?Jobs for Locals in Construction IndustryMr Gan Thiam Poh: Chairman, our construction sector has difficulty employing Singaporeans to fill many of its jobs, from the most humble manual work to PMET positions. The main challenges are the unattractive salaries, long work hours and difficult work conditions.However, the current COVID-19 outbreak teaches us the importance of having a good pool of local expertise for self-sufficiency. It is very important that we maintain a critical size of local capabilities for all job scopes at all levels. We should not be too reliant on PRs and foreigners.I would like to ask the Ministry what it has done and plan to do to encourage Singaporeans to join the construction industry. Will it work with the Ministry of Manpower to implement the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) for construction jobs to ensure good salaries and career outcomes? How is the progress for the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCP) for PMETs in the construction industry?Good Jobs in Built Environment ClusterMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Mr Chairman, the Built Environment cluster, comprising industries such as the Security, Construction, Environmental Services, Real Estate and Smart Facilities Management, is one of the newest growth sectors. With the significantly increased demand in related services, particularly smart facilities, environment and security in recent years, it is a sector burgeoning with opportunities and is a potential exportable service we can provide to the world. How is the Ministry creating good jobs in this cluster and supporting locals to take up these jobs?Singapore companies across the build environment value chain also collaborate on a complete solution for international infrastructure projects. What skill sets would be needed for this sector and how can we encourage greater interest for mid-career switches to this sector?The Chairman: Mr Louis Ng. You may take your three cuts.Improving the BCA Green Mark SchemeMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: Sir, the BCA Green Mark Scheme is a good policy that we should build on. Young PAP and climate activists have proposed that the scheme be reviewed and updated with a more weight given to reducing energy consumption and shifting dependence to greener sources.The School of Design and Environment Block Four (SDE 4) at NUS is a good example. It has net-zero energy consumption. It uses a hybrid cooling system that combines the use of air-conditioning and ceiling fans to provide thermal comfort to building occupants. YP and climate activists have proposed that such features be propagated to new buildings.I understand that there already is a Green Mark for Zero Energy buildings. But we should also raise standards for the other Green Mark schemes. Buildings should be held to a higher standard before we can call them \"green\". Will MND consider raising the Green Mark standards for (a) new Government buildings; (b) all commercial buildings; and (c) all private and public residential buildings to encourage sustained reductions in overall energy consumption? Next.Increasing Size of Dogs in HDB FlatsI am glad that NParks have now a 10% increase in height limit for local mixed breed dogs to be re-home under Project ADORE. The weight of the dog will also be removed as a criterion. This good news. There is about 20% more local mixed breed dogs can be re-homed at HDB flats each year. But we can do more. Can MND provide the rationale for not removing the height criterion as well? Many more dogs can finally find a forever home if we remove the height criterion.I understand that MND's concern is that the smaller dogs are generally considered to be more easily carried and controlled, especially in confined spaces such as lifts. However, size is not a good proxy of the behaviour or temperament of a dog. Researchers have found that larger dogs are perceived as more obedient, less anxious and less aggressive compared to smaller dogs. As the saying goes, \"It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog.\"As part of the pilot, will MND consider removing the height criterion so that more dogs can be re-homed?Allowing Cats to be Kept in HDB FlatsLastly, it does not make sense that someone who lives in a condo is allowed to keep a pet cat while someone who lives in a HDB flat is not allowed. Why? HDB has stated that \"[Cats] are generally difficult to contain within the flat. When allowed to roam indiscriminately, they tend to shed fur and defecate or urinate in public areas, and also make caterwauling sounds, which can inconvenience your neighbours.\"Surely, these concerns apply to people staying in condos as well. Some condo units are even smaller than HDB flats. It also does not make sense that one is allowed to keep a dog, and now a big dog, but not a cat, not even a little kitten. Dogs can also shed fur and defecate or urinate in public areas. What is more, they bark.HDB's concerns can be easily addressed. We can ensure that pet cats do not roam indiscriminately and are sterilised. Sterilised cats do not make caterwauling sounds. I have seen firsthand how all these simple measures can be taken and people can keep cats in their flats without affecting their neighbours.So many people are already keeping cats in their flats. Will the Ministry consider taking the step to officially allow people staying in HDB flats to keep cats?Cats in HDB FlatsAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member): Chairman, Sir, earlier this year, I asked the Minister whether it is timely to consider removing the ban on keeping pet cats in HDB flats and to regulate pet cat keeping to minimise disamenities for neighbours. Minister replied no, citing reasons of irresponsible pet ownership causing inconvenience to neighbours and unhappiness.I find this line of reasoning inconsistent, as this is applicable to all pets and pet owners. But the ban is only specifically on cats.Domestic cats are unlikely to cause the dis-amenities that Minister cited. Studies have shown that cats spend 25% of their waking hours cleaning themselves; their natural instinct is to cover up and hide their waste, which can be done in a litter box. Sterilised cats are unlikely to caterwaul and even if they do, some of the reasons could be to alert their owners to outside activity, or they may be in pain or feeling stressed, which are similar reasons why dogs bark too.5.30 pmThe ban is outdated. Today, many younger families and families of all ethnic groups are pet cat owners. Regulating pet cat ownership in HDB flats will be more beneficial than a ban as it may give many stray cats a loving home and allow cat lovers to take care of their cats at home with peace of mind. Regulation can include ensuring domestic cats remain indoors, microchipped and sterilised and a framework to encourage community acceptance and having mediation channels for disputes.I read with interest the latest news that the dog size limits for HDB have been relaxed so as to allow more local mixed-breed dogs to be rehomed in HDB flats under Project ADORE. I hope cats, no less adorable to many Singaporeans, may be included.Adopting IUCN Red List for Pet TradeMr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang): Chairman, I would like to draw attention to the pet birds trade in Singapore. Back in November 2017, I filed a parliamentary question to ask the MND about the frequency that AVA reviews the reference list of birds available for sale as pets to ensure that species which are becoming endangered or threatened are not sold here.Minister Lawrence Wong replied that the list is based on the requirements of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). CITES amends its list once every three years and covers species for which it is illegal to trade.So, in adopting the CITES list, we are saying we will not do anything which is illegal. Frankly, Chairman, I believe that this is too low a benchmark for us to adopt. I would like to suggest that NParks, which took over the animal welfare function of AVA, adopts the IUCN Red List maintained by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.Moreover, CITES covers high profile larger animal for which extinction is possible. Many tropical bird species, such as the white-rumped shama, which are threatened and may not be on the CITES list but are included in the IUCN Red List. The CITES list is also not as comprehensive when compared to the IUCN Red List especially in covering smaller species such as tropical birds.Chairman, the tropical pet bird trade is a multi-million dollar trade which threatens native species. The situation is so bad that in many forests in nearby countries, some song birds are already extinct.On the same topic, I would also like to propose an increase in the amount of fines for the illegal smuggling and trade of pet birds. In August last year, a Malaysian attempted to smuggle in a record 815 birds into Singapore. Some of these birds can trade for a few thousand dollars each so the maximum fine of $10,000 is relatively low compared to the potential profits. Assuming a \"street value\" of $500 per bird, the total value of birds from this smuggling attempt was more than $400,000. The fine only forms 2.5% of the total value, which is hardly a deterrence for smugglers.Chairman, I really hope that Singapore can show leadership in the conservation of native species and not do what is just the minimum. The right place for a bird is on a tree branch and not a cage Hopefully, when our grandchildren walk through a forest, there will still be birds chirping and it would not be a silent forest.Coordination between Municipal Services Office (MSO) and AgenciesThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministers for Culture, Community and Youth and Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng): Mr Chairman, the Municipal Services Office (MSO) was set up to coordinate between agencies and Town Councils to improve the delivery of municipal services.One key initiative has been the set-up of OneService app. I have tried it a few times and found it easy to use and more importantly, effective. Behind the convenience at my fingertip, I am sure there is a lot of work done behind the scene to make sure the right agency receives the feedback and takes necessary action in time. On behalf of the public, I thank the good men and women at MSO.Some municipal issues are complex and require various agencies to work hand-in-hand. Sometimes, other non-governmental stakeholders are involved. Let me use the example of community cats.In Tampines, we do have many cases relating to community cats that have been difficult to resolve. These could be cats roaming at corridors, defecating, scratching cars, caterwauling, irresponsible cat feeding and so on. Some residents are bothered by what the cats do, some are just afraid of cats, while others just do not like them. On the other hand, there are many cat lovers who spend their own money to buy cat food and go around the estate feeding them every night.To many residents, they just turn to the Town Council to solve such issues on the ground. The Town Council has to work with HDB which regulates that cats are not allowed to be kept within flats, and NEA, which can go after cat feeders who leave the cat food as litter. However, the current practice has also been to work with the Cat Welfare Society (CWS) as a first call.I have met some staff and volunteers at CWS. They are all very passionate and dedicated people who love and care for cats. They have deep knowledge of how cats behave. At our last meeting, they recommended sonic repellents to help deter cats from venturing into certain areas. Tampines Town Council has bought some and we will be trying them out.However, CWS has very thin resources and are not able to follow up fully on all cases. They also do not have authority over cat lovers, cat feeders or pet owners, some of whom may not be very cooperative. So, in some cases, CWS has admitted that they would not be able to do anything.Sir, instead of letting a voluntary group bear the responsibility, should a Government agency take ownership? Would it be HDB, NEA or maybe AVS or maybe NParks? For such issues, could the MSO play the role to coordinate and help set up a sustainable working system to handle such cases?MSO's Technology ImprovementsMr Ong Teng Koon: Chairman, the work of MSO as part of the Smart Nation Movement has tangibly improved the lives of many Singaporeans. Improvements through the Municipal Services Productivity Fund include Parking.sg, and this has increased convenience to drivers and reduce litter and waste generated by paper coupons. And many drivers given the feedback that they appreciate the refunds being to them if they end their parking sessions early.Sir, it was good to hear last year that the Municipal Services Productivity Fund was going to be extended with more funds for more agencies to tap into. One such project was the use of drones by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) for the early detection of maintenance issues, and also a trial deployment of compactor litter bins by NEA for more efficient waste collection.I would like to ask the Minister to share an update on the progress of these projects and if there are any other technology-enabled services that the Municipal Services Productivity Fund is currently looking at.I would also like to ask the Minister whether she can consider the use of smart locks that can be remotely controlled. These could be used in our shared common spaces like badminton courts and basketball courts. While some residents enjoy the use of these facilities, I have also got many residents who will complain to me because of the dis-amenities late into the night.I would like to ask if we could leverage on technology to better manage our common space.The Chairman: Minister Grace Fu.The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien): Chairman, as our country battles the COVID-19 outbreak, I would first start by conveying our appreciation towards all cleaners and workers in municipal services for working hard to keep COVID-19 at bay.Municipal issues concern all of us as residents and, as Mr Baey Yam Keng said, can be complex and involve multiple parties to resolve. We have made good progress coordinating across Government agencies, Town Councils and other non-government stakeholders, to offer residents services that are prompt, practical and personal.With the OneService app, residents can access services on-the-go. We now have more than 200,000 app users who, collectively, submitted over 460,000 feedback cases. The use of Artificial Intelligence or AI, enables our integrated systems to route most of these cases automatically to the right agency for prompt action, with 89% accuracy. This saves about 175 man-days a month, freeing up resources for agencies to focus on rectifying ground issues.To address complex issues, MSO first clarifies the roles of stakeholders involved. Ninety percent of cases involving multiple stakeholders found the case owner within seven days, and since 2015, the average time taken has fallen from eight-and-a-half to six days. MSO then works with stakeholders to develop collaborations that tap on their respective areas of expertise. Mr Baey cited cat-related nuisance. NParks is the first point-of-contact for the public for animal-related feedback. We are tightening the collaboration to manage this and monitoring to ensure that case resolution times and outcomes improve.Addressing residents' concerns about complex issues often goes beyond coordination, so we emphasise services that carry greater personal engagement. I recall a case where residents at Pending Road were troubled by unpleasant smells from a nearby flat. HDB found the flat severely hoarded and infested with pests. HDB worked with Holland-Bukit Panjang Town Council, MSF, PA, IMH, Thye Hua Kwan and Covenant Evangelical Free Church to address the case holistically. They worked over weekends to clean the flat, obtained financial aid for repairs and provided emotional and counselling support – all to afford long-term self-care to the flat owner and a sustainable solution to other residents.This is the empathy and resident-centric service we champion. Today, nearly 60% of our OneService app cases have post poll ratings of 4- and 5-stars. We aim to raise this to 70% by end-2020. MSO will go further, beyond coordinating, to forge meaningful connections with, and among residents.Mr Ong Teng Koon asked about MSO's progress in harnessing technology to deliver service improvements to residents. The projects undertaken by SLA and NEA under the Municipal Services Productivity Fund are progressing well. In 2019, we awarded funding for HDB and PUB to trial a smart lock system that Mr Ong has asked, that automates access to maintenance areas in HDB estates, such as rooftops. We will explore the potential for this system to be adapted to other spaces, together with other solutions, such as encouraging residents to be more considerate, as Mr Ong has requested, to address the root cause of community noise.We are making other technological improvements to better connect residents to services that meet their needs.First, we are integrating services from agencies and Town Councils into the OneService app, to develop the \"Book Facilities\" feature for residents to have a single, simple touchpoint to find and book community spaces, such as function rooms, barbecue pits and sports facilities. In addition, we will introduce new reporting categories, such as \"smoking\" and \"high-rise littering\", for residents to highlight specific concerns for investigation.Second, we are improving accessibility to services, by bringing our mainstay reporting function to where residents are. With OneService Lite, which involves QR codes posted at places where residents frequent, such as HDB lift landings, users can easily report a case by scanning the QR codes in just two taps, without having to pre-install the OneService app. Soon, residents can also submit cases via popular social messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, guided by an AI-powered chatbot.Third, we are constantly innovating to kick-start future-ready solutions. Since January, we have been trialling Municipal 360. Routine feedback submitted through the OneService app will be routed directly to agencies' contractors for speedier resolution. Residents will be updated with photographs of work done directly by the municipal worker.Last November, MSO hosted the OneService-Industry eXchange for public and private organisations to share ideas and co-develop solutions for municipal operations. With more collaboration and experimentation, residents can look forward to smarter, more customised service improvements.5.45 pmEven as we expand technological connectivity, we want to connect residents with each other to co-create a better living environment for all. We agree with Mr Amrin's suggestion to consider the diverse views of residents. Certainly, as part of SG Together, we will enable each and every one to have a say and exercise collective choices that will impact their living environment.For a start, we have included new OneService app features to activate our community to make the changes they want to see. Residents will be able to poll on local improvement works through \"What Say You?\" surveys and use the \"Community Challenge\" feature to take bite-size, meaningful actions that help address issues that concern them.We must also augment hardware with \"heartware\", by nurturing more community participation and partnership. During a pilot in Yio Chu Kang to reduce high-rise littering and pigeon issues, the dedication of the Residents' Committee community leaders to educate residents personally was critical in tackling the root cause – human behaviour. Post-pilot, we saw an 80% reduction in related feedback. We have formalised a programme to equip community leaders and Town Councils in all towns with advice and resources to tackle these issues.We welcome residents to come on board in a variety of ways – as individuals, to inject their unique perspectives, and as a community, to build consensus amid diverse views. For example, MSO is partnering MCCY in the \"Love Our 'Hood\" initiative that test-beds various resident participation models to co-create solutions for municipal issues in their neighbourhoods. Through these projects, we will develop resources that other community groups can use when launching future ground-up initiatives.To sum up, there are many good ideas, diverse talents and new solution possibilities across the community, industry and agencies. We want to harness these to achieve our common goal of improving our living environment, the SG Together way. In 2020, we will remain steadfast in our goal to deliver connected services for a connected community.Mr Chairman: Mr Desmond Lee.The Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee): Chairman, we want to build a Singapore where the next generation can enjoy a better life than the one before. That is why my colleague Minister Lawrence Wong had said some time ago that \"we are not done building Singapore.\" This spirit also motivates our push to make Singapore a City in Nature and our efforts to transform our city centre. So, I will focus on these two aspects today.Sir, the lush urban greenery we have today is the outcome of dedicated and sustained efforts where successive generations of Singaporeans have been planting trees, year after year, over the past 60 years. Today, we are a City in a Garden and, according to an MIT study, one of the world's greenest cities.Mr Arasu Duraisamy asked about the Government's plans for the next bound of greening Singapore. We want to transform Singapore into a City in Nature to provide Singaporeans with a better quality of life while co-existing with flora and fauna on this island. Indeed, with climate change, more extreme weather conditions and increased urbanisation, we must do more on this front.With your permission, Chairman, may I just display some slides on the screen to better elaborate what I am going to say?The Chairman: Yes. [Slides were shown to hon Members.]Mr Desmond Lee: Sir, our key strategy is to enhance and extend our natural capital across the island. Let me outline four key moves over the next 10 years.First, we will extend our nature park network. Today, we have more than 350 hectares of nature parks, which act as complementary habitats and buffers to our nature reserves to protect them from the impact of urbanisation. This is important as the nature reserves are the richest sources of our natural capital. They contain our primary and secondary rainforests and core habitats for our native biodiversity and wildlife.In all, we will dedicate another 200 hectares of nature parks by 2030. This is two-and-a-half times the size of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Singaporeans can look forward to more places, such as the Rifle Range Nature Park for nature-based recreation, such as hiking and bird watching in future.Khatib Bongsu is a rich mangrove and mudflat habitat on the north-eastern coast of Singapore. I have kayaked there with NParks and our nature community volunteers a number of years ago. It is one of the few good mangrove habitats left in Singapore and I am happy to announce that NParks will also be establishing a 40-hectare nature park there.Next, we will intensify nature and the greenery in our gardens and parks.First, we will incorporate natural designs and plantings in our new and redeveloped parks. You can expect to see a greater variety of vegetation that resembles the look and feel of natural forests and also benefit from the positive effects of nature on your health and well-being. You can look forward to the addition of another 140 hectares of such parks and gardens over the next five years.Second, we will naturalise more waterways and water bodies in our gardens and parks. We have done this in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park and Lakeside Garden, where we transformed concrete canals into natural rivers. We will incorporate such designs in all our coastal and riverine parks. This will also help to protect against sea-level rise and flooding.Lastly, we will conserve important native plants and animal species. Some of our world's most unique biodiversity call our tropical island home. Singaporeans would have encountered rare native species, such as the Singapore Kopsia, on the left, and tiger orchid, on the right, and this is because of our restoration efforts. In fact, the tiger orchid is the largest orchid in the world. It can weigh a few tonnes each.We will partner nature groups and the community to carry out recovery plans for over 70 more animal and plant species and enhance 30 hectares of forest, marine and coastal habitats by 2030.Sir, our third strategy is to restore nature into our urban areas to bring greenery closer to our everyday lives, so that Singaporeans benefit from greenery at their doorstep. We aim to nearly double the skyrise greenery footprint in our buildings and infrastructure to 200 hectares by 2030. We will focus on greening our industrial estates. These are amongst some of the hottest areas on the island – hottest in terms of temperature. Over the next 10 years, we will plant 100,000 more trees in industrial estates, such as the Tuas Industrial Estate and Seletar Aerospace Park. These efforts will cool the environment, improve air quality and beautify the surroundings in those industrial estates.Lastly, we will strengthen the connectivity between our green spaces. It is not enough to intensify greenery in isolated pockets. So, we will plant native trees and plants in a multi-tiered structure and create green corridors along roads called Nature Ways.These can be further integrated with pedestrian and cycling paths to form lush and natural park connectors. In fact, we have been planting Nature Ways since 2013 and, by 2030, we aim to have 300 km of Nature Ways and 500 km of park connectors. With these, all households will be within a 10-minute walk from a park and, over the long term, where feasible, we aim to make every road a Nature Way.During a recent dialogue with friends from the nature community, they shared that the work of greening Singapore cannot be done by MND alone and they are quite right. The transformation of Singapore into a City in Nature – a qualitative change – requires close collaboration with other agencies and we will infuse this into our planning and development systems.But Government efforts alone will not be sufficient. Various Members also asked how Singaporeans can be more involved in the greening of Singapore. We want a whole new generation of Singaporeans to carry on this responsibility to keep planting and nurturing trees for the benefit of future Singaporeans.Mr Lee Kuan Yew sowed the seeds of Singapore's greening movement with the planting of a Mempat Tree in 1963 at a time when the Government was also grappling with serious challenges of unemployment, public health, illiteracy and so on. But greening, to our pioneers, was serious business back then, and it remains a key priority of national development right till today.A few years ago, I organised a Nature Way planting in Jurong West. I was standing next to an elderly lady, who was there with her grandson, and they were participating with neighbours and friends in planting the Nature Way. It was along one of the roads. After they had shovelled soil around their sapling, I could not help but overhear this elderly lady asking someone to help her take a photograph of her and her grandson next to the sapling. She told her grandson in Mandarin, \"Boy, let us take a photo. Remember where we planted this tree. Next time, when Ah Ma is gone, come and visit the tree with your family. It will surely be a lot taller by then. You can remember me by that tree.\"This story stuck deep in me about how our greenery can bind Singaporeans and families in Singapore together, and how one generation takes it upon itself to plant trees for the next generation to enjoy. Literally planting trees for the next generation but also figuratively taking responsibility for the long term, not just for ourselves, but for the future.We want this DNA to run deep in our future generations. So, we will continue this legacy with a new movement – the One Million Trees movement.Today, we plant around the order of 50,000 trees a year. We will double the pace and plant one million trees over the next 10 years. We will do so along our roads, in our parks, estates and green areas, and along some of our coastal areas, we will plant mangrove trees. We may lose some streetscape greenery due to developmental needs, but we will plant back what is lost and more.I recently met with a number of partners, who are passionate about greening, to discuss how this One Million Trees movement can galvanise the length and breadth of Singapore, and bring on-board a broad spectrum of Singapore, especially the next generation, to have a stake in greening Singapore, to have a stake in making sure this place remains liveable, not just for themselves but for the next generation.We will involve schools, communities, corporate organisations and many more. In fact, more than 200 stakeholders have already pledged their support to plant more than 120,000 trees. This includes companies on Jurong Island, Keppel Corporation, the National University of Singapore, OCBC, Shimizu Corporation, United Parcel Service (UPS) and many other community groups, organisations and individuals. I am encouraged to see that everyone is doing their part to keep Singapore green.We also want Singaporeans to be more actively involved in the design, development and programming of our parks. Over the next five years, Singaporeans can join in the designing, building and management of 50 new and redeveloped parks, as my colleague Minister Lawrence Wong had announced recently. This includes signage design or promoting park etiquette, and partnering our gardeners to do landscape planting. It is one thing for a park to be built near you; it is another for a park to be built near you in which you have had a hand in designing, conceptualising, building and literally knocking the nails into some of the furniture for the park and planting the trees. It also gives a sense of ownership, custodianship and stewardship of the green spaces around you.We will also step up efforts to build awareness amongst Singaporeans so that we can live harmoniously with nature. To have 48,000 NParks volunteers working closely and passionately with us today is something we are very proud of, and we hope to grow this number to some 70,000 over the next 10 years. We invite you to join in our efforts, forge closer bonds with fellow Singaporeans and strengthen our sense of ownership of our environment.Sir, even as we enhance the quality of our green spaces, we will energise and rejuvenate our city.Various Members asked about on-going efforts to rejuvenate our CBD and the city and progress of MND's work over the year.We aspire to be amongst the leading cities in the world, where people want to live, work and visit. We have introduced the CBD Incentive Scheme for this purpose. A successful CBD must have a good mix of office spaces, a lively street life, with diverse offerings. To encourage the development of different neighbourhoods in the CBD, we introduced incentives for the conversion of older office buildings into residences and hotels. Interest and take-up have been encouraging and URA planners are working with interested building owners on this.6.00 pmWe have also introduced the Strategic Development Incentive Scheme to encourage commercial building owners to partner neighbours to comprehensively redevelop a few plots, where transformation is not limited to one building but a whole area along the street or precinct for the public to enjoy.URA is in dialogue with several building owners who are keen with potential to rejuvenate different parts of our city.But a leading city is nothing without its people and its soul – not just about buildings and shops, but one that reflects the Singaporean attitude of innovation, openness, daring and verve. Deputy Prime Minister Heng spoke about the spirit of partnership at the launch of the Singapore Together movement last year. At MND we embrace it and will do more to partner Singaporeans. Members have asked how we intend to do so.We have private sector partners from 10 precincts all across Singapore on the pilot Business Improvement District programme (BID). The pilot BID programmes are making good progress. These stakeholders seek to take a people-centred approach in creating spaces that will draw people into them. For example, we saw The Lawn next to The Sail and Marina Bay Financial Centre being activated for the first time during the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown, and so expect many more such new initiatives in the coming year and months.Community feedback was key throughout the Draft Master Plan 2019 process. This is another example of how Singaporeans get involved in rejuvenating our city. We exhibited the plan in March 2019 after rounds of consultation, and gazetted it eight months later. We assessed each public feedback thoroughly, and incorporated ideas and suggestions where appropriate. I am confident that the plan has been made better because of our collective efforts and because Singaporeans cared and participated.Members asked about heritage and conservation of buildings to maintain the character of a city. As a city-state, we have to meet the national physical needs while retaining links to our past, retaining links to our national collective memory. And to-date, after a 30-year journey, we have conserved close to 7,200 buildings across our island, with some in the heartlands. Recent additions include the former Bukit Timah Fire Station, former Railway Station Staff Quarters and SCGS campus at Emerald Hill. In our conservation efforts, partnerships are key. And in the case of SCGS, a group of alumnae worked with stakeholders and the public to garner support for conservation.We also engage industry partners and the stakeholders in determining which building to conserve, and how we can sustain the built heritage of places.Sir, in the next bound of greening Singapore and energising our city, it is partnerships that are key – the commitment by Singaporeans across all walks of life to work together with us to imagine the next Singapore, to work hand-in-hand to keep our city green, to keep our city lively and buzzing.Apart from partnerships, we also have to thank many of our colleagues and officers who work assiduously behind the scenes to make this a reality. For example, the aborists, conservationists, botanists, scientists in NParks and Gardens by the Bay who dream of a yet more green Singapore and the city planners and innovators who think of ways to energise community partnerships in order to make our city that much more vibrant and exciting. We look forward to continued partnership with Members of this House as well. [Applause.]The Chairman: Mr Zaqy Mohamad.The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad): Chairman, may I show some slides at appropriate junctures, please?The Chairman: Yes. [Slides were shown to hon Members.]The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad): As we continue to remake our city, we must ensure that our firms and our workers in the Built Environment sector keep pace with technological advancements, improve their capabilities and seize upcoming opportunities.In 2017, we developed the Construction Industry Transformation Map or ITM, with the industry, the unions, and IHLs.We have made good progress in our three ITM transformation areas, namely, Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA), Integrated Digital Delivery (IDD) and Green Buildings. Allow me to elaborate.Firstly, we are fundamentally changing the way that we build through DfMA. DfMA allows us to move on-site construction work into a more controlled working environment off-site, to prefabricate building components for on-site assembly. This way, construction becomes faster, cleaner, quieter, and of higher quality.For example, Teambuild, a local builder, achieved close to 37% site productivity gains for its Valley Spring @Yishun, a HDB BTO project by adopting Prefabricated Pre-finished Volumetric Construction (PPVC). Here, you can see a module being lifted, to be assembled just like Lego blocks, with the furnishings already fitted inside. This enabled Teambuild significant time savings, and we hope to drive greater adoption in the near future.We are on track to meet our DfMA adoption target of 40% this year, and we aim to achieve an even higher rate of 70% by 2025. Now, this is an ambitious target but I think that we can achieve this by working together with the industry. We aim to make DfMA our default way of building.Mr Ong Teng Koon asked how our construction productivity compares with other countries. Site productivity data is not available for all countries. However, our site productivity has improved by over 17% in the last decade, which is significant.To boost DfMA adoption, we enhanced our Buildability Framework last year, raising standards for larger residential developments and allowing outcome-based solutions to encourage building designs that can be constructed more productively.We will further enhance the framework this year, by progressively requiring higher buildability standards for other development types, including commercial and institutional buildings. We will also re-structure the framework to encourage the industry to incorporate DfMA technology into the structural, architectural and Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing designs for buildings.The public sector will also continue to generate lead demand for DfMA. To this end, we will set aside $120 million under the Public Sector Construction Productivity Fund for more public sector projects to adopt DfMA, for projects launched by 2021.Next on IDD. The digitalisation of the construction process will facilitate wider deployment of DfMA technologies. Building Information Modelling, or BIM technology, will allow our architects and engineers to design and build in a virtual setting first. This improves the accuracy of construction plans and reduces abortive works downstream. Now IDD takes this further, by leveraging technology to facilitate better collaboration amongst project parties across the building life-cycle, to coordinate production and supply chains, to build more efficiently, to improve building quality and to optimise operations and maintenance.For example, Guan Ho, a home-grown construction firm, has been using digital technology to track building components as they are fabricated, delivered and installed at Punggol Town Hub. This has reduced time spent on project management by up to 30%. We want more local firms to use IDD to build smarter and more efficiently.To help our local SMEs with IDD, BCA, IMDA and SkillsFuture Singapore have developed the Construction and Facilities Management Industry Digital Plan. We will set aside $19 million to fund SMEs to adopt digital solutions that complement basic BIM software. SMEs will be guided to assess their level of digital readiness, and identify digital solutions that can benefit businesses. For example, site management platforms to plan and monitor construction activities, and facilities management software for operations and maintenance. SMEs can receive up to 70% funding for pre-approved solutions. SMEs can also use the Digital Roadmap on Training to identify digitalisation courses for employees.Moving on to green buildings. Our industry transformation efforts are not limited to improving productivity. As Deputy Prime Minister emphasised during the Budget, we must remake our city to meet the challenges of climate change. Buildings account for over 20% of our emissions. Green buildings are hence an important part of Singapore’s climate change mitigation strategy. Since the launch of BCA’s Green Mark scheme in 2005, we have greened more than 40% of our buildings by GFA. We are on track to meet our target of 80% by 2030. We also launched the Super Low Energy buildings programme in 2018, which goes beyond Green Mark Platinum standards.To share an example – Keppel Land and BCA are working together to transform the Keppel Bay Tower into a Super Low Energy building. The building uses innovative technologies, including a high-efficiency air distribution system and autonomous lighting control, to reduce energy consumption by about 20%. This is a good example of how existing buildings can achieve Super Low Energy standards. Keppel Bay Tower will be the first commercial building fully powered by renewable energy.We can do more. Over the next few months, BCA will co-create the Singapore Green Building Masterplan 2020 with our stakeholders, as we push the boundaries for Green Buildings.We are considering a few initiatives. First, to push for more energy efficient buildings, we intend to raise the minimum energy performance standards. This will lower emissions, and also benefit building owners over the building life-cycle. Concurrently, we will review our Green Mark certification standards, as highlighted by Mr Louis Ng. BCA will engage stakeholders to develop shared aspirations for sustainability standards in the Built Environment, and we need to work out how to get there in partnership.Next, we want to enable greater transparency in building energy performance. Today, close to 80% of commercial building owners voluntarily opt to disclose their buildings' names and addresses along with their energy performance data, which is published by BCA annually. We intend to identify all buildings when publishing the data henceforth, so that the best performing buildings will serve as role models to encourage others to improve their own energy efficiency. We will share more details by this year.We call on stakeholders to co-create the Singapore Green Building Masterplan 2020 with us over the next few months.Beyond improving firms’ capabilities, transforming the construction sector is also about creating more opportunities for our people, as Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Ong Teng Koon mentioned.The adoption of new technologies and digitalisation has created new, higher-skilled jobs in better working environments in the construction sector, and generally they will command higher salaries. For example, with DfMA, we will need more production managers, quality assurance personnel, and logistics and supply chain planners at automated production facilities. Tech-savvy local PMETs can also take on exciting jobs such as digital delivery specialists along with the others in the IDD value chain that I mentioned earlier.Our sector should be anchored by a skilled and competent local workforce and our firms must also do their part. The share of local PMETs in construction has fallen over the past decade, even though our total local PMET population has increased.To rebalance the share of local PMETs in construction, Deputy Prime Minister has announced a reduction in the construction S Pass sub-DRC from 20% currently to 18% in January 2021, and subsequently to 15% in January 2023.To help firms build up a strong local core, we are strengthening measures to ensure an adequate pipeline of skilled local PMETs for the industry. BCA and IHLs continually update the curricula of Built Environment courses to meet the industry's evolving needs. BCA also co-sponsors scholarship and sponsorship programmes with the industry to attract students to pursue relevant courses in our IHLs.We will also progressively introduce new Professional Conversion Programmes or PCPs, to prepare mid-career entrants to join the sector. For example, a PMET from manufacturing could be re-skilled as a production manager in a DfMA facility. Hence, we will develop PCPs for prefabrication job roles. Teambuild is developing a firm-level PCP, which will be open for applications later this year.I have also heard feedback about the shortage of BIM modellers, but firms have not been keen to take in mid-career converts before they are trained. Under the current BIM PCP, participants are trained in BIM while concurrently undergoing on-the-job-training with their firms. But some firms prefer BIM modellers who can contribute immediately upon hiring. To address this, we will allow participants to complete their full-time training first, before continuing with on-the-job training with their firms. So, on a full-time basis; they could be ready within three months instead of six or 12 months if they were doing it part-time. We hope that more firms will take up the enhanced BIM PCP, which will start later this year. For the participants, they will receive an allowance of up to 80% of their drawn salary is, during their full-time training.To Er Dr Lee Bee Wah's and Mr Ong Teng Koon's points on the S Pass sub-DRC cuts, our transformation efforts have created attractive jobs for locals. The S Pass tightening helps level the playing field, and will allow more Polytechnic and ITE graduates to access these jobs, including supervisory roles. Our local PMETs will still be able to take on supervisory roles, so long as they are open to re-skilling themselves.6.15 pmAs we push ahead with our transformation efforts, we aim to create more of these attractive jobs that I shared earlier, for our local PMETs. I encourage firms to take advantage of our good pipeline of infrastructure projects in the years ahead and attract more local PMETs to join our sector.A good example is Kimly Construction. Since 2015, Kimly has sponsored 15 undergraduates with BCA, and introduced them to fulfilling careers in the Built Environment sector. Kimly has also groomed three mid-career BIM modellers under the BIM PCP since 2018. Kimly paced out the on-the-job-training for these employees to smoothen their transition into the firm, and they are now keen to pick up even more advanced BIM skills, such as 4D/5D BIM simulation.We have also developed a Skills Framework (SFw) for the Built Environment sector, to map out skillsets required at various levels for key job roles in the construction and facilities management sectors, and their career progression pathways. More details will be announced later this year.Moving on to other cuts. Ms Sylvia Lim asked about ensuring the safety of building works.For any development, the Qualified Person or QP has a duty to ensure that building and structural plans comply with the building control regulations. In addition, all major building works must be independently reviewed by an Accredited Checker or AC to ensure that the key structural elements are adequately designed.While the responsibility of ensuring structural safety rests with the QP and AC, BCA conducts sampling checks for each plan submission. Where BCA finds non-compliance with legislative requirements, BCA will take enforcement action. Penalties could include a fine, or imprisonment, or both.BCA regularly reviews the Building Control regime to ensure that it is sufficiently robust. BCA has introduced additional requirements since 2017, after the Tampines viaduct incident that Ms Lim mentioned, to raise our standards of building safety. BCA now requires the QPs and builders of higher risk projects to provide additional detailed assessments on the stability of the structure.Together with the Institution of Engineers Singapore or IES, and the Association of Consulting Engineers Singapore or ACES, BCA has issued two circulars in 2019 to provide QPs and ACs with guidelines and good practices for plan submissions and supervision. This will help QPs and ACs to improve the quality of their design calculations and ensure that all key structural elements of the project are identified, as well as improve the quality of the QPs' supervision. So, measures have been in place since then and we hope that this will improve the safety record of builders, moving forward.Er Dr Lee also spoke about supporting local contractors. Singapore cannot discriminate against foreign firms, in line with our WTO obligations. Indeed, we have been helping local firms to build capabilities as well as strengthen their competitiveness. One way we have done so is by parcelling large Government projects, such as MRT lines, into smaller contracts, so that our local firms are able to take up projects while the Government mitigates its risk.In recent years, I am also pleased to see more local firms winning large infrastructure projects. For example, Woh Hup won a $1 billion contract to develop an Integrated Business Park at Punggol Digital District. Straits Construction, another local builder, was part of a joint venture that won the $537 million contract for the Singapore Institute of Technology.Er Dr Lee also spoke about payment delays due to Variation Orders, or VOs. BCA and MOF have encouraged GPEs to process VOs progressively and expeditiously, to ensure timely payments to contractors.We empathise with the current situation and will certainly help where needed. For example, agencies can process VOs based on indicative scope andcosts. At the same time, contractors should include the necessary documentation to support speedy processing of claims. More recently, we have revised the Security of Payment Act or SOPA, which aims to also help claims for private sector projects.If Er Dr Lee can share more details with us, including the treatment of Liquidated Damages (LDs) and progress payments, BCA will look into these specific cases.Let me conclude by addressing concerns from the construction sector arising from COVID-19. BCA has advised government agencies to take a sympathetic view when considering Extension of Time or EOT requests, for project delays due to COVID-19. We have also sought REDAS' support for private sector developers to do likewise. We will continue to monitor the situation. If delays are prolonged, we will consider whether additional measures are necessary.To ease cashflow concerns from delays due to COVID-19, main contractors can also submit progress payment claims fortnightly instead of monthly, for public sector projects. So, we are trying to help firms with their cashflow too.For on-going PPVC projects affected by delays to the supply of construction materials from China, BCA has adopted a facilitative approach so far. We have allowed 13 projects to install partially completed PPVC modules on-site first, and install the finishing works subsequently when the delayed materials arrive. So, we have also provided some flexibility in some of our projects.Some firms with more PRC workers may also face manpower pressure in the short term due to COVID-19. These firms may consider hiring workers from other firms with excess foreign manpower. Firms can search for eligible workers for transfer via the Foreign Construction Workers Directory System or FCWDS, online.Built Environment firms can also tap on the support packages announced by Deputy Prime Minister earlier, such as the SME Working Capital Loan under the Enhanced Enterprise Financing Scheme, and the Jobs Support Scheme.Er Dr Lee also suggested measures to help developers and contractors cope with COVID-19. On foreign worker levies, the Minister for Manpower already said during the Budget debate last week that we are waiving levies for employers with eligible foreign workers serving quarantine leave of absence or stay home notices.However, we have not done so for all foreign workers in general. As much as we want to help the sector or businesses deal with the short-term fall-out, this should not negate longer term efforts for companies to restructure and become less reliant on foreign manpower. Levy waivers would run counter to these objectives.Er Dr Lee and Mr Alex Yam also asked about the Project Completion Period and the ABSD remission timelines. The Government is monitoring the construction industry and the property market closely. We will adjust our policies as necessary to ensure a stable and sustainable property market. We have selectively allowed extensions of the completion period for individual projects because of extenuating circumstances, and would be prepared to consider doing so on a case-by-case basis.But to assure the industry, we have seen just a few appeals, so it is not a big impact thus far. We will continue to monitor the situation and see how it goes.Even as we deal with the immediate challenges posed by COVID-19, we should not lose sight of our longer term transformation agenda. I strongly encourage firms to tap on the schemes available under our $780 million BuildSG Transformation Fund, so that we can all emerge stronger and better prepared for the future.In closing, we have made good progress, but there is certainly much more that we can do. We will accelerate our efforts to build more productively, create more opportunities for our firms and good jobs for our people.The Chairman: Ms Sun Xueling.The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Ms Sun Xueling): Mr Chairman, I would like to begin by thanking all Members who have spoken up about animal health and welfare. Kindly allow me to share how we will continue to work closely with the community on these issues.First, one of our key strategies is to reduce the stray animal population and re-home as many as possible, where they will have shelter, food, and adequate care.I am happy to say that we have made good progress with the Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage (TNRM) programme. Launched in partnership with 11 Animal Welfare Groups (AWGs), it involves catching and sterilising stray dogs, or Singapore Specials, as we call them, to sustainably and humanely manage their population. We will then rehome as many of the sterilised dogs as possible, while the remaining dogs will be released at suitable locations to live out their lives naturally.Since the programme was launched, NParks and the AWGs have worked closely with the community as well as land owners on the ground to trap about 1,000 dogs. Thus far, we have managed to rehome or foster over half of the dogs trapped under TNRM, and we hope to rehome even more Singapore Specials in the coming years.Eight years ago, we worked with our AWG partners to launch Project ADORE to do this. Given the good progress, NParks has recently reviewed the size limits for Project ADORE. I thank Mr Louis Ng for his proposal to further re-look the height limit for Project ADORE. NParks will work closely with our AWG partners to successfully implement the latest revision first before we review the project again. It bears mentioning that Project ADORE has been successful largely because of careful, sensitive and gradual implementation. NParks has to balance the objective of rehoming more dogs with the concerns that some residents have over larger dogs in HDB flats.In addition, I would like to share that public feedback on stray dogs has decreased by more than 50% since the launch of TNRM. This is the result of the hard work by our AWGs and NParks officers in terms of outreach on the ground.The second thrust of our work is on increased education and outreach efforts. NParks, in collaboration with our AWGs and pet businesses, launched the Pets’ Day Out series in August 2019. It has provided NParks more opportunities to reach out to and educate pet owners or those interested to own pets.We will continue to identify other suitable platforms, such as community events, to reach out to diverse audience groups and garner stronger support from the community.Third, NParks embarked on a review to raise standards in the pet sector. As part of the review, NParks has engaged key stakeholders and the wider public through focus group discussions as well as an online survey.There was general consensus that more needs to be done to raise the standards of pet breeders and boarders to safeguard the health and welfare of the animals involved. Based on the feedback received, NParks intends to take a balanced, risk-based approach to regulating these businesses. Currently, only commercial breeders and boarders on farmland are licensed.For a start, NParks will focus on improving practices at existing commercial breeding facilities on farmland as the breeding sector deals with young and pregnant animals that require specialised care. This will be done by strengthening the licence conditions in areas such as housing and management, healthcare, and traceability of the animals.Concurrently, NParks will step up its enforcement efforts against those who operate a commercial breeding facility without a licence, outside of farmland.NParks also intends to license commercial pet boarding facilities based on the scale of their operations, which will depend on factors such as the number of animals handled and the frequency of transactions. Those who help board animals for family and friends, or do it infrequently, will not be subject to licensing.Regardless, all pet service providers, including pet boarders and breeders, have a duty of care towards the animals they handle and they should abide by the Code of Animal Welfare for the Pet Industry. Beyond the Code of Animal Welfare, NParks can take enforcement action against pet service providers under the Animals and Birds Act for failing in this duty of care, or for animal cruelty. NParks will work through the revised regulatory framework with stakeholders and share more details later this year.Mr Yee Chia Hsing spoke about using the IUCN Red List to regulate the pet bird trade. Let me clarify that the IUCN list is already part of our considerations. This is because we regulate wildlife trade according to the requirements of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which uses IUCN conservation status as one of the criteria for categorising species.Furthermore, the penalties for illegal smuggling under the Animals and Birds Act apply per animal or bird, and not per shipment. This means that a smuggler may be liable on conviction to a fine of up to $10,000 or 12 months’ jail or both for each smuggled bird, which should be a sufficient deterrent.6.30 pmNParks' public consultations on the pet sector review also surfaced the need to enhance the traceability of animals. A robust animal traceability system is critical in protecting public and animal health. In the event a pet is diagnosed with an infectious disease, especially one which can be transmitted to humans, such as rabies, it is important to be able to trace its whereabouts and health status.Pet licensing is one of the measures that enables NParks to do so quickly. To make it more convenient for pet owners, NParks will introduce a one-time licensing for sterilised dogs by the end of the year. With one-time licensing, owners of sterilised dogs only need to apply to NParks for a licence once, instead of having to repeatedly renew their licence upon expiry. The licence, with a one-time fee of $35, will be valid throughout the life of the dog. This means that if you sterilise your dog and opt for a one-time licence instead of an annual licence, you could save over $800 in licence fees over 10 years. We hope that this will encourage more owners to sterilise and license their pet dogs. For existing owners with three-year licences for sterilised dogs, you will be happy to hear that your licences will automatically be changed to a one-time licence.As part of its pet sector review, NParks is also looking into measures to enhance cat traceability to protect public health.We are also looking into raising the standards of the veterinary industry. Our veterinarians play an important role in providing animals with high standards of care and ensuring animal health. They also play a critical role in safeguarding public health as they can help detect the outbreak of diseases that may be transmitted to humans. NParks will begin engaging key stakeholders on this issue in April this year.These are just some of the areas that we have been working on in a relatively short span of time. And there are many other areas that the community has raised, which we are continuing to study and finding ways to balance the needs of the community. For instance, the issue of cat ownership in HDB flats, which Assoc Prof Daniel Goh and Mr Louis Ng have raised.We recognise that there are residents who are cat lovers and who would like to keep cats in their flats. We are continuing to have conversations around how to best strike a balance between residents who are pet lovers, those who are not and those who are concerned about disamenities. HDB will work with NParks to take a holistic and balanced approach in reviewing and updating its pet ownership policies.Let me now speak about our efforts to help low-income and rental households.Last year, I shared about our plans to improve the natural lighting and ventilation in older rental blocks, by removing some flats on each floor to create more openings along the corridors.This year, HDB will commence the improvement works at Chai Chee and Telok Blangah. At these four blocks, all tenants who are living in the units identified for removal can relocate within the same block, if they prefer. HDB and local social organisations are closely supporting their transition. HDB will study where else they can implement similar improvements in future, considering feedback from residents.Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Dr Lily Neo asked about reviewing the Joint Singles Scheme (JSS). Most JSS tenants are prepared to share a flat. More than 90% of flat-sharing tenants surveyed did not experience conflicts or difficulties living with their flatmate. Nevertheless, HDB will facilitate requests from tenants who wish to transfer to another flat with a different flatmate. For those with extenuating circumstances or medical grounds, HDB is also prepared to consider their requests to rent alone.Further, HDB has also been installing partitions in 1-room rental flats for JSS tenants, to provide more privacy for each individual. Some of these are also installed such that there are internal doors to each sleeping area.HDB currently has about 1,100 rental flats with partitions. About half of these are vacant and available to JSS households.While most of the flats were fitted with partitions while vacant, about 50 flats had partitions installed in-situ, at the request of tenants who are already living there. This in-situ installation was a new offer we rolled out last year. Interested tenants can contact their local HDB branch to request for partitions.Apart from physical enhancements, we have also enhanced the support for tenants to become homeowners.Last year, I announced that HDB will waive any subsequent rent increase for tenants who have made a downpayment for a new flat.Since the implementation of this waiver on 1 June 2019, close to 200 rental households have benefited. The median amount of rent saved by these families is about $150 per month, which they can put towards their upcoming new home, or other needs.On Mr Gan Thiam Poh's suggestion to treat the rent paid as instalments for a future flat purchase, we have not done so as it is similar to giving the tenant a housing grant, which we already do through various schemes. Grants are also more equitable as the amount of subsidy would not vary with the tenants' length of stay in rental housing. Our rental rates are tiered progressively based on income, to ensure that subsidies are allocated fairly, and targeted at those who need them most.To mitigate the cliff effect at each tier, on a case-by-case basis, HDB waives the rent increase at tenancy renewal if it is a significant part of the household's increase in income. In the last three years, about 5,500 households have benefited from these waivers, which are intended to encourage households to continue increasing their income.Beyond providing financial help, we have also intensified our efforts in other ways. We formed the Home ownership Support Team (HST) last year, to work closely with families towards home ownership. The team is advising nearly 280 families and will guide them through when they are ready for home ownership.In the last three years, about 3,200 rental households have moved into their own homes. Another 2,000 have booked a flat and are awaiting the completion of their new homes.While these numbers may not seem large, the progress has been steady over the last few years. As the Malay saying goes, \"sikit-sikit, lama-lama jadi bukit.\" This means \"bit by bit, and over time, a little becomes a lot\". Every family is important to us and we will continue to support our tenants towards home ownership.The Chairman: Minister Lawrence Wong.The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong): Mr Chairman, as we tackle the on-going COVID-19 outbreak and its economic fallout, we are reminded once again of how small and vulnerable Singapore is and how exposed we are to external forces beyond our control.But I am confident that Singaporeans will rise to the occasion. We are a resilient people, we have always faced tough odds, and we have confronted many difficult challenges before, in our nation's short history. And each time, the Government and the citizens rally together; we deal with the issues head-on; and we emerge stronger and surer of what we can achieve together.Take housing as an example. Sixty years ago, this was one of the most pressing issues on the Government’s agenda. We had a major housing crisis. Many Singaporeans lived in overcrowded slums, and the living conditions were appalling. The British could not solve the problem. They said it was not possible to build so many flats in such a short period of time. But we proved them wrong.HDB was formed in 1960. It quickly ramped up the building of flats and addressed the acute housing shortage.My family is a beneficiary – my grandfather was a fisherman who lived in a kampong in Tanjong Rhu in the 1950s, and later when his children grew up and married, many were able to move out and purchase their own HDB flats, like my parents who got their flat in Marine Parade in the 1970s. Likewise, many in my generation have benefited and now, I see the next generation, my nieces and nephews, getting married and purchasing their own HDB flats. One just managed to get a flat in Bidadari and he is very happy.Singaporeans all over the island will be able to share similar stories. Through home ownership, we have a tangible stake in our country and a share in our nation's progress. Through public housing, we all grow up together, regardless of backgrounds, and we forge a stronger sense of community and common identity.Today, HDB flats are an integral part of our Singaporean way of life. There are now more than one million HDB flats, home to about 80% of our resident households. And of these, nine in 10 own their homes.Enabling home ownership through HDB has been one of our most successful social policies. Many have called it one of the most successful public housing programmes enacted anywhere in the world.For this we have to thank generations of MND and HDB officers, past and present, who have worked hard to make all this happen. So, we have much to be grateful for when we look back at what we have achieved together. But we must never be complacent, and that is why we are always looking for ways to make HDB living even better. So, let me touch on three areas.First, it is our evergreen mission to keep public housing affordable and accessible, so that every Singaporean household can have a home to call their own. That is why we continue to sell HDB flats at heavily subsidised prices and provide generous housing grants on top of that. In particular, with the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) introduced last year, first-timer families can enjoy a grant of up to $80,000 for a new flat. If they buy a resale flat, they can get up to double the amount, or $160,000, in grants.These considerable subsidies keep HDB flats affordable. Today, HDB flat prices remain at less than five times of median household income. You cannot find such affordable housing in any other major city in the world. The ratio, the house price to income ratio, is nearly 10 times in London, Los Angeles and Sydney. In Hong Kong, it is more than 20 times.Our affordability benchmark goes beyond the median income. Take the example of a first-timer couple with monthly income of $5,000, which is near the 30thpercentile of resident household income. They can buy a 4-room flat in a non-mature estate at a subsidised price of $330,000 and they will receive $45,000 in grants. So, inclusive of grants, the flat willcost less than five times their annual income.The grants can be used to pay the down-payment. So, effectively, they need zero upfront cash. Then, they take a 25-year housing loan and their monthly mortgage is paid largely with their CPF savings, with little or zero cash outlay.That is our basic commitment to every generation of Singaporeans. It is a housing commitment not just to the higher or middle income groups but we will also ensure that lower income Singaporeans benefit. Like the example I gave just now, even first-timers at the 30th percentile of household income, can purchase a new 4-room flat in a non-mature estate and service their housing loan with zero or very little cash outlay.So, for the vast majority of first-timers, the Singapore dream of being able to own your own home remains secure. We will make sure of that both now and in the future.Of course, we also want to have more affordable flats in the mature estates and a wider range of flat options to choose from, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Chong Kee Hiong both spoke about this. But it is more challenging to do so in mature estates, due to the limited space for new flats in these estates. In some prime locations, the prices of resale HDB flats are beyond the reach of many young couples just starting out in life.And if this trend continues, it will mean that certain public housing estates can potentially become exclusive areas that only a few can afford and then this will lead to greater social stratification. So, we do have to do something about this. We cannot resolve this issue through our existing model of HDB flats.And that is why I have shared earlier that MND is working on a new model for BTO flats in prime locations. The basic idea is to sell these flats at more affordable prices, but the flats will come with tighter conditions imposed. This is a major change which we are studying and thinking through very carefully, as it will also have an impact on the resale market. We will continue to review it and we will share more details in the coming year when we are ready.Besides affordability, we will also help Singaporeans to access their flats more quickly. Several Members like Mr Chong Kee Hiong and Mr Mohamed Irshad spoke about this.6.45 pmWe will continually review and improve our sales processes to achieve this. For new BTO flats, we give priority for those looking for their first home. That is why virtually all first-timer families have been successful within their first three tries for a BTO flat in a non-mature estate. We have also introduced BTO flats with shorter waiting times of two to three years, because we bring forward the construction.Since last year, we have started sharing information on upcoming BTO sites six months in advance instead of just three months. We will try to do more, as suggested by Mr Gan Thiam Poh, but I am afraid it is not so easy to project forward for more than six months. It will be challenging to share this information too far in advance because there may well be unexpected changes along the way.Some households may need a flat more urgently. That is why we also offer balance flats for sale, many of which are completed or near completion. Today, we have the Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) and, if there are still unselected flats after the SBF, we pool all of them together and we release them through what we call the Re-Offer of Balance Flats (ROF) exercises.The initial take-up of the ROF flats has been positive. But we have received feedback and requests for the ROF to be done more frequently instead of just twice a year. So, last year, we tried putting out some of these unselected flats on an open booking system for people to apply all year round.Now that we have some experience with this open booking system, we are ready to extend it further. So, we will do away with the standalone ROF exercises and, instead, the unselected SBF flats, after the SBF exercise, will be pooled and offered directly for open booking right away, without going through another round of balloting. This will enable home-seekers with urgent needs to access flats more quickly.Effectively, with this change, there will be three main ways of applying for an HDB flat. With your permission, Mr Chairman, may I display some slides on the screen?The Chairman: Yes. [Slides were shown to hon Members.]Mr Lawrence Wong: So, you can go for BTO flats – new flats which will be released four times a year, you can apply for a balance flat which will be put out twice a year, or you can go for open booking and apply online at almost any time of the year. So, that is our first priority to ensure affordability and accessibility of flats.Second, we also support the diverse housing needs of different segments of Singaporeans. For needy households without other housing options or family support, we continue to provide them with public rental housing. Over the years, HDB has steadily increased the public rental supply. The waiting time is now less than two months for applicants who are not particular about location. For those who want specific locations, the waiting time may be longer, depending on availability of units in that particular area.Several Members, including Ms Anthea Ong, Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Dr Lily Neo, asked for bigger rental units and dedicated units for single tenants, and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sun Xueling has also explained our thinking on this matter. We would, in fact, very much like to accommodate all of these requests. The key constraint we have is one of land supply.We have to ensure that demand for both new rental and new sold flats in Singapore can be met on a sustainable basis, not just today, but over the coming decade and beyond. That is actually getting harder and harder to do as our island gets more built up. So, we do need to take a pragmatic approach.For single tenants, as Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sun has said just now, most are prepared to share and are able to live in a rental flat together. For the few with medical conditions, we are prepared to consider their requests on an exceptional basis and allow them to stay in a rental flat by themselves.For families, especially with children, the majority already live in our 2-room rental flats and, for very large families, we do our best to accommodate them. For example, for multi-nuclear families, we can offer them two rental units in the same block. On a case-by-case basis, we will be prepared to offer larger families a 3-room rental flat.Ms Anthea Ong made the point about occupancy caps and I should clarify that these are caps imposed on HDB owners renting out their flats and the tenants who are renting these flats. The occupancy caps do not apply to family members living together, be it in their own flat or a public rental flat.At the same time, we will continue to support public rental tenants towards home ownership. Several Members also spoke about this, including Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Arasu Duraisamy and Dr Lily Neo. We have announced several measures on this last year and the Senior Parliamentary Secretary has shared the progress on these initiatives.For divorcees, we understand and recognise that their housing transitions can be stressful. To ease this process, we now allow divorcees to apply for flats earlier, once their Interim Judgment has settled matters concerning the children and matrimonial flat. But some concerns still remain. For example, Mr Louis Ng spoke about divorcees who are awarded shared care and control of a single child but are unable to agree on who can list the child in their flat application. We understand that such agreement is not always possible, especially if the divorce was acrimonious. When this happens, HDB will be prepared to consider waiving the mutual agreement requirement, if there is clear evidence that one party has already moved on.Another group is unwed parents. Several Members also spoke about this, including Mr Seah Kian Peng, Mr Arasu Duraisamy and Mr Mohamed Irshad. We do want to ensure that their children have a stable home to grow up in. So, we will assist all unwed parents who approach HDB with their housing needs. For such cases, HDB will assess their situation holistically because their circumstances vary.Some Members did raise the point that such a case-by-case approach may cause more uncertainty amongst the applicants because they do not know whether their applications will be successful. So, let me clarify the approach that HDB takes. Essentially, there are two broad approaches.First, for those who are in stable employment and who can afford to buy a flat, then HDB will allow them to buy a flat – not just a new 2-room flat but also a larger 3-room flat in a non-mature estate. Next, for those who have insufficient finances and need a place to stay, then we will continue to consider them for public rental if this is in their child's best interests, taking into account inputs from social workers, if necessary.Yet another group that we support is our seniors. Many of them have their own homes but they are concerned about retirement savings. So, we will try to help them unlock the value of their flat if they need to in several ways. They can rent out their flat or spare bedrooms, they can right-size to a smaller flat, or they can sell a part of their lease to HDB under the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS).We recognise that more needs to be done to help Singaporeans understand these different options, especially LBS, because it is relatively new and also because we have just recently extended the scheme to 5-room and larger flats, something that Mr Alex Yam, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Arasu Duraisamy highlighted. That is why we have been stepping up our public dialogues and engagements and I am glad to note that LBS take-up has doubled from 800 households in 2018 to 1,600 last year.Through these engagements, we also receive feedback and ideas on how our schemes can be improved. One feedback is that the schemes can be quite complex and we can simplify them further. This is particularly the case for the Silver Housing Bonus (SHB), which comes with several conditions. So, having studied the matter, we have decided to simplify and enhance the SHB in three ways.First, we will remove the requirement that seniors must sell a larger flat and buy a smaller flat. Regardless of the type of flat they sell, seniors can apply for the SHB as long as they buy a 3-room or smaller flat and get some proceeds from the move. So, effectively, someone staying in a 3-room flat in a mature estate who wishes to move to a 3-room flat in a non-mature estate, and can get some proceeds from that move, will still be eligible for an SHB. A lateral move but because they are moving from a mature estate to a non-mature estate, they can unlock some proceeds and they will still be eligible for SHB.Next, to receive the SHB, seniors must top up some proceeds from their move into their CPF Retirement Account. This is to ensure that they have adequate savings for retirement. The top-up required today depends on their net sales proceeds and we will simplify this such that seniors only need to top up the first $60,000 of their proceeds.Thirdly, we will increase the maximum cash bonus by 50%, from $20,000 to $30,000. So, seniors will receive $1 in cash bonus for every $2 topped up to their CPF Retirement Account. So, if you have sales proceeds, you top up $60,000, you will get $30,000 in Silver Housing Bonus.In line with this increase, we will also increase the maximum Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) bonus across all flat types. This means that owners of 3-room or smaller, 4-room, and 5-room or larger flats will get a larger bonus. The maximum cash bonus will be $30,000, $15,000 and $7,500 respectively.We are also looking at alternative housing options for seniors. Last year, we shared that MND is working with MOH to pilot assisted living, which allows seniors to buy a flat along with care services. Mr Arasu Duraisamy asked about the status of this project.Both Ministries have held several focus group discussions on the assisted living models. They were generally very well received by seniors, particularly singles and those whose children have moved out. Seniors were especially attracted to the idea of community living.We have incorporated the feedback into our pilot. For example, this new pilot that we will be rolling out will have large communal spaces on every floor, not just on the void deck, but on every floor, where residents can gather and interact. The flats will be sized at 32 sqm, with senior-friendly features like larger bathrooms and a layout that can be easily configured for mobility needs.We will launch the pilot with about 160 units in Bukit Batok in May this year. More details will be shared in the coming weeks, including the sales conditions, indicative flat prices and the payment options.We also want to make public housing more inclusive, especially for persons with disabilities and mobility issues, something which Miss Cheryl Chan highlighted. We have made progress in this area in creating barrier-free access for all our HDB estates, but certainly more can be done. As Miss Cheryl Chan said, technology may well open up new possibilities. We thank her for her ideas and the Government will continue to study this issue.One area when it comes to barrier-free access is having lift access on every floor. Several Members have asked about this – Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Ong Teng Koon, and Mr Png Eng Huat. As Members are aware, there are still about 150 blocks that are not eligible for the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP).To set things in context, we have managed to provide direct lift access for flats in the vast majority of HDB blocks. We have done so by using innovative technical solutions and by exercising flexibility for some blocks even when they exceed thecost cap of $30,000 per household. But for the remaining 150 blocks, for some of them, LUP is just not technically feasible, regardless of thecost. For many others, thecosts are very high. So, it is not just about having some flexibility above thecost cap but we are talking aboutcosts that can be more than $200,000 per household in some cases. As Mr Png Eng Huat said – enough to buy another HDB flat.So, we will continue to explore new technical methods to bring down the LUPcost, but it will not be so easy to make progress on this front. In the meantime, we know that some residents may urgently need direct lift access due to medical or mobility issues. And really, it is morecost-effective to help them move to another flat. Mr Png Eng Huat asked for SERS. I do not think we need to SERS the entire block. But what we will do is to offer a new Lift access Housing Grant of up to $30,000 to help those with medical or mobility issues buy a new or resale HDB flat with direct lift access. So, if anyone is in need and they need direct lift access, they do not want to wait, and the grant is available for them to move to a new place which will have direct lift access.A third priority for us is to continue to rejuvenate our HDB towns and keep them vibrant for generations to come, and we have many upgrading programmes. Let me start at the block-level.7.00 pmTown Councils are generally responsible for regular and cyclical maintenance of common property, including building façades, and the Government supports the Town Councils for such work, so that thecosts are not just borne by the Town Councils from their collections of service and conservancy charges (S&CCs).For example, MND has provided additional grants to help Town Councils with their operating needs and long-term capital expenditure requirements, including for lift maintenance and lift replacement.On the issue of façade repairs, which Mr Pritam Singh asked about, HDB will bear half of thecosts. But if the damages are clearly due to design or construction issues, HDB will cover 100% of thecosts. On the specific case that Mr Pritam Singh asked about, we will get back to him quite soon, based on the PE's assessment of what the damages were due to.Beyond the work of the Town Councils, there is Government upgrading through the Home Improvement Programme (HIP). We have finished selecting all flats built up to 1986 for Home Improvement. We are now ready to move on to the flats built between 1987 and 1997. There are 230,000 of such flats. This year, we will start with almost one quarter of that or 55,000 flats. We are starting with a bigger number to also help support the construction industry during this period. Town Councils have submitted their nominations for this next phase of HIP, and we will inform the Town Councils of the selected projects later this week and then work can get started as soon as we can. We are prioritising the selection by age, so that the older flats go first, and most flats should be able to get the upgrading when they are about 30 years old.It will take around 10 years to finish the HIP for this series of blocks built between 1987 and 1997. At around that time, our oldest HDB blocks will be about 60 years old and, if our Budget permits then, as we have said, we will initiate the second round of HIP, or HIPII, for these older flats. So, we will, almost every year be continuing with upgrading works.Besides block-level programmes, at the precinct-level, we will refresh older precincts with new amenities through the on-going Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) and we will be selecting 20 NRP projects for implementation this year. In the past, we used to do about 14. Again, we have raised it to 20 projects, partly to support the construction sector.If there are new in-fill developments within an old precinct, then HDB, as the developer, will also provide for facilities to link up the old and new precincts, which is something that Mr Png has asked for. He expressed some disappointment with HDB design. I should say that HDB blocks are designed by a range of architects, not all by HDB. Many are designed by private sector architects. There are some by HDB. The architects take great pride in their work. We will let them know how Mr Png feels about their void decks which are maze-like and confusing. But I am sure they will want to take in feedback and continue to work on these designs to do better.Finally, at the town-level, we will renew existing towns through the Remaking Our Heartland programme (ROH). We have selected nine towns and estates for ROH so far. This year, we will select another four towns for ROH. They are Bukit Merah, Queenstown, Choa Chu Kang and Ang Mo Kio. The remaking works that can be explored include refreshing of the town and neighbourhood centres, and enhancing of greenery and community spaces in parks or even areas under viaducts.And we will do all of this refreshing and rejuvenating while strengthening the distinctive heritage and identity of our individual housing estates, something which Mr Teo Ser Luck and many others have highlighted. We will want to preserve and even strengthen their distinctive heritage and identity, even as we put in new features and rejuvenate these towns. We will also engage and work with residents closely in this endeavour so that we can remake our heartlands together.HIP, NRP and ROH are our key upgrading programmes which we will continue to press forward with. At some point, as our flats and estates get older, we will need to more systematically redevelop and renew these older estates. That is why we have said that we will be introducing a new programme called the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS). We expect to roll out the first VERS project sometime after 2030. This is a major programme and we will need to work through the details. We will take some time to do so and we will share that with Singaporeans when we are ready.In the meantime, we will make our towns greener and more sustainable. Several Members have asked about our plans for this. Tengah, our newest and greenest HDB town, offers a glimpse of what we can do and aim to do. Tengah will be equipped with the latest sustainable features, including a centralised cooling system. It will have dedicated walking and cycling paths and lots of community green spaces.So, as we push the boundaries in our new towns, we will do likewise in our older towns. That is why we will be launching the new HDB Green Towns programme. It is a 10-year plan to make existing HDB towns more environmentally sustainable and more liveable.Let me highlight some of the key initiatives under this programme:First, we will work with Town Councils to introduce smart LED lighting in all our HDB estates. Using sensors, the system dims to provide just enough ambient lighting when common areas are unoccupied, then brightens again before residents enter an area. It is motion sensors but they are enhanced motion sensors, much better than what you have seen so far. It uses up to 60% less energy than normal LED lighting.We will also harness more renewable energy to power common services in HDB estates. We are already installing solar panels on the rooftops of close to 50% of HDB blocks. You do not seen that very often because very few people see HDB blocks from the sky. But half of our HDB blocks today will have HDB panels on their rooftops. We will increase this to 70% by 2030. We will also deploy more efficient solar panels and aim to more than double the total solar power capacity on HDB rooftops, from 220 megawatt-peak (MWp) today to 540 MWp by 2030. So, this will provide clean energy for our common services in our HDB estates and, in turn, benefit our residents.Second, we will recycle rain water and mitigate flood risks. To do that, we will pilot a new underground water detention system. Rainwater collected can be used for non-potable purposes, like washing of the void decks and watering of plants.Third, to help cool our HDB estates, we will deploy a new type of paint, called \"cool paint\", that can reduce the heat absorbed by buildings. Our preliminary studies suggest that such \"cool paint\" may be able to reduce ambient temperatures in HDB estates by up to two degrees. So, we will test this across several neighbourhoods to confirm its effectiveness before rolling it out across all estates.Finally, we will also work with Town Councils and the community to convert the top decks of suitable multi-storey carparks into urban farms, community gardens or rooftop greenery. This increases green cover and provides more green spaces for all the residents to enjoy.With the Green Towns programme, we aim to reduce energy consumption in HDB towns by 15% from today’s levels. This is a major effort and the Government, Town Councils and our residents will all need to do our part. Only then can we build greener and more sustainable HDB towns for our next generation.Our efforts to green Singapore do not stop with our HDB towns. We will also push ahead with our efforts to build our future city.One of Singapore’s defining features is our lush greenery and we will be doubling down on our greening strategy, as Second Minister Desmond Lee has elaborated just now.Our green strategy also covers our urban infrastructure and buildings. We have made good progress in greening our buildings and we will continue to accelerate this effort, as Minister of State Zaqy explained.Transport infrastructure is also key. We have set bold targets to move towards cleaner vehicles, including electric vehicles. On our part, MND will expand the necessary charging infrastructure. We will work with private companies to introduce more charging points at selected public carparks, taking into account the geographical spread of EV chargers, carpark usage, space availability for electrical upgrades and estate upgrading plans. Mr Ong asked for some details on this but we are still working through the detailed plans and we will share more in the coming months.There are many other exciting areas where technology can make a difference in our urban transformation and improve our quality of life. That is why we are committing close to $1 billion in Urban Solutions and Sustainability research to build a more liveable, sustainable and resilient city.We will also continue with our longer term plans to rebuild and remake our city for the future. Over the next 10 to 15 years, we will continue developing new growth centres outside the city centre to enhance Singapore’s economic infrastructure. We have plans in the East, in the West and in the North-East around Changi Airport; in the West around Jurong Innovation District and Jurong Lake District; and in the North with the Punggol Digital District as well as Sungei Kadut. In the longer term, beyond the next 10 to 15 years, we have major sites for redevelopment, as Members would be aware, including the Paya Lebar Airbase when the military airbase moves out and the Greater Southern Waterfront. These are ambitious, major long-term plans which will take several decades to realise. So, it is an opportunity for all of us to start imagining what a future Singapore can be and to work towards realising it.Of course, we all recognise that the best-laid plans of Man do not always come to pass. The future is not preordained. There will be unexpected challenges along the way. At the start of this year, no one could have predicted that we would be dealing with a virus outbreak today and that this virus outbreak would be potentially escalating into a global problem. It reminds me of what our founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, used to say. He said this twice, on two occasions during his birthday dinners. He said, and I quote: \"Only a people who are willing to face up to their problems and be prepared to work with their leaders to overcome unexpected hardships with courage and resolution deserve to thrive and prosper.\"And that is why the theme of the Budget this year is \"Unity\". With a united purpose, we can overcome our current challenges. We can continue to plan for tomorrow and we can continue to work together to build a better city and home.The Chairman: Clarifications. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah: Thank you, Sir. I am glad to hear from the Minister that, this round, there will be many more homes selected for HIP and, certainly, the older part of Nee Soon South built in 1987 should be among the first batch.I have five supplementary questions for Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad and one question for Minister Grace Fu.The first question: just now Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad mentioned that there should be no discrimination against foreign contractors. That one we fully understand. But I think the Minister of State has missed my point. I said local contractors felt that they were being discriminated against, not the foreign contractor. Why? Because they submitted the lowest tender, they did not get the job, they had been doing LTA projects. So, why do we pay $6 million to a foreign contractor which is registered in Virgin Islands and BCA, being the agency championing —The Chairman: Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, I think you should make your clarification rather than repeat your speech.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah: Okay. So, the first question is, can the Minister of State look into the discrimination of the local contractor. Second question, I mentioned about the contractor saying that the carpenters and tilers are no longer coming to Singapore. Can BCA look into this so that they can continue to have workers? And the third question is that, it is good that BCA has asked developers to help contractors, but then developers they have tight practical completion period and ABSD to comply with. Instead of just case-by-case basis that BCA will consider, is it possible to review these for this period so that they do not feel so much stress during this period.7.15 pmAnd the fourth question, ABSD, can it be pro-rated? Currently, even if one unit is not sold, you have to pay up to 25% of the landcost.And the last question, I would like to ask how many Polytechnic graduates currently join the construction sector. Because if I understood Minister of State correctly, he mentioned that they will be groomed to replace as S Pass holders. But as far as we understood, many of them, immediately upon graduation, they go overseas or head to a local University to get a degree instead of entering the workforce.My question to Minister Grace Fu is that, it seems that there is a very efficient, high rate of solving the problems reported to MSO. I would like to know how is this being monitored. The feedback that I got from residents is that MSO is very keen to close the case very fast. And I tried that myself. So, in January, I took one photograph. I sent to MSO. Straightaway, they replied me, \"Thank you for your report to MSO. We will revert to the relevant work unit\". They consider that closed. I asked them a question, \"Can you take a photograph when the work is done so that I know that it is closed.\" And then, no further reply. So, I think many of my residents have similar experience. That is why the feedback to me that MSO is very keen to close the case though the end result is not what we want.Mr Zaqy Mohamad: I am honoured to get five questions from Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.First, I just want to assure Er Dr Lee Bee Wah that the tender methods we use today follow the Price-Quality Method or PQM, so, it is not always guaranteed that the lowest price wins. It has to be on merit, based on the quality matrices. Unfortunately, specific to the tender, I cannot comment on LTA's evaluation because I do not have access to that particular tender. But rest assured, our approach has been about building our local firms' capabilities and giving them that chance. As I have said, you have seen more and more local firms accessing larger projects either on their own or through joint ventures. That is where you also pick up new capabilities, new skills and new technologies that you can use and apply to meet the kind of requirements that we have. For some of these projects, such as LTA tenders, I do understand. Some of these involving trains do have specific requirements. So, there could be certain technical requirements that were evaluated.But do not give up. Certainly, these are areas in which you have seen more and more local firms coming through; and certainly, we are giving more opportunities.If I could just share that between 2017 and 2019, local firms have been awarded a higher proportion of contracts, in terms of the smaller contracts between $3 million and $85 million. You can see about 90% of such contracted awarded to local firms. This enables local firms to build their track record.And you can also see that more are also being awarded larger public sector contracts over $85 million too. A decade ago, we used to have only a 40% proportion. Today, local firms have about 50% proportion. These are larger projects above $85 million. So, to some extent, we have seen progress. And I think it is good to see more local firms, as I have mentioned in my examples earlier, being able to take on these opportunities.On carpenters and tilers, we looked into this. It is not easy to get foreign workers sometimes, especially with some skill-sets because it is not just about our environment here but also the environment there. Contractors tell me too, that in the past they could get ready access to Chinese workers; but as China develops, they are paying their workers more over there, and there is less impetus for them to come here. When more and more countries develop, there will be opportunities out there. Our carpenters and tilers are typically from Malaysia, and you will probably find younger Malaysians being more educated too. So, supply may come down.To some extent, it is more than just our local environment that causes some of these dynamics.The Member asked earlier on about the Project Completion period. As I have mentioned, we will monitor this. So far, there are just a few appeals. Let us talk to the industry again and see how we can manage this better. And certainly for now, it is on case-by-case basis but we will continue to monitor the situation.On pro-rating the ABSD, or the extension of remission timelines today, I think we can still discuss and negotiate. We understand the current situation. To some extent, we do not have to shift the whole mechanism or the whole system. But I think right now, the approach that we are taking is really on a case-by-case basis. If developers have difficulty meeting their ABSD obligations, we will take it on a case-by-case basis. Let us monitor and see how best we can help developers and builders cope with the current COVID-19 situation.It is not in our interest to make life difficult for our developers and builders. It is a growing sector and we do have long-term pipelines of projects that are being rolled out, not just in the public sector but also in the private sector. We want our local companies to be able to address them. We will help them as much as we can.On Polytechnic graduates, I do not have the numbers. Perhaps the Member would like to file a Parliamentary Question because what she is asking for is specific in terms of pipeline and graduates. So, maybe file a Parliamentary Question in due course.Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Mr Chairman, I would like to address Er Dr Lee Bee Wah's question. I thank her for the question. MSO does monitor the time taken to close the case because it is our objective to ensure that we deliver good Public Service, good public municipal services in an effective and timely way. We look at the time taken and we pay particular attention to cases that take longer than usual.Having said that, we do not stipulate the service standards for each of the agencies because the nature of cases can be different. Some cases can be cleared quite easily. If there is litter that is not cleaned, someone can clean it up quite quickly. But if there is a request for public lighting to be installed, then obviously, the cases would take longer.We do recognise that even though service standards are not prescribed, public officers, knowing that MSO is watching, tend to want to do the right thing and try to close the cases as quickly as possible. In many of these cases, it is about giving a better reply. In cases where it is expected to take longer, such as doing maintenance in time, when we are doing a cyclical maintenance in three months' time or six months' time, we do want to go back and give the appropriate answer to the resident. If we give the appropriate reply, I think we can manage the expectations of the residents better.With that in mind, we have stipulated, what we call a post-case poll. If you have received a reply from agencies but you are not satisfied with the reply, or if you do not think that your case or feedback has been satisfactorily addressed, you can indicate it through the poll rating and you can also follow up with subsequent submission on the same issue.We are paying attention to how we are closing the cases and we want to see that not only do we do it efficiently, we are also doing it effectively and from the residents' point of view, we are addressing their concern appropriately."

        "Sitting Date": "6-3-2020",
        "Section Name": "Second Reading Bills",
        "MPs Speaking": "[The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad), Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon), Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied), Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon), Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap, Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol), Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar), Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio)]",
        "Content": "Order for Second Reading read.2.11 pmThe Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for National Development): Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Minister for National Development, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".Singapore has developed rapidly over the last 55 years. And we need to ensure that our building infrastructure remains well-maintained and safe. This is particularly important for older buildings. Today, about 70% of our building stock is more than 20 years old. In addition, our buildings, both old and new, will need to be made more accessible to meet the needs of an ageing population, as well as persons with disabilities (PWDs).It is in this context that we are proposing amendments to the Building Control Act, to strengthen the building control regulatory framework and to improve accessibility of our built environment.Currently, the Building Control Act sets out the duties of relevant parties, such as owners, developers, builders and professionals at the design and construction stages of a building. For example, at the design stage, the developer is required to submit building and structural plans to BCA for approval. At the construction stage, a Qualified Person is required to supervise the works to ensure that buildings are constructed according to the approved plans.But after a building is completed, there are also requirements to maintain the building so that it is safe to use. These requirements pertaining to maintenance are currently in the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA). It gives the Commissioner of Buildings the power to compel owners to carry out repairs to a building that is not properly maintained. It also gives the Minister the powers to enact regulations pertaining to the operation and maintenance of lifts and escalators (L&E).One of the key aims of this Bill is to consolidate the design, construction and maintenance requirements over a building's life-cycle under the Building Control Act, by porting over the relevant provisions from the BMSMA, at clauses 21, 45 and 48. The BMSMA will be renamed the Building (Strata Management) Act to better reflect its revised scope. This consolidation will facilitate BCA's oversight over the various building-related processes. It will also allow us to strengthen the building control regulatory framework to improve safety and accessibility in a holistic manner.Besides this consolidation, the Bill contains amendments to the Building Control Act which broadly covers the following three areas.First, it will strengthen regulatory control over the lift and escalator industry, allowing us to mandate a Progressive Wage Model for this sector. Second, it will provide for a building facade inspection regime. And last, but not least, it will accelerate accessibility upgrading in existing buildings.So, let me go through these areas in turn.First, on L&E. There are about 70,000 lifts and 7,000 escalators in Singapore today. We need to ensure that they are designed, installed and maintained properly, so that they are safe to use. This is important as we rely on them in our everyday lives, to get home, to get to work, or simply to get to town.Currently, the regulatory regime focuses on L&E maintenance and operation. So, for example, BCA mandates their maintenance frequency and outcomes, requires annual inspection and testing of the L&E, as well as for owners to apply for a permit to operate annually.Upstream, BCA requires professional engineers to certify that the design and installation of L&E are done according to industry codes and standards.We propose to strengthen BCA's upstream regulatory oversight for L&E, to reduce the likelihood of deficiencies in design or installation which may give rise to downstream safety incidents. Broadly, we will do this by extending the existing design and construction regime for buildings to L&E installations as well. This approach is consistent, given that L&E are integral parts of our buildings.First, clauses 2 and 3 will empower BCA to require L&E professionals to submit design plans for L&E works to BCA for approval just as they would for building works.L&E professionals will then need to ensure that the L&E are installed according to the approved plans. Penalties for L&E offences will be aligned with those for existing building offences of a similar nature.Second, the Minister will have powers to enact regulations to prescribe the key requirements of L&E design and installation, as well as the corresponding duties of stakeholders. For example, we intend to require L&E professionals to ensure that the lift model and its key safety components are certified by independent certification bodies, as part of the new plan submission process.At the same time, we will also enhance BCA's ability to improve safety for both new and existing L&E installations. We will do this in several ways.First, under clause 21, relevant parties, such as L&E owners and contractors, will be required to notify BCA of any safety-related defects they may become aware of. For instance, contractors may come across manufacturing defects during the maintenance of a particular lift. They will need to inform BCA so that BCA can get the L&E owners to rectify the defects in this lift and to check other similar lifts to make sure that such defects are not systemic.Clause 20 will allow the Commissioner of Building Control to issue orders to L&E owners to prevent safety incidents from occurring. For instance, when a check has revealed that there is an imminent safety risk arising from poor design or installation, the Commissioner of Building Control can issue an order to the owner to stop operating the lift or escalator until the risk has been mitigated or removed. This will supplement existing powers to require L&E owners to address maintenance-related issues.Third, clause 16 will allow the Minister to mandate the retrofitting of existing L&Es, for example, if certain models of L&E or their components are prone to incidents that affect public safety.The Bill also increases the range of levers available against errant L&E contractors. Currently, the Commissioner of Building Control can censure or suspend the contractor, revoke the contractor's registration, impose composition sums or prosecute them.This range of measures is not adequate. For instance, suspending or revoking the registration of a contractor may have unintended safety implications if L&E owners are not able to find an alternative contractor to maintain their L&E. On the other hand, simply censuring or imposing financial penalties may not be sufficient to resolve the underlying concerns for public safety. An errant contractor could continue to also take on more L&E jobs without carrying out internal improvements to meet the required standards.Thus, clause 36 introduces a registration scheme for L&E contractors and sets out additional regulatory sanctions.Under the new section 29R, BCA will also be able to disallow an errant L&E contractor from taking on new L&E jobs for a specified period, or cap the number of new L&E jobs that can be taken for a specified period, or mandate that employees are retrained to specified standards. Basically, it goes beyond just the machinery but also the standard of employees that may need to maintain our L&Es.Clause 36 also introduces a new section 29Q, which is needed for the L&E industry to be able to attract and retain competent technicians and engineers to ensure that our L&Es are safe.The L&E industry faces the challenges today of an ageing workforce and they also have difficulty in attracting new entrants, especially younger technicians. In January 2017, an L&E Sectoral Tripartite Committee (STC) was formed to look into the sector's manpower challenges. This committee, co-chaired by NTUC and BCA, comprised representatives from Government agencies, industry associations and unions, as well as service buyers and providers.One of its key recommendations was to introduce a progressive wage model (PWM) for the lift industry. The PWM seeks to increase basic wages across the board for local lift technicians, particularly at the lower levels. The recommended wages are pegged against comparable technician jobs in other sectors. The PWM also creates clear career progression paths and ensures that wages are commensurate with the job responsibilities and competencies.The Government accepted the STC's recommendation in September 2018 and announced that we would work towards mandating PWM adoption for lift maintenance firms. From May 2019, Government Procuring Entities have taken the lead by only awarding lift maintenance tenders to firms that have adopted the PWM. BCA has been working with industry stakeholders to implement the PWM and the associated training and certification framework.The results have been encouraging and lift firms representing 95% of the market share have committed to adopt the PWM. I thank the industry for their support for PWM and their efforts to uplift the pay and wages of our lift technicians. We encourage the remaining firms to adopt the PWM early as well.Under the new section 29Q, BCA is conferred powers to mandate PWM adoption as a registration requirement for L&E firms. We aim to mandate PWM for the lift industry by 2022.Going beyond the lift industry, MOM has recently announced the Tripartite Cluster for Lift and Escalator Industry, which will look into a PWM for escalator maintenance technicians. We expect the Tripartite Cluster to provide its recommendations by the end of the year.Besides reviewing the regulatory framework for lifts for people, we also reviewed the regulatory framework for Mechanised Car Parking Systems (MCPS). These are automated car lifting systems that transport a car, without its driver, to and from a parking area. BCA does not regulate the operation and maintenance of MCPS today. However, BCA has found that these systems could potentially pose a danger to users. For example, some MCPS do not have measures to prevent unauthorised access into the transfer areas, which pose a safety concern should users get trapped in the parking area.Thus, clause 45 amends section 49 to enable the Minister to enact regulations for MCPS to enhance user safety. Our current intent is to regulate only areas where users directly interface with the equipment, such as the car transfer area, and the operating panel for parking and retrieval.Let me move on to the second area of the Bill – how we will improve the safety of our building facades. Currently, owners and persons responsible have a duty to ensure that building exteriors are kept in good and serviceable repair and that exterior features are securely fixed. In this regard, general maintenance works are already carried out regularly on building facades. These works can include simple rectifications, general cleaning as well as painting of external walls.However, there is a need for us to further improve the facade maintenance standards. Over the last three years, BCA received reports of almost 30 incidents involving falling facade elements each year. Most of these were related to the wear and tear of the facade materials or connections. Thus, we will put in place a more structured approach towards the inspection and maintenance of building facades. This will help guide owners in meeting their existing duty regarding facade maintenance.Clauses 23, 24 and 25 amend the present Part V of the Building Control Act to introduce a new Periodic Facade Inspection regime that will require owners to engage professionals to check their building facades regularly. This will help to detect signs of facade deterioration early and facilitate timely repairs to reduce the likelihood of facade failure. The regime will apply to buildings that are more than 13 metres high – or roughly four storeys – once they are over 20 years old.Inspections must be conducted by trained personnel every seven years. This takes into consideration the expected lifespan of some facade materials. It is also aligned with the typical length of Repair and Redecoration cycles for HDB estates and condominium developments, to savecosts and reduce inconvenience to residents.BCA will introduce inspection guidelines and strengthen R&D efforts to look into more effective and productive ways to carry out facade inspections. In addition to the new facade inspection regime, the Bill will also introduce requirements for the relevant parties to report safety-related defects as well as incidents relating to facades. This is similar to our approach with the L&Es.Mr Speaker, I will touch upon the third key area of the Bill, which is to enhance the accessibility of our built environment. We first introduced accessibility requirements for new buildings in 1990, with a Code on Barrier-free Accessibility in Buildings. In consultation with representatives from social service agencies, trade associations and chambers as well as Government agencies, the Code has undergone several revisions over the years to ensure that the provisions address the evolving needs of Singaporeans, taking reference from international standards.Besides new buildings, the Code also applies to existing buildings that undergo addition and alteration (A&A) works. However, the current requirements only apply at the specific locations in the building where the A&A works are undertaken. For example, if A&A works are carried out to renovate the washrooms on the upper floor of a building, we can require that the washrooms of that floor be made accessible.However, we cannot require the building owner to provide an accessible route connecting the building entrance on the ground floor to the lifts if no A&A works are carried out there. Thus, for many buildings built before 1990, such basic accessibility upgrading is only carried out on a voluntary basis. We are amending this to make sure that we can provide a more holistic treatment.With your permission, Mr Speaker, may I ask the Clerks to distribute an information sheet showing pictures of these buildings?Mr Speaker: Yes. [Handouts were distributed to hon Members.]Mr Zaqy Mohamad: As can be seen from the sheet, Tong Building, IOB Building and Bukit Merah Community Centre are among some examples of buildings that provide basic accessibility features on their own accord. These features refer to an accessible building entrance, an accessible route at the entrance level and at least one toilet in the building with lift access if the accessible toilet is on another floor.We should do more to ensure that our existing buildings are made accessible to all, whenever A&A works are undertaken. Today, almost all of our public sector buildings and infrastructure that are frequented by the general public have achieved at least basic accessibility.To accelerate accessibility upgrading in our existing buildings, especially the private ones, clause 17 introduces a new section 22DA that empowers the Commissioner of Building Control to require the owner of a building without basic accessibility features to provide these features when the owner or someone else undertaking A&A works to that building that requires plan submissions to BCA is given approval for those A&A works, regardless of where those A&A works are carried out in the building.The new section 22DA will apply only to commercial and institutional buildings with a gross floor area (GFA) of more than 500 sqm. Examples include offices, hotels, schools and shopping centres. We will exclude smaller buildings, such as shop houses, from these requirements because there is space constraints.The Bill will also make other changes to improve and clarify the Builder licensing scheme and to facilitate BCA's operations. Licensed builders need to have an \"approved person\" who is responsible for the management of the business. To ensure proper accountability, clauses 31 and 32 amend sections 29F and 29G to stipulate that only a Director or a Board member can be an \"approved person\". These amendments will also allow more types of businesses to apply for a Builder's licence, including sole proprietors and partnerships comprising corporations.This will provide greater flexibility for the industry. For example, smaller firms will be able to form partnerships to take on projects beyond their individual capacity. I hope Er Dr Lee Bee Wah is happy that more local firms can participate in bigger projects, too.Clause 34 amends section 29J to widen the range of regulatory sanctions that the Commissioner of Building Control can impose on builders. This includes restricting the builder from taking on any new project or any new project above a certain value. The rationale for this change is similar to what I had earlier described – to enhance the measures to regulate L&E contractors.A few clauses will improve the clarity of the legislation to facilitate the administration of the Act. Clause 8 amends section 11 to make it it clear that builders need to notify the Commissioner of Building Control of the appointment or termination of a specialist builder within 14 days and that builders are accountable for the works that they subcontract out.Clause 27 amends section 29A to make clear that builders need not be licensed if they are always carrying on their business as sub-contractors. Clause 20 will require owners in non-strata titled buildings to jointly appoint a Qualified Person (QP) for the purpose of complying with BCA's orders, if such orders are served on multiple owners. This will avoid a situation where each owner engages its own QP, which may result in different recommendations and delays in complying with BCA's orders.BCA has consulted industry stakeholders, including building owners, contractors and professionals, on the key changes through more than 10 engagement sessions over the last four years. The industry stakeholders were supportive of the changes. BCA will continue to work closely with the industry to implement the changes proposed in this Bill, which will enhance safety and accessibility in our built environment. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.Question proposed.2.30 pmEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. The amendments are certainly welcome, especially in light of episodes of lifts breaking down in 2018.I support the amendments for proper registration and training of lift technicians. We know individual lift companies may have their own in-house training, but how adequate are these training sessions? There is also a lack of career path for the technicians. Hence, you do not attract jobseekers and there would be job-hopping, maybe leading to staff who are not adequately trained.Next, how do we regulate that the technical crew are not pressured to do jobs in a hurried manner or jobs they are not trained to do, because they have to meet a quota of servicing X number of lifts in a day?Based on my observation in Nee Soon South, definitely, there is a lot of room for improvement in the quality of lift maintenance and quality of service by lift companies. Sometimes, they even shut down the lift without putting up proper signage and proper notice to the residents. Sometimes, soon after the lift is back to order, back to working condition, then it breaks down again. It just shows that the checking was not thorough enough and that caused a lot of inconvenience to the residents. Also, I believe there is a great shortage of technicians and engineers. That is why they hurriedly finish the work and then put it back into service again.Can the Minister share with this House how many lift technicians do we have in the industry currently? The Minister of State mentioned that there are 70,000 lifts in Singapore. But how many technicians are there? What is the target number and the schedule of rolling out? What is the duration of the course? How many qualified trainers do we have to conduct courses on lift maintenance? Are we also training more lift engineers, too?Secondly, are we expecting an increasing number of carparks using mechanised parking system? These are very specialised systems and they need to be properly installed and maintained. Otherwise, any freak accidents can be catastrophic.Again, how many competent people are there to conduct the training? And how long does it take to get someone trained?Would Minister look into how the frequency of maintenance for lifts and mechanised carparks is determined? I think one important consideration is the frequency of the usage, rather than just a standard timeframe maintenance schedule.Next is the maintenance of building façades. Many building owners may want fanciful facades to make their structures stand out. But this is where aesthetics may be achieved at the expense of practicality of maintenance. We have our share of awnings and claddings on façades falling off. What is the protocol for the maintenance of these structures? How are the workers trained for such roles?Mr Speaker, these are burning issues which we must address in the public interest as we are quite a densely built up city state. In Chinese, please.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]In 2018, there were several lift breakdown incidents. Therefore, I support the Government to strengthen the regulation of this industry. From what I have observed, lift maintenance is hard work and there are few career progress opportunities. This could have resulted in the situation whereby people are not interested in positions in this industry. This is going to affect the quality of maintenance, and subsequently public safety.Furthermore, we do not know what the quality of training is like in the various companies. Hence, to establish a training and registration system for the technicians can ensure public safety better.Every now and then, we have episodes of claddings and awnings on facades falling off. May I know, for the workers installing and inspecting these facades, what kind of training they have undergone?2.35 pmMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied): Mr Speaker, I appreciate the rationale of this Bill to enhance public safety and accessibility of buildings. As an urban and densely built-up society, public safety of building structures and fixed installations are critical. That said, these measures will entailcosts, which will be a concern to those responsible, including Town Councils. Member Mr Fasal Manap, who chairs the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council, will elaborate further in his speech.I wish to seek clarifications on two particular aspects of the Bill.The first clarification is on the maintenance of exterior features of buildings. This Bill simplifies the definition of “exterior feature” to mean any permanent feature of a building that is installed on, forms part of or projects outwards from the roof or exterior of the building, and such other features that may be prescribed in the regulations. This is an improvement from the existing definition which contains a laundry list of features.I note that the Bill changes the definition of the person responsible to maintain these features. Under the existing Act, it is stated that for HDB blocks, the person responsible to maintain exterior features is either the HDB or the Town Council, depending on who the Minister designates for that feature. By this Bill, clause 2(q) will amend the law to remove HDB as a person responsible for the exterior feature, and place the responsibility on the Town Council or a contractor engaged by the Town Council who has charge and control of the management and maintenance of common property.I have two questions relating to this.First, what is the rationale of removing HDB from the definition as a person responsible for the exterior feature? Does this amendment change the responsibility of HDB towards problematic features? An exterior feature could have been unsafe from the point of construction; alternatively, it could become unsafe over time due to wear and tear or lack of maintenance, in which case, Town Councils will have to bear some responsibility. During the MNDCOS, I note that Minister had clarified that if an HDB block had a falling façade that could be attributed to a construction fault, HDB should pay thecost of rectification. This is eminently reasonable. In fact, the proposed section 25H makes clear that if a person responsible for an exterior feature can show that the defect was caused by materials or work supplied, the person responsible has a defence to a charge of failing to maintain the feature. What is the implication of removing HDB from the definition of “person responsible” for maintaining an exterior feature?The second question relates to the inclusion of the Town Council’s contractor as a “person responsible”, if that contractor has charge and control of the management and maintenance of the common property. Does this phrase mean a Town Council’s Managing Agent, where a Town Council has outsourced its operations to an MA? The same section makes it clear that for private property, such as condominiums, managing agents are persons responsible together with the owners. Could Ministry explain why, for HDB estates, the phrase “managing agent” is not used?Sir, clarity on who is responsible is necessary, as persons responsible have onerous duties under the Bill. These duties include the need to comply with BCA’s Notices to Maintain under the new section 25E, at theircost. They also have duties to report safety incidents under the new section 25B, and failure to perform these duties carries heavy responsibilities.Sir, my next clarification relates to clause 20 on building inspections and remedial works. Clause 20 provides for situations where the Commissioner of Building Control requires an owner to inspect and take remedial actions in respect of a potentially dangerous building, exterior feature or fixed installation, or a building product that carries a safety risk. The Bill will remove the need for such inspections and works to be overseen by qualified persons and simply require them to be done by appropriate persons. This will expand the class of persons who do such work beyond architects and professional engineers. What is the thinking behind apparently relaxing this requirement as we are dealing here with potentially dangerous structures and safety concerns? Will the Ministry provide guidance as to the alternative qualifications that such an appropriate person should have?2.40 pmMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): Sir, I stand in support of the Bill. Professionals from the lift industry have shared with me that lift maintenance is known as a \"3D\" industry – it is dark, dirty and dangerous. I would like to express my appreciation for the lift technicians who work tirelessly in dark, warm lift shafts to ensure that we can enjoy smooth and safe lift rides in our vertical city.I have three clarifications on the Bill relating to: (a) facilities for persons with disabilities (PWDs); (b) the progressive wage model (PWM) framework; and (c) working conditions for lift technicians.The new section 22DA allows the Commissioner of Building Control to require building owners to erect features to facilitate the access to and use of a building by PWDs. I have two concerns here.First, buildings that are used solely for residential purposes or as a factory are excluded from this section 22DA. Can the Minister share the rationale for excluding residential and factory buildings which are premises that PWDs will need to access? If residential and factory buildings are excluded from section 22DA, can the Minister share how it intends to ensure that building owners of residential and factory buildings will install features for access by PWDs?Second, the Commissioner can only require building owners to include features for PWDs if it receives an application from the building owner for approval of plans for the alternation, addition or repair of a relevant building. This will mean that the progress of ensuring that our buildings are PWD-friendly is dependent on the building owners deciding to undertake building works. Can the Minister share whether it has a target for ensuring that most, if not all, buildings in Singapore are PWD-friendly? What plans does the Ministry have to encourage building owners to include PWD-friendly facilities?Next, the amendments will legislate the PWM for the lift industry. I applaud the efforts to raise the wages of lift maintenance personnel who have to do a very difficult but an essential one. However, the PWM will only apply to Singaporeans and PRs. The reality is that lift companies have a large number of foreigners because of a severe shortage of lift technicians, given the difficult working conditions.Lift technicians who are foreigners are doing jobs that are equally as difficult and equally as dangerous as the jobs Singaporeans and PRs are doing. This is not just an issue of fairness, but one of safety and incentives. Do we want lift technicians who have to ensure the safety of lifts that we all take multiple times a day to feel disgruntled and that their colleague doing the exact same job is paid much higher than he or she is?In October 2018, during the debate on the Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill, I spoke about the need to ensure that the PWM will apply to cleaners who are hired directly by an F&B establishment and for foreign cleaners. I highlighted that PWM is about increasing productivity and standards and if we leave out our foreign cleaners from the PWM, bear in mind again that foreign cleaners likely form a bulk of the cleaning sector. This similarly applies to the lift technicians industry.MEWR has encouraged employers to incorporate the principles of progressive wages into the wage structure of their foreign cleaners. Will MND take similar steps to encourage the incorporation of PWM principles into the contracts for foreign lift technicians? Or will the Ministry also consider eventually extending the PWM to cover foreign lift technicians?Just in January this year, Minister Chan Chun Sing said “The real competition is Team Singapore, comprising Singaporeans, PRs and foreign workers here, competing with the rest of the world to give our fellow Singaporeans the best chance possible to win, not just in Singapore but across the entire globe.\"How can we say that we are Team Singapore if we discriminate against certain team members? How will a team work together well if we do not reward the same effort and merit with the same pay?Lastly, the Lift and Escalator Sectoral Tripartite Committee has recommended reviewing the Singapore Standard SS 550, the Code of Practice for lifts, to specify higher lighting levels within the lift shaft to facilitate maintenance work. The Ministry has accepted the recommendations in late 2018. I understand that BCA is also studying the feasibility of improving ventilation within the lift shaft and motor room to create a cooler work environment for the maintenance personnel. Can the Minister share its progress in implementing these recommendations to improve working conditions for lift technicians? Can the Minister also share details on how it intends to implement these other recommendations? Sir, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.2.45 pmMr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied): Sir, my speech will touch on the matters presented in this Bill, which has effect on Town Council estates' maintenance, in particular, the issue ofcost.Sir, two of the main objectives of this Amendment Bill are: (a) enhance safety of lifts, escalator and mechanised carpark system and (b) introduce a mandatory facade inspection regime for buildings more than 20 years old. I welcome these amendments as safety is paramount and should not be taken lightly.In recent years, we have heard and seen news on a number of cases that pertains to dislodgement of fixtures from HDB blocks' facade or exterior wall such as sunshades, decoratives and even bricks.Fortunately, no injury or fatality was reported. However, this is not the case for lift malfunction-related incidents that occurred in HDB blocks. In the last few years, there has been reports of residents or members of the public who are visiting, sustaining mild to serious injuries. I do hope with the tightening of legislation and measures as proposed in this Amendment Bill, it will provide a safer and more conducive living environment.Sir, I support this Amendment Bill. Nonetheless, as the Chair of Aljunied-Hougang Town Council, I do have concerns on thecost issue. Consequently, the adoption and the implementation of the new measures and regimes indicated in this Bill will be the additional expenditure. For example, as mentioned in this Bill, there will be a requirement to conduct the facade inspection regime for buildings which are older than 20 years and, thereafter, conducting a seven years' cyclical inspection.A town like Aljunied-Hougang is home to many HDB blocks which are 20 years and above, approximately more than 80%. We have encountered dislodgement of facade, fixtures, and one of these incidents was cited by my colleague Mr Pritam Singh two days ago during MND's Committee of Supply's debate.In view of this inevitable additional expenses, I would like to seek clarification from the Ministry whether the Town Councils will have to solely bear the additional expenses or will HDB, as the landlord, co-share the payment, which is similar to their current practice for facade repair expenses? Additionally, will the Ministry consider additional funding for Town Councils?Another point I want to raise is on availability of trained personnel or an appropriate person as mentioned in clause 20 on building inspections and other building works. This issue was touched on earlier by my colleague Ms Sylvia Lim. I would just like to seek the Ministtry's views on whether there will be any possibility of shortage of this appropriate person due to the enhanced measurements and regime introduced in this Bill, as there will be a higher demand for such individuals?In short, will there be an issue of imbalanced supply and demand situation, in particular, for the mandatory regime of facade inspection? If this shortage is likely to happen, what will be the Ministry's plan to address this issue?Sir, I look forward to the Ministry's clarification on these two matters that I have raised.2.48 pmMr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol): Mr Speaker, I would like to declare my interest in the Building Control (Amendment) Bill. I am currently the Chairman of the Tripartite Cluster for Lift & Escalator Industry but I would like to state that the expressed views in my speech are my own and not a representation of the committee’s view.As shared by the Minister of State, Mr Zaqy Mohamad, based on a study conducted by BCA, there are around 2,400 technicians of which 42%, or slightly over 1,000 are residents. This workforce maintains more than 70,000 lifts and 7,000 escalators every day. Maintenance personnel make up most of the sector’s workforce and are essential in providing day-to-day servicing to ensure lifts are well-maintained for safe and reliable use.In 2017, the Lift and Escalator Sectoral Tripartite Committee chaired by my fellow Labour Member of Parliament, Mr Melvin Yong, was formed comprising representatives from the Government, trade unions, industry associations and firms, and service buyers.A set of recommendations was made by the Committee and accepted by the Government on 19 September 2018 to provide better jobs to attract Singapore residents to join the industry, upskill the workforce to deliver better quality maintenance services, ensure commensurate wages to build up a core workforce to anchor the industry and push for the wider adoption of technology to reduce manpower reliance.The Committee has now been tasked to review the escalator industry and renamed the Tripartite Cluster for Lift and Escalator, which I am chairing, together with a co-chair from Singapore National Employers’ Federation, Mr Tony Khoo, CEO of EM Services.One of the recommendations put up by the first Tripartite Committee was the Progressive Wage Model to uplift the wages of the workers in the lift industry that commensurate with their skills, productivity and career progression. We need to attract young Singaporean to make them feel excited about the industry and their potential long-term career progression.Hence, I welcome the new section 29Q that gives the authority to the Commissioner of Building Control to specify the minimum amount of basic wage and bonus payable to the workers in the lift industry after considering the recommendations of the Tripartite Committee.The Tripartite Committee recommended that by 1 July 2022, all lift and escalator companies will pay the local technicians the salaries recommended by the Tripartite Committee.Based on my experience implementing PWM in the other sectors, engagement with Service Providers and Service Buyers are critical before the start of the full implementation to ensure the stakeholders will factor in possiblecost implications in the contract pricing. I would like to know whether BCA has any plans to engage the industry stakeholders on the implementation of the PWM to nudge them to anticipate and make the necessary preparation.Currently, there are approximately 95 lift firms. Of these 95, the top 12 firms or close to 13% of them command 86% of the market share. Similarly, for the escalator industry, there are 31 firms, with the top 11 firms maintaining 95% of the escalators in Singapore. This industry seems to have an oligopoly market structure with a few firms dominating the market.This state of oligopoly arises because the major players can exert proprietary rights over their spare parts and are not required to disclose the technical specifications of the lift systems. Hence, many of the lift technicians can only service lifts made by their companies. Such practices hinder market competition to the disadvantage of lift owners and discourage job mobility amongst the lift technicians as they do not have the knowledge and skills to service different types of lifts.Building owners often are compelled to award their maintenance contracts to the OEM lift firms for fear that other non-OEM companies would not be able to secure spare parts or have the experienced technicians to do troubleshooting and repair.In the European Union countries, the lift industry is encouraged to adopt an open and non-proprietary lift system which will serve to level the playing field and promote greater market competition. This would also allow the lift and escalator technicians to be cross-trained in different types of lifts and escalators. Moving forward, I would like to know whether BCA will consider open and non-proprietary system in our lift and escalator industry and make the necessary legislative amendments to make this possible.The Lift and Escalator industry, as shared by my fellow Member of Parliament is often perceived as having the 4 Ds – Difficult, Dirty, Dark and Dangerous. Hence, the Lift and Escalator Sectoral Tripartite Committee also formed a working committee and one of the committee’s terms of reference was to propose and develop solutions to improve key aspects of working conditions to enhance attractiveness of the job to new entrants.The working committee made several recommendations to improve the thermal comfort, illuminance level, and safety and ease of maintenance at working places on the lift.Based on the new amendment to this Bill under clause 20, section 24, will it give the authority to Commissioner of Building Control to compel lift owners to retrofit their existing lifts? As thecost of retrofitting new lifts to improve the work environment for the lift technicians can be very expensive, will there be funding support for such work to be carried out? Thecost of retrofitting on existing buildings can be substantial, especially for Town Council managing HDB estates. Hence, it would certainly help if all new HDB estates could take this into consideration at the planning and design stage, and the Government to provide funding support for existing lifts.Given the current profile of the current lift and escalator technicians, half of the resident workforce is likely to retire in the next 10 years. With the number of lifts and escalators increasing steadily, besides building up a pool of well-trained and skilled workers, we must rely on technology to improve our lift maintenance work processes and increase productivity.For example, the Building and Construction Authority currently mandates that a lift owner shall subject the lift to monthly maintenance by an approved lift contractor to ensure safe operation of the lifts. With different usage pattern and number of lift landings in a single lift shaft, it may be more efficient to use intensity of usage, that is, mileage travelled as a gauge instead. This is similar to how cars should be sent for servicing after certain distance travelled. Such mileage can be easily tracked using existing technology.In addition, the use of technology can go a long way in enhancing the safety and welfare of our lift and escalator technicians. Productive and innovative technology can reduce the maintenance work needed. For example, remote monitoring can collect data from lifts and notify technicians of faults or irregularities while remote diagnostics can improve the trouble-shooting process and pre-empt breakdowns before they happen.Hence, under this Act, would the Commissioner of Building Control be given the mandate to exercise flexibility to vary the standard operating procedures for lift maintenance given the advancement in technology? Mr Speaker, in Malay, please.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]I welcome the amendments in the Building Control Bill that gives the authority to the Commissioner of Building Control to specify the minimum amount of basic wage and bonus payable to the workers in the lift and escalator industry after considering the recommendations by the Progressive Wage Model recommendations by the Tripartite committee for this industry.This will mandate lift and escalator companies to pay the local technicians the salaries that was agreed with the tripartite committee. This is an important step to attract workers, especially the younger ones, to this essential industry. The Progressive Wage Model will ensure that their salaries commensurate with the competencies, responsibilities and productivity of the lift and escalator workers.(In English): In conclusion, while there is much to be done, I am heartened that the Government recognises the importance of the work of our lift and escalator technicians. Every worker matters and every job counts. I look forward to working with the industry stakeholders to create a better and safe environment not only for our workers but the public as users as well. I support the amendments to the Bill.2.58 pmMs Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar): Sir, this is a timely Bill and I fully support the amendments which cover quite a range of important areas, from enhancing lift and escalator (L&E) safety to ensuring more frequent façade inspections, from mandating a Progressive Wage Model for the L&E sector to regulating mechanised car parking systems.I would like to focus on the amendments for L&E today. I welcome the introduction of the requirement for elevator maintenance workers to possess minimum qualifications or certification before they can be allowed to perform works without supervision. Besides ensuring that they have acquired competency so that the overall maintenance standards are raised, this new rule will help to enhance safety for the workers as well.However, accidents can still occur. Could the Ministry share statistics on incidents resulting in injury?I hope the Ministry could consider providing incentives to encourage L&E maintenance companies to tap upon technology to boost work safety for their staff at the elevator and escalator sites.May I also take this opportunity to appeal for legislation to mandate higher insurance coverage for these workers?In the area of lift breakdowns, what are the numbers in the following categories: public housing, non-public housing, commercial, industrial and institutional? How can we further improve the reliability of L&E?I would like to ask the Minister if it is possible that we make greater use of technology to monitor the performances of our lifts and escalators, and minimise the need for human monitoring? This could help to reduce downtime and minimise inconvenience. Productivity could be increased too. Sir, in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]In the area of lift breakdowns, what are the numbers in the following categories: public housing, non-public housing, commercial, industrial and institutional? How can we further improve the reliability of lifts and escalators (L&E)?Finally, I would like to ask the Minister if it is possible that we make greater use of technology to monitor the performances of our lifts and escalators, and minimise the need for human monitoring? This could help to reduce the downtime and minimise inconvenience. Productivity could be increased too.3.01 pmMr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to share my views on the amendments affecting lifts in this Bill.As a densely built-up city state with more and more buildings rising above 20 storeys, it is very important that all the lifts installed are of good quality and are well maintained to ensure safety and reliability for all passengers. With a rapidly ageing society, lifts serve an increasingly essential role too, even in shorter buildings and facilities.In recent years, we have had a number of malfunctioning lift incidents, which had caused inconvenience and injuries. It is timely that we overhaul the relevant legislation and review the entire eco-system.HDB is the largest builder and enjoys the benefit of economies of scale. I would like to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that HDB is fully leveraging upon this to secure the best deal. Presently, different projects are handled by different contractors, so I am concerned that this advantage may not have been fully exploited.Next, how could we ensure the adequacy of lift parts to meet the mandatory lift maintenance regime as prescribed here since the replacement of existing lifts can only be done after 28 years? Should there be a need to have a central national storage for all the parts from the different lift manufacturers that have tendered successfully to install lifts for our flats and which have also undertaken to provide the parts for long-term maintenance?[Deputy Speaker (Mr Lim Biow Chuan) in the Chair]The use of technology can assist to provide checks on the maintenance of lifts. How would the Ministry encourage the use of technology to monitor the performance of lifts round-the-clock independently, particularly to ensure lift safety? Has the current approach been adequate in preventing lift breakdowns? Do we have a national benchmark for lift performance similar to what LTA has done for MRT trains?I fully support the amendment to empower the Minister to order existing lifts to be retrofitted with safety-related features. Many older lifts were installed without these features, which are specified in the latest standards. Such lifts could either be upgraded or replaced.Last but not least, the most crucial element here is manpower, and I strongly support the various proposals to boost our pool of lift specialists and deepen their expertise.It is important that we have a strong Singaporean core of locally trained lift specialists, with attractive incentives for them to remain in this sector and to make career progress. Introducing the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) to attract more Singaporeans to join this sector is a good start. Workers will be able to look forward to a clear progression pathway which correlates the new certification requirements with wage increments for each role.We need to increase the pool of Qualified Persons (QP) to meet inspection and maintenance enforcement requirements. I also fully support the proposal to introduce a new branch of specialist professional engineers in lift and escalator engineering.With that, I would like to conclude with my support for the Bill.Mr Deputy Speaker: Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad.3.05 pmMr Zaqy Mohamad: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank Members for their comments and their support of the Bill. Let me address the issues raised.Mr Louis Ng asked why residential buildings and factories were not included under clause 17, which requires for existing buildings without basic accessibility features to provide these when undergoing addition and alteration works.As I mentioned earlier, all buildings built since 1990 have to comply with the Code on Accessibility, including the provision of basic accessibility features. So, buildings in the last 30 years are now compliant. The changes under clause 17 target older buildings built before 1990, which do not have basic accessibility features.We are applying this requirement to commercial and institutional building types as these are more frequently accessed by members of the public. This is a calibrated approach as we are mindful of the physical challenges in existing buildings as well as thecost impact to building owners. Owners of residential and factory buildings can tap on the Accessibility Fund to co-fund up to 80% of thecost for installing basic accessibility features. The fund is available, and I urge them to do so.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked about maintenance of facades. As mentioned earlier, we will put in place a new Periodic Facade Inspection (PFI) regime. The regime provides a more structured approach towards the inspection and maintenance of facades so that owners can better meet their existing duty and enhance public safety.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap also asked about the regulation and training of personnel involved in facade inspections. Owners will need to appoint a competent person (CP) to carry out facade inspections. The CP must be either a professional engineer (PE) or registered architect, and can be assisted by facade inspectors (FIs) in carrying out inspections. So, they do not have to do it all on their own, but there are roles such as FIs that they can use. The FI must be a resident engineer, a resident technical officer, or any other person who possesses the relevant qualifications and experience.CPs and FIs must undergo a compulsory facade inspection course. Since 2017, more than 200 individuals have successfully completed the course. BCA will also introduce inspection guidelines in due course to guide CPs and FIs in performing their duties.These efforts will ensure that we will have a pool of qualified and competent personnel to support the new inspection regime.For these courses, they can also tap on SkillsFuture subsidies available. For those below 40 years old, they can get up to 50% subsidies. For older workers above 40, Singaporeans and Permanent Residents, they can get up to 90% subsidies too. To some extent, I think, if you look at the entire picture, we are trying to beef up our core capabilities.Ms Sylvia Lim also asked about the terms used in defining the persons responsible for maintaining building facades and about the responsibility for facade maintenance in HDB blocks.Let me clarify that the Bill does not change this responsibility. The definition being amended relates to exterior features. The maintenance of exterior features is part of any common property in HDB blocks that is currently covered under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act, or BMSMA in short.Today, the person responsible for such maintenance is defined in the BMSMA as the Town Council (TC) and not HDB. So, we are porting this across. In addition, the BMSMA's definition of \"person responsible\" includes the Town Council's contractor and the condominium's managing agents (MAs) as long as they have charge and control over common property.What we have done – it looks a bit complicated – but we are basically porting over the clauses in the existing BMSMA into the current Building Control Act. In the BMSMA, it was the Town Council mentioned – no HDB. But in the current Act, you do have HDB and Town Council. That is for retrofitting orders by the Minister. That will still be retained under clause 13, in which the Minister can still designate retrofitting works to HDB and Town Councils. So, there are no changes.Just to clarify again, maintenance of exterior features and facades is under the Town Council and its contractors, for coverage of retrofitting, it is HDB and Town Councils. So, there is no change effectively on the total outcome.Also, to clarify on the co-payment by HDB should you have facade repair issues, that comes under an existing HDB co-payment scheme. I think the Member also knows that if it is found to be a facade repair issue, HDB co-funds 50%. If found to be a design fault or construction issue, it will be 100% covered by HDB. So, the scheme is in place and not so much part of the Act.So, we have not changed the position when transferring the BMSMA provisions on maintenance of exterior features over to the Building Control Act.Ms Sylvia Lim also asked why clause 20 of the Bill amends the Act to no longer mandate that inspections ordered under section 24(1) be performed by an architect or professional engineer. She asked if this would have an impact on public safety.We expect most of the inspections to still be done by architects and professional engineers. However, depending on the specific situation, specialists with the necessary skills and competencies, such as in building materials and components, may be better equipped to carry out such inspections. So, it depends on the type of issue involved.The amendment allows for such specialists who may not be architects and PEs to be appointed to do inspections. Overall, there should be no impact on public safety. In fact, it should be better because now, you are allowing others with specialised engineering skills.Ms Lim and Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap noted that the PFI regime entailscost. The schedule for the PFI has been set at seven years, to be tied in with the repairs and redecoration (R&R) schedule that TCs, MAs and Management Corporation Strata Titles (MCSTs) conduct, to savecosts. Therefore, you can also leverage on the gondolas that you set up, other things that you typically do in terms of painting of the building, for example, and you can leverage on some of these things to reducecost.BCA will also work with owners responsible for many buildings to spread out the inspections in the initial phase to minimise any spikes incosts. BCA is working on other measures to help managecosts. These include building up the pool of CPs and FIs, and exploring, as some Members have also suggested, how technology can help to carry out inspections in a more effective and productive manner.In terms of whether there will be co-sharing ofcosts or additional funding provided to Town Councils for the new facade inspections, as building facades are part of common property and under the purview of TCs, TCs are responsible for conducting regular inspections to ensure that the facades are in good condition. As I mentioned, the schedule of the PFI has been set at seven years, which can be tied in with the R&R schedule to savecosts. BCA will also work with owners, including TCs to spread out inspections in the initial phase to minimise any spikes incosts.BCA is also working on other measures. For example, BCA launched a grant call with HDB for the development of a drone inspection system to carry out automated facade inspections. This reduces manpowercost in terms of getting gondolas up and all the other necessary infrastructure.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about the number of lifts in Singapore and their reliability. There are 70,000 lifts in Singapore and the number of safety incidents arising from technical faults has been less than 30 per year over the last three years. We will continue to monitor this carefully as we take the safety of all our users very seriously.At the same time, the number of lifts in Singapore is expected to grow. We recognise Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap's concern that there should be enough skilled manpower to keep our lifts safe and in working condition. That is why we have been working with the industry to build up capabilities and capacities at all levels.The Professional Engineers Board (PEB) introduced the specialist professional engineer (SPE) in lift and escalator engineering in 2017. Today, there are about 90 SPEs whose primary duties include supervising the installation of lifts and carrying out routine inspections. Their scope of work will increase with the new requirements under the Bill to also include the certification of new installations.To ensure that there continues to be enough competent personnel to inspect our lifts, BCA is working together with the Association of Consulting Engineers Singapore (ACES) and The Institution of Engineers, Singapore (IES) to train lift and escalator inspectors (LEIs).Graduates and diploma holders in the mechanical or electrical engineering disciplines who have relevant experience will be able to apply for registration as LEIs. They will need to complete an LEI training course and pass an examination. These efforts will grow the pool of L&E professionals to meet increasing demand.As for lift maintenance technicians, BCA and ITE have introduced courses for the various competency levels in the PWM to provide them with common engineering knowledge and skills on servicing lifts and their key components. Technicians will therefore be required to obtain the specialist level competency – so they must obtain this – before they are allowed to service lifts independently, once this regulation comes into effect. To date, almost 400 of the 2,100 lift technicians in Singapore have received the certificate of competency (CoC).I urge employers to start training up all the technicians. We are now giving a grace period before we put in the regulations. But this is the time as we have put in more support now with SkillsFuture and we need to help train and beef up our capabilities.I thank Mr Zainal Sapari and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for their support of the PWM for the lift industry. The PWM provides a common competency and wage framework for all lift firms. This will benefit more than 1,000 local lift technicians and ensure that their remuneration is commensurate with their job responsibilities and competencies. For example, a lift technician with the specialist level of competency will be able to earn a basic wage of at least $2,250, while a master specialist could earn $4,000 or more a month. BCA and ITE are also working with the industry to develop more courses to help lift technicians advance along their PWM career progression pathways. This will ensure consistency in training standards and facilitate job mobility, both of which were highlighted by Mr Zainal Sapari and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.As mentioned by Mr Zainal, we have, indeed, been engaging our stakeholders actively to encourage the early adoption of PWM. On the supply side, 40 lift firms, representing 95% of the market, have already committed to adopt the PWM. On the demand side, all Government procuring entities now award tenders only to lift firms that have adopted the PWM. BCA has been in discussions with Town Councils, trade associations and chambers (TACs) and other major service buyers, who have also been supporting the PWM. We encourage service buyers to come on board early, to smoothen the transition to a mandatory one by 2022.Mr Louis Ng asked about extending the PWM to foreigners in the lift industry. The intent of the PWM is to build a strong local core for the lift industry and not to discriminate against foreigners. So, Mr Ng will be happy to know that several lift firms that have committed to implementing the PWM have also indicated that they provide their foreign lift technicians with comparable remuneration packages. BCA will require all lift technicians, including the foreigners, to be certified for the various competency levels in the PWM, and we will encourage lift companies to also incorporate other PWM principles for their foreign lift technicians as well. So, as they improve their skill-sets, competencies and productivity, their wages will also go up. So, it has to be commensurate with the skillsets and skill pathways.Beyond the PWM, we also agree with Mr Zainal and Mr Ng on the need to improve the working conditions in the lift sector. BCA is working with the industry for new lifts to be designed with better working conditions for lift technicians as part of the work of the Tripartite Cluster for the Lift and Escalator Industry, which Mr Zainal chairs. So, Mr Zainal, it is in your hands. For example, I understand that the Committee is looking at measures relating to improving minimum illumination levels and mechanical ventilation in the lift shaft so that lift technicians can work in a cooler, brightly lit environment. And for existing lifts, we encourage lift owners to proactively incorporate these improvements as part of their planned upgrading or modernisation works. Yes, the Tripartite Cluster can do its part and, certainly, we look forward to Mr Zainal's recommendations.On Mr Zainal's specific point, I would like to clarify that clause 20 of the Bill allows the Commissioner of Building Control to issue orders in respect of lifts to prevent safety incidents and not to improve working conditions.So, as we raise wages and improve the working environment, we will also improve the safety and productivity of the L&E industry through the use of technology, as suggested by many Members who have spoken today. One way is to use remote monitoring and diagnostics (RM&D), which enable lift contractors to not only monitor lift operations in real time remotely, but also to troubleshoot and diagnose faults with greater accuracy.Such systems are being used in some other countries in Europe and BCA is exploring with the industry how this can be applied in our local context. For example, BCA is working to develop a common standard for these systems that will facilitate more pervasive deployment of such technologies.If successfully deployed in Singapore, RM&D technology could enable us to shift to a use-based or predictive maintenance regime, as suggested by Mr Zainal and Er Dr Lee. Today, it is very rigid in terms of monthly inspections. But that is because we do not have ways in which we can measure how often the lift is used and how far it travels. So, I think, with technology, we are able to do it better and, therefore, we can assess how soon or how often your lifts need to be maintained much more accurately.RM&D can also change the way lift technicians work in the future. A technician will be able to monitor all the lifts under his charge from a remote location and in real time. So, when a fault occurs, the system will provide the technician with the necessary information to diagnose the fault and to attend to it immediately. This will reduce the amount of time that the lift technician is required to spend doing maintenance work on site, which not only makes his job safer but also enables him to maintain a larger number of lifts, thus raising his productivity. I think all these fit into the whole PWM narrative in which you want to see greater productivity, you want to see greater skill-sets and improved working conditions. Therefore, I think you can see the rationale of why we are localising this set of jobs and taking it to the future. We want more Singaporeans to come on board.Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about how we can ensure the adequacy of lift parts in order to meet the maintenance requirements under the Act, for example, by setting up a national storage for such parts. We agree that it is important for lift faults to be rectified in a timely manner. However, having a centralised storage of the various lift parts from different manufacturers and across different models is neither practical norcost-effective. It is going to be difficult. Instead, owners can take a preventive approach towards maintenance by planning ahead and scheduling replacement of lift components early, before they cause any issues. The RM&D systems I spoke about earlier have the potential to help owners to do better.Mr Zainal Sapari also raised concerns about major players exerting proprietary rights over their spare parts and asked if we could adopt the EU's practice of encouraging open and non-proprietary lift systems. We understand that EU prohibits companies from restricting the sale of spare parts to other companies and we have similar laws in Singapore that can deal with refusals to supply essential parts. So, I think it would not be practical to legislate that lift systems must be open and non-proprietary because doing so would severely limit the selection of lifts available to Singapore, given the lift designs of many of our international lift are actually quite proprietary. Just like cars, it is very hard to interchange your parts between a Honda, Kia and Volkswagen, for example. So, you have to also be mindful that there are very few of such models around.On Mechanised Car Parking Systems (MCPS), we agree with Er Dr Lee that they should be properly installed and maintained. There are about 260 MCPS today in Singapore, and 10 or less MCPS were installed annually in recent years. So, the numbers are not huge. But BCA will work out the details of the MCPS regulatory regime and consult the industry further on the requirements for contractors and technicians.On Mr Gan's question on HDB's procurement of lifts, while it is not relevant to the Bill, we should ask MOF on how you procure lifts in bulk. But I would like to assure the Member that HDB does enjoy the economies of scale in its lift procurement. Each tender covers about 300 lifts, which is large by industry standards.Sir, I thank Members for their support of these amendments, which seek to reinforce our Building Control Act by strengthening the building regulatory control framework and to improve the building accessibility in our built environment. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.3.23 pmMr Deputy Speaker: Yes, Er Lee Bee Wah. No five clarifications, please.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah: Thank you, Sir, only one. Nee Soon Town Council has been using drones to do facade inspection. But, lately, there was this restriction imposed. The drones can only be used during the weekend. So, I was wondering can MND work out with CAAS to address their concern so that we can be more productive?Mr Zaqy Mohamad: Sir, I thank the Member for her question. Certainly, we can look at this. It is in our interest, in fact, to leverage more on technology and leverage more things like drones, for example, so that we minimise thecost to Town Councils to have to put up gondolas each time. Let us work this out. And certainly, as we expand the regulations to more Town Councils and across the board, I think this is where we can certainly do better.Mr Deputy Speaker: Ms Joan Pereira.Ms Joan Pereira: I thank the Minister of State. I think I asked about higher insurance coverage for the workers. Can the Minister of State please explain?Mr Zaqy Mohamad: That is actually an MOM question but never mind. If they are injured, they can claim under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA). Under the WICA, you can actually claim. So, whether they have insurance or not, it is claimable.Mr Deputy Speaker: Mr Zainal Sapari.Mr Zainal Sapari: Mr Deputy Speaker, before I ask my question, I would like to tender my apologies to Mr Louis Ng for referring to him as a fellow Labour Member of Parliament, but he is most welcomed to join us.My question is, given the fact that we have 70,000 lifts and we are trying to improve the working conditions, I think the initial estimate for retrofitting existing lifts can actually be very expensive. I was wondering whether MND has plans to subsidise thecost of retrofitting these lifts to make sure that we can actually create an environment conducive for the L&E technicians to work in.Mr Zaqy Mohamad: I understand that is being worked on by your Cluster Committee. So, we will wait for your recommendations.Mr Deputy Speaker: Alright. Are there any more clarifications? That is a very good taichi.Question put, and agreed to.Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. – [Mr Zaqy Mohamad].Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed."

I dedicate my speech today to two important issues close to my heart, care-giving and ending sexual violence. It is my hope in 2020 that we dedicate more attention to addressing these critical issues and make greater strides towards a more inclusive society and a safer society for all.Today, my parents are 65. They lead active lives, but ten years down the road, their lives could possibly be very different as they enter their golden years. As a child to my ageing parents, the prospect of assuming some care-giving responsibilities sometime in the near future weighs on my mind. I am hardly alone in this. Around me, peers of my age share similar concerns. The old age dependency ratio in Singapore has been declining over the decades. In 1990, it was 10.5 younger person to an elderly person. In 2019, the ratio has halved to 4.5. As our loved ones grow older, there are fewer of us to share the labour and responsibilities of care-giving with.How will we continue to lead the lives we have when we potentially also have to be care-givers? Would our work schedules allow us to juggle work and care? Would we be able to afford hiring professional help? What other options are there for our parents to age with dignity?For women, the pressures are felt even more acutely as societal norms continue to promote care-giving as women's responsibility. A 2011 national survey on care-giving for elderly individuals, those above 75 years old, requiring help with at least one activity of daily living found that 97.9% of all informal care-givers in Singapore are immediate family members, with more of them being female and between 45 and 59 years old. The female care-givers are also usually wives or adult daughters of the care recipient.The pressure on women to be care-givers has a great impact on their ability to engage in paid work. In 2018, over 280,000 women were outside the labour force primarily because of care-giving to relatives or family members apart from children. In comparison, just over 15,000 men cited the same reason for being outside the labour force. The compromises that women make to their work lives negatively impacts their financial security. According to CPF statistics, about four in 10 active CPF members who turned 55 in 2017 did not meet the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) of $83,000 in their Retirement Accounts.Among them, women have more difficulty meeting the BRS. Similarly, a recent study shows that female family care-givers to older persons experienced a change in work situation because of care-giving, suffering a 63% loss in income on average which translated into an average annual loss of more than $50,000.Ask any care-giver around you and you will know that it demands a great deal of energy, time, resources and attention. You could find yourself waking up several times throughout the night to attend to your loved ones' needs, or having to spend hours persuading them to take their medication, or even straining your back trying to physically move them. For the hundreds of thousands of care-givers out there, stress, burnout and feelings of resentment may not be uncommon. Not only do they have to contend with the physical stress of care-giving, they are also struggling to balance the demands of paid work and dealing with care-related expenses which they are also now responsible for.When you become a care-giver, it very often becomes the central identity and the focal point of your life, and you find that the other aspects of your life: your job, your friends, your hobbies, your leisure time, have to accommodate care-giving, not the other way around.How can we better redistribute care-giving responsibilities between men and women, but also between the family, community and state? How can we as a society ensure that care-givers are not compromising on their own health and financial security as they carry out this often invisible and thankless work?Over the years, the Government has introduced numerous policies to support family care-givers, including most recently the Caregiver Support Action Plan. Many of these initiatives, such as the subsidies for long-term care services and foreign domestic worker levy, have no doubt been of tremendous help to those who benefited from them. However, I believe that our efforts can still be strengthened and would call for even bolder moves.To start, we need up-to-date and more robust data on care-givers in Singapore. The last national survey on informal care-giving was conducted almost a decade ago. There should be regular systematic tracking of the number of care-givers in order to understand the scale of challenges they are facing.Next, I highlight two workplace policy suggestions that have been raised by various experts and civil society organisations like the Singapore Alliance of Women in Ageing.Workplaces need to accommodate care, not the other way around when we recognise and accept the fact that all workers, including those who are employers, will likely find themselves with care-giving responsibilities at some point in their lives. Can we consider legislating the right for employees to request for Flexible Work Arrangements (FWA)? Such legislation has already been successfully introduced in the UK, New Zealand, Canada and Australia.Research shows that current utilisation of flexible work arrangements is low due to bias by middle management and requirements for \"facetime\" at the office for performance appraisal, bias against part-timers and reluctance to change the status quo. Without equal mandated access, those most in need, like care-givers, are likely to be denied access to FWA and will have no choice but to exit the workforce.Second, childcare leave should be converted to family care leave so that all workers have the option to utilise it for their dependents. Those with children and other older dependents should be given a longer quantum of leave. Unpaid care-giving leave is not sufficient for care-givers as they must use up their own personal and medical leave, leading to care-giver burnout and health problems. Currently, family leave that allows for care-giving of relatives is voluntary, unlike childcare leave that is mandated at six days paid per parent for Singapore Citizens.In 2018, only 20% of companies offered some type of paid family care leave. Finally, we need to continue expanding care options. Whether it is through hiring a professional homecare nurse, going to a daycare centre or living in a retirement home. We need to make these options affordable for families. According to a local study, they found that lower, middle-income households would spend between 23% and 59% of their household income on long-term care services after subsidies. The figures are 24% to 63% for upper middle income households. I hope the Government can review the subsidies system to ensure that thecost of these services are not prohibitively high to families, including middle income ones.On to the next topic, having just graduated from SMU in the recent years, I am particularly concerned about the recent spate in campus sexual violence cases as well as how the use of technology has enabled new forms of sexual violence to be committed. This next part of my speech would focus on how we can better address these two forms of violence. But first, I would stress the importance that sex education plays in ending violence against women.Efforts to address sexual violence are usually focused on legislation, punishment and remedying the effects for survivors. However, there is a crucial need to address social norms and attitudes which enable sexual violence. The prevalence of sexual violence, committed overwhelmingly by men against women, reveals an ugly truth about the way society views women: that women are not human. Sexual violence is fundamentally rooted in the idea that women are objects, devoid of agency, rights and feelings, that women exist for men's pleasure, that women are not equal to men.Education on consent, sexual violence, gender equality, is therefore absolutely necessary to transform society's understanding and views for the better. In this vein, I believe that the sexuality education children and young persons receive in schools is a powerful tool to catalyse change from young.Is the current sexuality education curriculum reflective of and relatable to young people's experiences with sex, sexuality and gender-based violence today? Are students themselves consulted to find what they need and want to learn from sexuality education? What needs and gaps in knowledge do they have that are not being met by the curriculum?According to the United Nations, comprehensive sexuality education, apart from providing scientifically accurate information about sexual and reproductive health, also importantly includes discussion about gender roles, human rights, gender equality and threats such as discrimination and sexual violence. Our sexuality education syllabus should be inclusive and explicitly address these topics.I now turn my attention to campus sexual violence. News headlines have recently been dominated by sexual offences committed within education institutions. From the Academic Year 2015/2016 to 2017/2018, 56 cases of sexual misconduct were reported to Autonomous Universities in Singapore and 37 of these cases were reported to the Police. Given the stigma around sexual violence, it is reasonable to assume that many more of such cases go unreported.Students have a right to feel safe in schools. In 2016, it was asked if MOE would formulate guidelines and provide anti-harassment training to staff in tertiary institutions in Singapore, based on the recommendations of the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment. Then, they responded that institution-specific codes of conduct were already in place to prevent harassment on campuses across the nation.However, in the wake of Monica Baey's brave sharing last year, it has become apparent that relying on individual institutions to develop their own policies and protocols is often inadequate. There is an uneven level of protection across institutions, with differing definitions of what constitutes harassment, and varying complaint, investigation and disciplinary processes. This means that whether students get their case investigated, how it will be investigated and what the outcome may be, and what support they receive as victims would differ, depending on where they go to school. This should not be the case. Violence is violence, and should be dealt with in the same way, regardless of institution setting.Therefore, I believe the way forward is for the development of a national code or guideline addressing campus sexual violence that all education institutions can adopt. This code should set out the duties of the schools to ensure zero tolerance of sexual harassment, provide adequate victim-care support and set out standards and principles for investigating and managing complaints.Another worrying trend is the rise of sexual violence involving the use of technology, such as social media, spy-cameras and mobile recording devices. According to AWARE, the number of technology-facilitated sexual violence cases they have seen had increased threefold in the last three years. In 2018, they saw 124 cases, more than half of which involved sexual images of the survivors that were non-consensually shared, obtained or created.The effects of technology-facilitated sexual violence on the survivor can be just as traumatic as other forms of sexual violence. Having one’s privacy being invaded and intimate images of themselves shared publicly without consent renders a distressing sense of helplessness. Even with the successful conviction of the perpetrator, the traumatic effects of having one’s intimate images and recordings still circulating in the public domain will still be felt by survivors. I hope that survivors of such offences can be better protected.Perhaps mechanisms could be set up for the swift removal of non-consensually shared intimate materials, even before conviction. In Australia, complaints about one’s intimate recording being shared non-consensually can be made to the eSafety Commissioner online. The Commissioner is then empowered to issue removal notices for the end-user or service provider to remove the materials in question within 48 hours. We should consider having such a similar mechanism in place.I hope that Deputy Prime Minister Heng and the team behind the Budget will take these suggestions into consideration.12.33 pmMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): \"Daddy, why don't I take the school bus so that you do not need to rush anymore?\" Those words by my daughter Ella cut through my heart like a knife. My six-year-old daughter taught me an important lesson that morning when I was sending her to school last year, a very painful lesson. She made me realise that it was time to slow down and not rush all the time, especially in front of her, how my actions had made her feel bad and a reminder about how precious time is.\"Spend time with those you love, one of these days you will either say I wish I had or I'm glad I did\". I used this quote in this House a few years ago and I am sharing it again not just because it is a beautiful quote to live by but also as a timely reminder to myself and to all of us.I do enjoy sending Ella to school. I love singing all the Disney songs with her on the way to school, I love listening to her talk about her dreams, how she was at the ice palace and enchanted forest and met Elsa. I love listening to all the gossips and playground politics in her school and, my goodness, there is so much politics. But, most of all, I love just spending time with her, precious Daddy-Ella time. Time we can never get back.Sir, we gave out a lot in this year's Budget, helping our workers, enterprises, parents and their children, seniors and our environment. Many are appreciative of Budget 2020 but if there is one thing we did not give out, it is time. Time, which is priceless and time which our Government can give out.We need more precious time with our loved ones. We need more time with our children who desperately need us. I am glad we provide childcare leave, which \"will provide sufficient time for working parents to care for and spend quality time with their children\".But it has been more than a decade since childcare leave provisions were increased and it is time to review this again. Are the current six days sufficient? We already know that the vast majority of childcare centres have six days of annual closure. This means that, for most parents, the entire six days of childcare leave could be used just for these annual closures. Let us not forget about the additional three half-day closures on the eve of any of the five stipulated public holidays. What happens when your child falls sick or for any other times when childcare leave is needed?Sir, my first suggestion is that we have specific childcare sick leave. Applications for such leave must be supported by a medical certificate. This is much needed as parents should be there to look after their children when they are sick. Out of all the illnesses, including chicken pox, influenza, stomach flu and the list goes on, let me focus on the Hand Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) as an example of why we need more childcare leave.In Singapore, 90% of children have had HFMD infection by 12 years of age. This is something almost all parents face and we should help them. We must help. It is extremely difficult for parents to find help to look after their children as the infection can last for up to two weeks. It is also hard to find someone to look after your child as the care-giver has a good chance of being infected. I was infected by my children when they had HFMD.From the employers' standpoint, do they really want their employee who may also be infected to come to the office and possibly spread the disease or any other illness to other employees, resulting in everyone going on medical leave? Also, do we honestly think that the employee can concentrate at work and be productive? Would they not be worrying about their child who is sick? How is this beneficial to the company? Having childcare sick leave will help the children, the parents and, ultimately, the employers.Sir, my second suggestion is that we provide this childcare sick leave on a per-child basis. Our current childcare leave does not make sense. Surely, we can all agree here that if you need six days of childcare leave for one child, you cannot also only need six days of childcare leave for two, three or four children. It may make sense if you can make sure all your children fall sick at the same time, which is not quite possible.Sir, having childcare sick leave and having it on a per-child basis is not something foreign to this Government. The Public Service, one of the largest employers in Singapore, already gives some officers childcare sick leave and it is on a per-child basis. For example, officers with two children, one of whom is below age seven is eligible for four days of childcare leave per year with MC. An officer with three or more children, has nine days of childcare leave per year with MC. This is on top of the six days of childcare leave per year.The Government clearly feels that childcare leave is important for people who work for the Government, why then would it not be important for the people we serve? Let us level the playing field.There may be an argument that giving more childcare leave can inadvertently affect the employment prospects of parents with more children. But this is not the case for the Public Service and, surely, this cannot be a reason for us to not do what is right for our people. Surely, the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices can be used to address this concern.If we want Singaporeans to have kids and have more kids, then we need to give them more time to look after and be with their children. It is not just about making pre-school more affordable. That is important. But many I spoke to feel that if they are going to have kids but just leave them at childcare centres most of the time, then what is the point of having kids? We are trying hard to increase our TFR and beyond looking at the dollars and cents, we also need to look into providing parents with more time to spend with their children.The reply to my suggestions might be that we rather focus on flexible work arrangements. But this is not a zero-sum game. We can work on providing more flexible working arrangements for our people but also legislate more childcare leave.Sir, Deputy Speaker Charles Chong gave me one of the best advices just before the last General Elections. I used to help out at his Meet-the-People Session (MPS) and he always made sure I go home as early as possible once MPS ended. He said to me, \"Louis, make sure you don’t go home one day and your daughter calls you uncle!\". That advice is not just for me but for everyone and a timely reminder that while we work hard, we should also spend quality time with our loved ones. And it is not just about spending time with our children but also with our parents.Sir, I am glad that all civil servants are eligible for up to two days of parent-care leave per year and that a growing number of civil servants are using both days of leave. The Government has stated, \"With a rapidly ageing population and smaller family units, officers with elderly parents will need time to take care of them. The new parent-care leave reflects our position as a family-friendly employer.\"It is encouraging that an increasing number of private companies are providing this. In 2018, 20% of private sector companies offered such leave benefits, up from 15% in 2012. But 20% is still really a small percentage.Our parents are the reason we are here today. They worked hard to bring us up and looked after us when we were young. We should be there for them when they are aging and now need us to look after them.Sir, I lost my Dad five years ago. On 11 May 2015, I was getting ready to go to work and I told my wife I was going to inform the ACRES team that I needed to take some time off to spend with my Dad who was in hospital. I was already visiting him every day but I decided I should spend more time with him. As I was about to leave my house, my sister called and told me that Daddy had lost consciousness. He passed away that day. I really wish I can turn back time. I made a mistake and I regret it till today. I wish I had spent more time with Daddy and I miss him dearly.Perhaps, through sharing this with everyone, this wound might finally heal and, through sharing, I hope that others will not make the same mistake I made. Spend time with those you love and remember that life is a one-way ticket.Sir, this Government recognises that we need to spend time to look after our parents. It has been eight years since we introduced parent-care leave in the Civil Service and it is now time for everyone else to have this. It is time to legislate it.The Government's statement: \"With a rapidly ageing population and smaller family units, officers with elderly parents will need time to take care of them\", holds true for all of us and not just civil servants. If the Government feels that it is important for civil servants to have parent-care leave, then why not others? We are a family-friendly employer and now we should be a family-friendly Government.I understand that the tripartite partners have also encouraged more employers to adopt the Tripartite Standard on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, regardless of whether they already provide parent-care leave. But this is unpaid leave. Why do civil servants get paid parent-care leave and others have unpaid leave? Again, can we level this playing field?I also understand that care-givers have given feedback that they prefer flexible work arrangements over parental leave as a more sustainable way to balance work and care-giving responsibilities. But the parent-care leave we provide to everyone can, again, be the same as those provided to civil servants where they have the flexibility to take this leave in full or half-day blocks. This will address the feedback we have received and, if we want to, we can take it a step further and offer parent-care leave in blocks of hours. It is, ultimately, a personal choice to take leave to spend time with those you love but this Government can help make things easier for employees and I hope we do so.Sir, the Prime Minister said a few months ago that, \"We will always stand with workers (and) ensure your well-being. We will always do our best to help you and your children progress with Singapore and have a better life\". Let us also stand with our workers when it comes to childcare leave and parent-care leave.Time is the most precious commodity. I hope this Budget is not just about the economy but also about giving our people precious time to rest and to spend with their loved ones.In conclusion, I hope that we can (a) introduce a new childcare sick leave; (b) provide this childcare sick leave on a per-child basis; and (c) legislate the provision of parent-care leave.Minister Vivian Balakrishnan once said, \"Life is a one-way ticket. A baby will only remain a baby for a very short time. They will grow up before we even realise it. The thing about life is we cannot rewind time. So, my advice to young parents here is, your children need you, they need you desperately and they need you only for a very very transient time in their lives. If we miss it, we can never get it back.\"Sir, I thought I should end by saying that I am still sending my daughter to school and picking her up. A few months ago, she made a card in school for me and gave it to me when I picked her up. This time, she melted my heart with her words. She said, \"I love you, Daddy, because you always take me to school\".I am now a part-time school bus driver as I now have to send our twins, Katie and Poppy, to school as well. They, too, melt my heart with their words. I picked Poppy up the other day and she gave me a big hug and said, \"Daddy, I really missed you\". I look forward to more previous Daddy-Ella, Daddy-Katie and Daddy-Poppy time. I look forward to more hugs, more laughs and much more sweet words from them that give me that warm fuzzy feeling.Sir, let us give our people more precious time to spend with their loved ones. Thank you and I support this Budget.Mr Speaker: Mr Dennis Tan.12.44 pmMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Regrettably, I had to turn down my daughter's request to bring her to school today because I was rushing out to work. [Laughter.]Mr Speaker, Sir, during last year's Budget debates, I spoke of building resiliency in Singapore in economic and security matters. This year, I would like to devote my time to speak on environmental resiliency.The world today is at a crossroads facing down the existential threat of human-induced climate change. Over 11,000 scientists worldwide now warn that the world \"clearly and unequivocally faces a climate emergency\". Singapore's vulnerability to climate change is also evident. Our island is now being heated up twice as fast compared to the world and maximum temperatures, we are told, could reach 35 to 37 degree Celsius by the year 2100.Many countries seek to take concrete action. One in 10 people on the planet now live in a place that has declared a climate emergency and have effectively used it as a jumping point for real action. Inspired by young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, youths across the world are rising up and demanding immediate action to address the climate emergency we are facing. Singapore's recent SG Climate Rally is a cry for action from our youths, one that the leaders of today ought to heed.My colleagues and I in the Workers' Party have heard it loud and clear. We agree with them and have sought actively to raise concerns about climate change and the policies that can be taken by the Government. We are glad that some policies have been looked into and taken up.Yet, it would be prudent to recognise that there is a long way to go in building environmental resiliency in view of the lessons the world has learnt and is continuing to learn about our relationship with our environment. With the certainty of climate change, we, as a nation should be daring and set a bold Green Agenda to guide Singapore's trajectory of development. Please allow me to put forth some ideas to this House.We need a holistic view on climate emergency. We need a holistic response to all issues of climate change. In other words, the success of efforts to combat climate change must not solely be measured by the effectiveness of any one policy narrowly. We must also invest in and track efforts to address the wide-ranging impacts of climate change and our policies on society at large, whether be it on urban drainage systems, food security, water security, waste management, urban liveability or public health, to cite but a few impact areas.An example of this is coastal adaptation and flood protection. Thirty percent of Singapore's land area lies less than five metres above mean sea level. Even under an optimistic emissions scenario, there has been projected that sea level in Singapore could rise by about half a metre by 2100, posing a coastal flood risk. Therefore, the establishment of the new Coastal and Flood Protection Fund with an initial injection of $5 billion is a timely move.As the Government commits to investing more in coastal adaptation and flood protection though, where will this money be spent on? Will the money be invested in the best science so that better projections of sea level rise can be made for Singapore? Will investments be made in the best social science, so that the prioritisation of coastal land uses can be better assessed? Will soft-engineering, nature-based approaches such as the restoration of intertidal eco-systems, which have the potential to protect our coastlines be considered for use under this fund, or will only hard-engineering approaches such as polders and land reclamation be chosen? It would be useful if the Government could give a sense of its spending priorities in this regard.Preparing to adapt to climate change alone would be unwise. There must also be a move to mitigate climate change while we still can. Even as we have committed to the 36% cut on emissions intensity by 2030 in our first pledge, how have our efforts been to date? Perhaps the Government can provide an update.The Workers' Party also welcomes both the announcement by Minister Masagos Zulkifli at the Madrid Climate Conference last December that Singapore will submit its long-term Low Emissions Development Strategy soon, and the announcement by the Deputy Prime Minister that Singapore's commitment to the Paris Agreement will be updated this year. We look forward to the Government's updates, and to understand how they represent progress beyond our current commitments and strategies.Next, Greening out Transport Infrastructure. Climate change has also accelerated the need to calibrate Singapore's infrastructural development to meet environmental challenges. Transport is a major sector which requires such calibration. The Workers' Party therefore welcomethe Government phasing out all ICE vehicles by 2040. However, many practical EV issues are to be hammered out in the interim and I will like to ask what actions the Government will take on them.The biggest elephant in the room is on rebuilding an infrastructure currently tailored for ICE engines. The power grid in particular will be taxed. While Singapore is in a power glut now, electricity demand will only go up as Singapore moves on in its Smart Nation ambitions. One looks to Sweden with a ban on ICE vehicles slated for 2030, where demand for electricity is currently outgrowing capacity in local grids, forcing EV charging networks to compete with other infrastructure projects for electricity.This is not to mention that Singapore currently generates upward to 95% of its energy via natural gas. While it is the least-polluting fossil fuel and has higher efficiency compared to ICE vehicles, there will continue to be a carbon footprint generated. While our current power generation mix will improve by 2030 due to more solar capacity, how are we moving to lowering the carbon footprint of our power generation in 2030 – 2040?Also, with regard to charging points, the Government expects to have 28,000 charging points by 2030, but even assuming a 30% conversion from the current vehicle population to EVs, it still means about one charging point to 10 EVs by 2030. Should we even be contented with this ratio? Besides intelligent charging solutions, should the Government also consider the alternative of battery swap stations which have the advantage of speed, ensuring load on our power grid can be managed well, as well as providing a ready infrastructure for battery recycling? This has been tested in China and should be a key consideration here.How soon can we electrify our public bus and private hire infrastructure to EVs will also be important as many Singaporeans rely on such services. Would the Ministry of Transport give a timeline on this happening separately from the 2040 overall target?ASEAN cooperation is also needed if we are to successfully electrify our transport system. A key consideration here is Malaysia, where people and trade currently travel via the Causeway and the Tuas Second Link on ICE vehicles currently. If we do phase out ICE vehicles here, are we also implementing a ban on foreign ICE vehicles from entering Singapore? If there is no infrastructure in place in Malaysia to support commercial EVs, would that also impact our businesses with a top partner in trade?This is important to get right as, on one hand, foreign ICE vehicles and how we handle the issue, may have a significant impact on our EV plans, and on the other hand, we should not be seen to export our green problems away with unilateral bans. Indeed, we can work with Malaysia's state and federal authorities to build a sustainable and inclusive eco-system for EVs. To go one step further, we can propose an ASEAN Autonomous Vehicle and Electric Vehicle project that holistically looks at all the challenges of EVs that my colleague, Mr Leon Perera had previously mooted in this House. This will help to focus minds towards a target and benefits interconnectivity across the region.The effective solving of these issues I have highlighted in the adoption of EVs can turn us into the bellwether state in ASEAN for EV adoption, just as Norway is for both the Nordic region and the world.Next, Green Housing Initiatives. Housing is another area where calibration is required. If urban planning is right, we can reduce the Urban Heat Island effect, increase energy-efficiency and promote better waste management in our towns.We therefore welcome the HDB Green Towns Programme as it encourages sustainable living. However, will the benefits afforded by this concept be accessible only to new towns, or will our current HDB estates in places such as Hougang and Aljunied be retroactively upgraded to enjoy these benefits?We should also not forget about private properties and improving green efforts there. Even as they make up around 21% of the total resident households in Singapore, they account for 41.4% of the total electricity consumed in 2018. Therefore, improved greening efforts there can help net bigger gains. Would the Government consider expanding the Estate Upgrading Programme to include greening items for private estates? This may include solar-friendly installations in common areas and greening up shelters or building community gardens that act as carbon sinks.Also, could there be further incentives to push for solar installations across private households that allow excess power to be sold back to the power grid? Currently, payment is made by way of a credit adjustment based on the prevailing nodal prices. However, there does not seem to be incentives beyond that for private households. If private property owners can buy in to such plans, this can help us reach the 2 GWp capacity target sooner and give further sustainability and robustness to our power grid.Let us next talk about Protecting our Green Areas and Redefining Development. In addition to gearing up our economy and infrastructure to prepare for the climate emergency, it is worthwhile to ask ourselves whether we are doing our best to reap the benefits of environmental sustainability for our society.The Government often lauds its green accomplishments under the City in a Garden paradigm – on increasing accessibility to parks, on the upkeep of community gardens, and on projects like Gardens by the Bay, for example. Each of these efforts bear their own positive outcomes for environmental education, community involvement, ecotourism, and liveability. But, amidst the continual urban greening of Singapore, are we prepared to risk undermining the benefits provided by the relatively more natural and more sensitive green eco-systems in our country?These eco-systems benefit us in a plethora of ways – from helping us store carbon and cool Singapore, thus aiding our response to climate change, to acting as havens for biodiversity with educational value. In addition to their potential as sites for low-impact, sustainable eco-tourism, they provide Singaporeans with recreational value and with relief from our stressful urban environment – a benefit that is much harder to quantify but is nonetheless important.Already, an NParks study indicated that Singapore's land became a net carbon emitter in 2014. Over the past few years, we have seen the prioritisation of development projects over the benefits afforded by sensitive eco-systems due to such projects as the Cross Island Line, the Tengah HDB project and the Mandai Project. The latter two of these have been styled as a \"forest town\" project and a \"nature destination\", respectively.Thankfully, environmental groups, academics and public agencies have come together seeking to reduce the negative impacts these projects will have on the environment, in particular on our local biodiversity and forest cover, even after mitigation measures. However, the question remains whether the Government will commit to securing the inviolability of our nature reserves and greater protection of the little that is left of our more natural, green eco-systems in the future, while finding better ways to plan land use for housing, transport and tourism. I will speak more on this in MEWR's Committee of Supply (COS) debate next week.I will now move to Shifting Mindsets. Beyond good policy, Singaporeans also need to come together in buying in to this Green Agenda. Mindsets must shift in the way we consume, to only use what we need to use. Just to cite a common example: single-use plastic bags. Can we take or use what we really need? Can we pack more things into each plastic bag? Do we really need to double bag all our groceries at the checkouts? If we only need to use say, one or two plastic bags for refuse disposal a day, do we need to take 20 bags from the supermarket a week? We can also reduce the number of single use plastic bags we need to take for our refuse by concurrently using good quality re-usable shopping bags. We may end up using fewer single-use plastic bags and may still have enough bags for our refuse.To encourage Singaporeans, we should ramp up our public education to reach out to Singaporeans of all ages and educational level and in different languages. We should even encourage easy accessibility to the latest research on climate change by the average citizen. Translating this research into readable, digestible commentaries for Singaporeans gives further buy-in and builds awareness.As the lead Government agency on climate change, the National Climate Change Secretariat should consider working with public and private research agencies and researchers on this so that easy-to-access facts and evidence on climate change can be in the public domain to build further buy-in for green policies.Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, Singapore's environmental resiliency is being tested in ways unprecedented. We should spare no effort to lead the region and the world in this effort, not only as an honest broker but also as an innovator in the space. As such, a bold Green Agenda should be considered as Singapore moves to the next chapter of nation-building. We owe it to our future generations to do so.Mr Speaker: Mr Cedric Foo.1.00 pmMr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer): Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore's success is evident. Whether it is the PISA scores of our 15-year-olds, our economic competitiveness, our healthcare outcomes, our CPF system or our public housing, the world looks to us as a model of a highly-functioning and thriving country. To be sure, we are still a young nation and we too, look to other nations for examples of how to do better here.Singapore's per capita income was about S$1,600 when we became independent in 1965 – just S$1,600. Today, our per capita income is about S$90,000 (in 2019). This is more than a 50-fold increase in a short span of 54 years. Put it another way, we have achieved a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about 8% on average, each and every year over the last 54 years.How did we manage to do this? I believe the pre-conditions of success are, firstly, the peace and stability afforded us by an effective MFA, our SAF and our Home Team. Beyond that, an effective and honest government, which is sometimes quite rare, and working hand-in-hand with our employers and workers.These pre-conditions are necessary but not sufficient. I can think of two key principles that have served us well and have brought us here.The first is fiscal prudence. Achieving fiscal prudence starts with having a balanced budget during every term of Government. Unlike in many other countries, Singapore has been building up its reserves, instead of running deficits. How we achieve this is to ensure that recurrent revenue – those that are built into our system and are not one-off in nature – equals to or exceeds recurrent expenditures – those that we expect to incur year after year after year and not one-off in nature. So, recurrent revenue must equal or exceed recurrent expenses. That is a formula for a balanced Budget and that is very important for fiscal prudence.As pointed out in this House, Singapore is facing rising health carecosts for two reasons – advances in medical technology and, specific to Singapore, a very rapidly ageing population. And also because we did so well in healthcare, our life expectancy is getting longer and that also mean that medicalcosts will go up.Singapore’s healthcare expenditure is budgeted at S$13.4 billion for this year's Budget and that is an increase of 16% just from last year's Budget. This figure is expected to further increase over the next decade for the reasons I cited. This means that we have to address such increase in healthcarecosts soon if we do not want to kick the can down the road for a future government to deal with, and to do so, in a way, by using recurring revenue because rising healthcarecosts is a recurring expenditure.Therefore, the Finance Minister has recommended a GST rate increase of two percentage points to take place between 2022 and 2025.Now, the need for more recurring revenue becomes even clearer if we also consider two other risks to our fiscal revenues.First, our Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) and, secondly, the OECD's proposed Base Erosion and Profit Shifting's (BEPS) regime.First, let me talk about the risk of a lower NIRC. Today, the Net Investment Returns Contribution from our reserves is the biggest component of our revenue. In fact, NIRC is expected to be S$17 billion in our 2020 Budget, but lower than the S$19 billion in FY2019. Going forward, it will be increasingly challenging to achieve similarly high NIRC due to the very low interest rate environment all around the world. In fact, last night's 10-year treasury is about 1.35%. So, 1.35% for 10 year's money. In some other countries like Germany, Switzerland, Japan and so forth, they are even experiencing negative interest rates.GIC's mission is to beat inflation by investing in non-Singapore dollar assets and one of the instruments that they would use would be bonds. And if interest rates remain low, the risk of achieving high NIRC over the next decade or so, may become more challenging.Secondly there is a proposed OECD Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS) regime. What it means is that the OECD seeks to change the current corporate tax system from one which is based on the \"residency of the company\". So, if you are a company incorporated in Singapore, you pay taxes here. If this company has a subsidiary in the UK, it pays taxes in the UK. The proposal here is to change that concept of \"residency of the company\" to one where the \"consumer is based\". So, even if you are a company based in Singapore but if you sell digital services or other products or services to another country, say, in the United States, which has a large consumer base, then the US will be the country collecting the taxes.Singapore is a small hub economy with a lower consumer base compared to larger economies with higher consumption. Should the OECD's BEPS proposal be adopted, we could end up with lower corporate tax revenues.So, the two risks are our NIRC, facing challenges to generate high returns and, secondly, if the OECD's BEPS is adopted, then our corporate tax revenue will be negatively affected.It is understandable that raising GST is very unpopular. But as an honest Government, we need to level with our people and we need to continue to abide by the principle of fiscal prudence, having recurring revenue matching or exceeding recurring expenses. And this is the formula which has secured Singapore's success so far and we should not throw that away. Of course, this Government can ignore it because I do not think we will run into deep problems any time soon. But this is like kicking the can down the road and letting future generations deal with the problems. I do not think this is the right way forward.However, I hope that the Finance Minister, when raising GST, would design the Assurance Package in such a way that makes GST progressive. So, while we raise recurrent revenue, we also try to reduce the income inequality here in Singapore.But some have argued forget about raising GST. After all, we have big reserves. So, why not dip into it to fund our expenditure. Again, our reserves is finite and if we have recurring expenses, we need to think about recurring revenue in the system and not dip into a finite savings pool.But more important than that, we should not forget that Singapore is a country without natural resources. We have no oil, no natural gas, no minerals, no gold, no silver, the list goes on, we just have no natural resources, period! Our financial reserves is our only reserve. If we deplete it, Singapore has no fall-back. We have no back-stop facility to draw upon. We have no European Union equivalent to bail us out. And if we have to resort to the IMF as past examples have shown, we would have to go \"hat-in-hand\" and such rescue package will come with many, many onerous conditions that will bog us down for many, many years to come. This is not where we want to be.It is indeed the fiduciary duty of the government, as stewards, to ensure the fiscal sustainability and not to squander away the reserves, which, strictly speaking, we did not earn in totality but our forefathers and past governments have earned it for us. We inherited it. Therefore, squandering it would be leaving future generations ill equipped and vulnerable to deal with future crisis and to continue to bring Singapore forward.The second important principle other than fiscal prudence, is long-term planning. In fact, we should not look at Budget 2020 in isolation but we should look at all such government budgets across the years, you will see a theme emerging.This Government has over many years built up our infrastructure. Today, our tree-lined roads, our air and sea ports and our skyline are the envy of many. We are continuing with such long-term planning and are putting aside S$5 billion now to address rising sea levels and climate change. This is a problem that would probably only happen maybe in 100 years, maybe in 50 years, but this Government now, today, is dealing with this, and this is what long-term planning is about.The other sterling example is Marina Bay where we had to reclaim land, let it settle for 25 years, and then solving a water problem and also creating a beautiful skyline at the same time. And that would not have happened had we not adopted long-term planning.But beyond physical infrastructure, we also invested in digitalisation, which is a very important aspect of transforming our economy. Again, looking into the future, looking forward.Most importantly, for many years now, the second largest expenditure item in our Budget, after defence, has been education. Healthcare is catching up. This is testament to our commitment to develop Human Capital. In fact, many economists have said that investing in human capital is perhaps the best way forward. Because the more you invest in infrastructure, the more maintenancecost you will incur, and the risk of obsolescence is high. So, I am glad that we have put education right up there as the second biggest budget item in many, many budgets of the past.Equipping the Singaporean worker with the ability to be more productive and employable will enable them to earn higher wages. This is the best way to becoming a more equal society. Education affords social mobility. It gives hope and it allows our citizens to have a higher quality of living.In conclusion, I have talked about fiscal prudence and about why we should be careful – in fact, very, very careful – about dipping into our reserves. I have also talked about adopting a long-term planning horizon when it comes to government budgeting.But beyond these issues, this year’s Budget has also set aside an additional $4 billion to address short-term immediate challenges like cushioning the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. And I applaud the Deputy Prime Minister and the Finance Minister for looking into this.Although we do expect an overall Budget deficit of $10.9 billion for 2020, there is still a S$7.7 billion surplus for this term of Government commencing from 2015. Therefore, all the capital and operating expenditures as well as the government transfers including transfers into the Merdeka Generation (MG) package are all earned by the respective terms of government. And this is no mean feat. In fact, the total recurringcost of the Merdeka Generation package as well as the Pioneer Generation package are all paid for upfront and all earned by the respective terms of government.Mr Speaker, this is a Budget I believe we can all support! Thank you.Mr Speaker: Mr Darryl David.1.13 pmMr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio): Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not an exaggeration to say that we are living in somewhat unstable, uncertain times. The magnitude of global events have increased and the impact of these events are far-reaching. For example, just as the world saw a potential improvement in the global economic landscape last year with the inking of Phase 1 trade agreement between the United States and China, along came the COVID-19 virus to make an unforgettable impact on the international stage.The true impact of COVID-19 on countries and economies is hard to estimate, and it is likely that the long-tail impact of the outbreak could be significant. I am thus heartened to know that the Singapore Government has put forth an expansionary Budget to cushion the impact of COVID-19 and help Singapore-based companies and our citizens emerge stronger from this episode.The Government has come up with the Stability and Support Package to help key sectors of the economy – Tourism, Aviation, Retail, Food and Beverage, and Point-to-Point transport services – that are hit hardest by COVID-19. I am encouraged that the Budget will cater for tax and rental rebates to defray thecost of businesses, as well as wage-support schemes and training incentives to up-skill Singaporeans and keep Singaporeans employed during these difficult times.Based on current medical knowledge, COVID-19 is more infectious than SARS and current epidemiology models seem to predict that the outbreak is likely to last longer than SARS. But even when the worst is over, it will take many more months before it is \"business as usual\". Would the Government cater more funds to support businesses and Singaporeans if the downturn period turns out to last longer than expected? Also, will the Government consider extending help to other industries besides the five already mentioned in the Budget, if the economic fallout spreads to other industries?Moving on to the topic of supporting families, Mr Speaker, Sir, building on the momentum of the past few Budgets, the current Budget continues the trend of investing in our children and youth by enhancing the level of support for the pre-school and early childhood sector. In 2018, the Government committed $1 billion to the early childhood sector and I understand that it will invest almost twice this amount per year for the next few years to further support this sector.Part of this investment will be used to enhance grants to ensure that quality pre-school remains accessible and affordable for young parents and that every young Singaporean child will be able to have a good head start in education to maximise their potential and human capital gains regardless of their family's socio-economic situation.While we have raised the income eligibility for additional subsidiaries for the Kindergarten Fee Assistance Scheme (KiFAS) to $12,000 a month to benefit a larger number of families, would the Government consider putting in place more support and subsidy for after-school student care once the child graduates from pre-school and enters Primary school? I believe this will help support families especially by providing working parents alternative care arrangements for children while they are at workIt was announced in the Budget that over the next 10 years, the Government will also set up a Community Capability Trust of up to $350 million to support our Social Service Agencies (SSAs) to strengthen their organisational capabilities and enhance their levels of service provision. This is part of the overall effort to transform the social services sector so that the SSAs can better meet the complex needs of our evolving society, especially when Singapore is experiencing a rapidly ageing population. I believe that this is a step in the right direction towards building a more caring society.We also need to constantly encourage and incentivise our companies to employ people who are differently-abled. An example of one such company is Foreword Coffee that employs people with special needs as their baristas and cashiers or fast food restaurants that hire differently-abled individuals as wait staff and service staff.As announced in the Budget, the Enabling Employment Credit (EEC) will replace existing schemes to support the employment of differently-abled individuals by providing wage offsets for employers. Can we further incentivise companies to employ differently-abled individuals by providing more direct incentives to these companies, perhaps in the form of tax rebates? I believe these direct incentives will provide a strong impetus for companies to offer fair and equal employment opportunities to everyone.Mr Speaker, Sir, the theme of a caring society is a significant and powerful one. Indeed, the COVID-19 situation, though challenging, has brought out and continues to bring out some of the best behaviour from Singaporeans from all walks of life as Singaporeans and local communities have come forward to support their fellow citizens.Some have left masks and sanitisers at lift landings for their fellow residents. Others have come forward to organise food delivery and even social programmes for those who are under quarantine or those who have to stay at home. Many Singaporeans have also extended similar courtesies not only to their fellow countrymen, but also to the foreigners in our midst. NGOs have come forward to distribute masks and sanitisers to migrant workers, to educate them on proper hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the migrant communities and some have even raised funds for those who need it.These are examples of the indomitable spirit and resilience of our people. So, instead of sharing pictures of empty shelves at supermarkets or showing videos of residential storerooms that are stacked with hoarded goods, let us showcase more positive examples of how Singaporeans and Singaporean residents have rallied together to weather through this storm as one people.Mr Speaker, in many ways, this is a Budget for everyone and every segment of the society. More importantly, this is a Budget to help Singapore get through the economic uncertainties during COVID-19 and to ensure that we emerge stronger from this entire episode.The current Budget demonstrates the decisiveness of the Government and its commitment to Singapore and Singaporeans as it has acted quickly and decisively to come up with a budget to deal with the many challenges that have arisen due to COVID-19. I am thus confident that this Budget is well-designed for such extraordinary times and end my speech in support of the Budget.Mr Speaker: Ms Rahayu Mahzam.1.20 pmMs Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong): Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Budget reflects the Government's priorities and directions for the country. It has to be visionary to prepare our economy and our people for the future, but yet also address immediate needs. To me, the Budget is also an opportunity to nudge behaviours and shape norms. The Government's schemes and policies send an important signal on key issues and should encourage efforts that make Singapore better as a nation.For example, the support given to firms to train and redesign jobs for workers would hopefully translate to businesses and a workforce that is more productive and future-ready. Incentives for energy-efficient appliances or cleaner energy products should encourage better adoption of such products and in the long run create a greener Singapore. Support for employers to hire Singaporean persons with disabilities (PwDs) should encourage more to be inclusive and allow more space for PwDs to participate and contribute to the economy.I am always keen to see the initiatives in the Budget that will help shape our values as a people. I am happy to note that the Government is building on the efforts from previous years to build a caring and inclusive society. This year, the Government introduced the Enabling Employment Credit (EEC) to provide stronger support for employers of PwDs. The intent is to provide help for PwDs to find employment and remain in the workforce. To me, this is important as it is a signal to be inclusive and normalise PwDs' participation in our society.In recent years, I have had the great privilege of engaging with family members and care-givers of people with different abilities. There is a whole range of disabilities, including intellectual and physical disabilities, and PwDs come from a broad spectrum of age groups, from infants to the elderly. In my speech in 2018 on the Motion in support of inclusive education, I shared some of the challenges faced by parents of children with disabilities and called for more support for these families. Last year, as part of the PAP Women's Wing paper on supporting parenthood and families, my colleagues and I engaged many parents to hear their views on the support needed. Dr Intan Azura, Miss Cheryl Chan and I had carried out an online survey to get a sensing of the needs of these families and we also held a dialogue to hear their stories. We had to summarise much of the information we received to fit the paper, but we shared our insights with the relevant Ministries after the paper was finalised.Through this experience, we have found that: firstly, there is still a lack of awareness of the different types of support available for families with children with different needs. Secondly, there are specific circumstances in each family and thus the support extended needs to be more customised to be more meaningful. Some families, for example, may have more than one child with special needs and may need more support. Thirdly, the infrastructure and services available need to be more pervasive and accessible to families. Facilities, like playgrounds, should ideally be equipped for children with different abilities. We may have a few of such inclusive playgrounds but only in certain parts of Singapore. We also have a hub at Enabling Village in Bukit Merah where parents and care-givers could get assistance with some services. There is also a Care-givers' Pod in the village meant for the care-givers' use. However, those living in the east or north of Singapore may find it to be too far from them and are not able to benefit from the support and facilities available.Much have been done in the sector, through the Enabling Masterplans, various policies and schemes as well as through the formation of workgroups to review the support to address different aspects of disabilities. However, there is still some way to go in closing the gaps to better support PwDs and their families. More significantly, one theme that repeatedly comes up from the feedback from parents and family members is the need to build a culture of care and compassion towards PwDs. Parents especially, worry about the world they would be leaving their differently-abled children in when they pass away. Could their children be meaningfully integrated within the community and be given opportunities like others? Will the society be kind, patient and understanding of their child's needs? Will they be taken advantage of? Will someone stand up for their rights?There is, therefore, a fervent hope that the Government continues to make effort to create awareness, build infrastructure and implement policies that would normalise inclusiveness and allow for people with different needs and abilities to be truly embraced as part of the community. This may sound like a lofty ideal to some, but not one which we should shy away from. We need to constantly and relentlessly participate in such efforts and seek partners from amongst the community.In seeking for partners for causes that matter to humanity, I have found hope in the youths. I feel that the youth of today are very accepting of differences and have a strong sense of social fairness. Over the years, I have continued to be involved in the youth sector efforts especially through my engagements under M3, the collaboration between MESRA, MENDAKI and MUIS, and as a council member of National Youth Council. In my dialogues and discussions with young people, many of them have shown much desire for a more inclusive, more compassionate society. I am very heartened by their passion and I feel that it is so important to continue to engage them and seek their views as we build this nation.In this regard, I laud the Government's efforts through MCCY and the National Youth Council, to meaningfully engage our young people. Now more than ever, young people are given opportunities and are empowered to make the change they want to see. There are many support mechanisms, for example, through, the National Youth Fund, the SG Youth Action Plan and NYC's Young Changemakers Programme, which not only provide monetary grants but connect youths with mentors and like-minded peers to help implement ground-up projects.Aside from providing support to youths for their causes and to carry out their projects, it is also important to support them to achieve their aspirations. I note the provision in the Budget to ready our youths for various opportunities by providing more overseas exposure. This is very welcomed. I am hoping that many youths from different backgrounds can take up this opportunity. We should also continue to build on the efforts to support youth through empowerment and mentoring programmes.I oversee the youth engagement efforts under M3and one of the key initiatives is to create a culture of mentoring within the community so that the Malay/Muslim youths have somewhere to turn to for guidance as they navigate through challenges and choices in life. There are also resources like the MENDAKI Future-Ready Toolkit and the M3Resource Directory which are available online for youths to refer to for information on various matters. Mr Speaker, at this juncture, allow me to continue my speech in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]It is very important for us to continue engaging and supporting our youths because they are the next generation who will inherit our nation. We must empower them and help them achieve their aspirations. I oversee the third workgroup under M3related to youth matters, and one of the focus areas in our current projects is the development of a culture of mentoring within our community, so that our young can receive guidance and knowledge from those who are more experienced.This will hopefully help our youths grow their confidence and seize any available opportunity so that they can continue to progress. At the same time, we also encourage our youths to get involved and give back to society, regardless of race, religion or background. I hope that our community will continue supporting this effort and we can achieve our objective to develop youths who are highly competent, competitive, confident and show concern towards the people around them.(In English): Indeed, the efforts to empower, mentor and engage youths should continue. We should involve young people in discussion of key issues and policies and find opportunities to work with them to create positive social norms within the community. There should, therefore, be an appropriate budget allocated for these efforts as well as provision of the necessary platforms for them to implement their ideas and work with people from different ages and backgrounds. I believe that if we work together, we can harness our diverse strengths and bring Singapore to greater heights.It is akin to what we see here in Parliament. The Budget season is one of the more exciting periods for the House. The House is abuzz with anecdotes, findings and information about a myriad of issues. Members of this House pour our hearts and souls to the issues we champion because they matter to us, to the people we represent. I have seen the views that we raise in Parliament make their way to the formation of policies and I trust this will continue to be how the Singapore Government improves and builds on its framework for the future.This Budget is aptly named Our Unity Budget as we stand together, united by our desire to make Singapore stronger and better for generations to come. Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Budget.1.29 pmMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten): Mr Speaker, I support the Budget statement by Finance Minister. The past year has been a challenging year for many Singaporeans. Many businessmen whom I had spoken to lament about the slowdown in their business due to the on-going trade war between China and USA. They worry whether their business will be able to sustain in the long term.When the COVID-19 virus outbreak hit Singapore, it was an even greater blow to these businesses. MTI reduced its projected growth rate to a lower range of -0.5% to 1.5% for 2020. The drop in tourist figures, the fact that more Singaporeans are staying at home have affected the confidence of many.Thus, the expansionary Budget announced by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister last week is a real confidence booster.As stated by many in the media, the Budget was generous and provided for several measures to help affected Singaporeans and businesses cope with the economic slowdown. There were also many long-term measures to help affected Singaporeans prepare for the future.Individually, many Singaporeans are happy with the Care and Support Package of $1.6 billion because it puts money directly into their pockets. This will help alleviate thecost of living pressures for the residents. I support the principle that those who are lower income should receive more.I am also glad that the cash component of the Care and Support scheme is pegged to their income and not tied to the property type of the Singaporean. Last year, I had called on the Government to do away with distribution of Budget benefits based on home type alone. I believe this will benefit many retirees or seniors who are living in private properties but without any income. So, my appeal to the Government is to consider extending other benefits like the U-save vouchers and GST vouchers to retirees or seniors without income but staying in private properties. Again here I wish to stress to Minister – these retirees would not have income. The fact that they stay in private property does not in any way mean that they are rich or are able to sustain themselves. What they are looking for is also whether the Government can do more to recognise them for their contribution to nation building when they were younger.Sir, I also support the measures to help keep our workers employed. For many Singaporeans whom I meet, their main concern is whether they can get a good job which pays them commensurate with their skills and experience. Most workers prefer not to be on any form of welfare. Hence, the Jobs Support Scheme, the Wage Credit Scheme, the corporate tax rebate and the rental waivers for some of the tenants would help businesses to survive the economic slowdown and allow them to retain their staff.I am also pleased that the Finance Minister had remembered the hawkers in the food centres and markets. The majority of such stall licensees are small businesses and the rental waiver for them would go a long way to helping them sustain their small businesses during such trying times when the food centres are quieter and business has dropped drastically for themHowever, in the long term, what is important is not just cash handouts to affected Singaporeans or tax rebates to help businesses tide over difficult times. These payments cannot be permanent and moneys will eventually run out some day. Thus, I support the Government's emphasis on helping business to transform and grow; to help our workers to upgrade and learn new skills; to help our students venture overseas so as to be better equipped to face challenges in the future.This is akin to the old Chinese saying that if \"you give a man one fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach him how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.\" We must not ease our efforts in pushing our local enterprises to change and grow into efficient and competitive businesses that can make Singapore proud. I long for the day when Singapore can boast of our own large corporations like Alibaba, Samsung, Apple and Google.Sir, I have three points for the Government's consideration.I support the provision of Enhanced Housing Grant (EHG) to first-time flat buyers. The purpose of the Enhanced Housing Grant is to allow Singaporeans to own their own home and this is important for nation building. However, the quantum of EHG given is currently based on the monthly income of the flat buyer. If the applicant’s income is higher, the EHG will be lower. This means there is less incentive to buy a resale flat because you will get a lower EHG if your income is higher. This may result in Singaporeans with higher income always applying for a BTO flat where the subsidy will not change based on their income level.I urge the Government to review the tagging of the amount of EHG based on the income of the applicant. I also urge the Government to consider providing the EHG based on the per capital basis and not just based on gross income. Otherwise, a Singaporean who may have a higher income will get less EHG even though he may have more expenses and need to provide for more children or retired parents.Next, I appreciate the intent of the Government to help Singaporeans stay employable and to use the SkillsFuture Credit to learn new skills. However, may I ask the Finance Minister how many Singaporeans have not used the 2016 SkillsFuture Credit of $500. Are the unutilised figures within the expectation of the Government?Will the Government consider targeted useful courses that would help nudge Singaporeans to apply to use these funds to improve themselves to upgrade their skills? Otherwise, the 2016 and now the 2020 SkillsFuture Credit may remain untouched for a long period of time.Finally, in this year’s Budget, the expenditure for Healthcare has jumped to $13.4 billion. It now accounts for the second largest expenditure of the Government's Budget, just before Defence. And it used to be Education when the Minister for Finance was Minister for Education. I acknowledge that healthcarecosts have gone up and the recent COVID-19 outbreak has caused Singaporeans to be more aware of the need to ensure that our healthcare system works.Although Minister has assured us that the GST hike will not take place next year, the reality is that healthcarecosts will continue to rise. The Government needs to decide how to apportion the taxes which is collected and what resources to allocate into Healthcare as compared to Defence, Education, Housing and Transport.Nobody likes a tax hike, but Singaporeans must understand that increased spending on healthcare must come from somewhere. I urge the Government to reach out to more Singaporeans to help them learn about the GST offset packages which is intended to help the lower income cope with the GST eventual increase.Overall, I am of the view that this is a good Budget to take care of affected Singaporeans and to prepare the country for the future. It shows that the Government deeply cares for its citizens and the deferment of the GST increase is a clear signal that the Government is responsive to feedback from the citizens. Mr Speaker, I affirm my support for the Budget and wish to thank the Finance Minister for an excellent Budget that seeks to bring Singaporeans together.1.37 pmMr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am heartened that the 2020 Budget has been carefully calibrated to cater to the COVID-19 situation which has had an unexpected but swift and severe impact on our economy and society. This is a big, bold Budget which comes at the price of a $10.9 billion deficit, responding to the need for help by Singaporean households and businesses. This crisis has shown the importance and relevance of our Government's tradition of prudence. With an accumulated surplus of $18.7 billion over this current term of office, there remains a war chest of $7.8 billion, which is very reassuring.We should be prepared for a protracted outbreak as the situation is still evolving with growing cases reported globally. The solution does not lie in just successful containment in Singapore. It is a global effort by all countries to find a solution, as indicated by the World Health Organization.Should the COVID-19 outbreak become more prolonged and have an even greater impact on households and companies than what is currently experienced, we believe that the Government would draw upon the surplus funds to finance further measures to help.I would first like to touch on support measures. The Government's Care and Support Package will go some way to provide relief to individuals who have experienced income disruptions due to the impact of COVID-19 on businesses. The combination of cash, rebates and grocery vouchers will help households to manage their living expenses for a period of time.For Singaporeans living in 1-room and 2-room HDB flats, the $100 Groceries Vouchers provided to assist them are limited for use at participating supermarkets. May I ask whether the Ministry would consider allowing them to be used at provision shops or even markets? This will also be a way of supporting small businesses in our housing estates.I welcome the widening of qualifying criteria for the $100 cash support to citizens who earned more than $100,000 in 2019 or who live in private properties. This recognises that the COVID-19 situation is a challenge that all Singaporeans are facing and may be affected in one way or another regardless of their income level.It would be good if the Ministry would share how it arrived at the various financial assistance figures. This will help to illustrate the intended impact of the financial assistance and also, the timeliness of the payouts.Deputy Prime Minister Heng has said that the Government \"…will be prepared to do more when the situation warrants it\". Has the Ministry also set for itself some indicators internally to decide on when further assistance be rendered should the outbreak crisis deepen? In such a scenario, thecost of certain essential goods may increase as disruptions in supply chains may create shortages in supply. Singaporeans may then suffer the double whammy of lower or even loss of income, and a highercost of living.Under the Jobs Support Scheme, employers will receive the 8% cash grant on the wages of local employees for the months of October to December 2019. What about businesses that started operating this year which are also affected by COVID-19? Would the Government consider helping them as well? In addition, may I request for the grants to be given out earlier, especially for smaller businesses which operate on tight cashflows and are already severely impacted?I would like to urge the Minister to review if the current reliefs are sufficient to prevent the loss of jobs, particularly in the retail and food and beverage sectors. With the decline in sales, operators will immediately look atcost cutting. Operating hours will be shortened, the number of part-timers hired will be reduced, full-time staff will be placed on part-time shifts and asked to clear their leave or take no-pay leave. In the event of a prolonged crisis, what can be done to support businesses so that job losses are kept to a minimum?Feedback from various businesses indicated that the rent rebates of one month for NEA hawker centres and markets, and half month for commercial tenants in Government-managed properties are insufficient as they expect that the situation will take at least till second half of the year before it returns to normal. It is good for the Government to elaborate on the working assumption of the time frame for these rebates. If the rebates are meant to cover serious business earnings loss for February to April, one or half month rental rebates put in this context does seem reasonable. However, businesses seek the assurance that more help would be available if the situation prolongs or deteriorates further.I would also like to request for more support to be given to companies embarking or expanding their sales via e-channels. This crisis provides the impetus to push SMEs which have been reluctant to consider this sales avenue. With the currentcost structure and labour situation, it is inevitable that e-commerce would become the norm and form an essential part of any business.Next, I would like to touch on positioning for the longer term. This Budget, like previous Budgets, have schemes to support the transformation of our local enterprises. Many of these incentives have a pre-set time period, for example, three years, or are subject to renewals or extensions. Companies change and transform at different paces, depending on the maturity of the industry and support available, especially for smaller ones. To encourage companies to plan ahead and remain continuously invested in the future, would the Government consider setting longer term horizons for selected incentives? For example, when Pioneer Tax Incentives were first introduced, longer durations, up to 15 years, were given.As we continue on the digital transformation of our economy, more support would be needed to help smaller companies adopt new technology, not only with respect to the technical aspects but also with thecosts. Perhaps tax incentives for the telecommunications or selected sectors can be provided so that they can lower the fees for the eco-system to promote adoption and switch-overs.Closer cooperation between MOM and Institutes of Higher Learning will be necessary to ensure that the SkillsFuture courses are of high quality and relevant to industry to support our economy’s transformation. The course materials, modes of instruction, quality of instructors, just to name a few, should be constantly reviewed and audited to ensure that they are up to par. The courses could also be broken down into mobile modular sections for the workers to learn on the go and achieve accreditation over time.Mr Speaker, Sir, while we are now facing an intimidating combination of challenges which include a global health concern, economic transformations and geopolitical tensions, I remain optimistic that we will be able to emerge from this victorious and become even more competitive and nimble. The trust among our people, our businesses and the Government is strong and that is the main reason for my belief. I would like to conclude with my hearty support for the Budget.1.45 pmMr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee): Mr Speaker, this is is a responsive, responsible and remarkable Budget. Responsive because it addresses an immediate crisis. Responsible because it remains fiscally sound. Remarkable because it took all of a few weeks to prepare. This is a Budget for extraordinary times. That we are facing potential global financial instability is moot. What we face is not just an invisible enemy but also the real visible damage it causes to the economy.Last Sunday, I stopped by Marina Square at about 1.20 pm between my events. I wanted to pick up some things from a maternity shop. I was somewhat apprehensive because I knew how crowded Marina Square can be at the weekends. Yet, I entered a carpark that was sparse. From the carpark to the shop, I consciously counted a total of only 38 shoppers. At one of the empty children's playgrounds in the shopping centre, I saw the counter staff staring blankly into space because there was never one shadow of a child within the space. At Jewel, outlets famous for their long queues were momentarily famous for non-existent queues. Although the crowds and confidence has returned in the last week, the damage has been done. Heartland malls have fared better a little bit better but still report lower numbers than usual. People are taking precautions. Food and grocery delivery services perhaps have benefited most from this crisis, But tourism and service sectors hit directly will take time to recover. This is also no longer a regional problem. It is not a regional illness anymore. It has global reach.A responsive expansionary Budget is a needed assurance The $5.6 billion Stabilisation and Support Package, even if adjusted for inflation, far outstrips the $230 million SARS package in 2003. This is not just for business but for Singaporean.The $1.6 billion Care and Support Package not only provides a leg up but also goes towards, hopefully, stimulating the economy through spending There are not many governments that can do this and do this quickly, and be so detailed in its response to a crisis.Yet questions remain: one, is it enough? Two, can we do more? And three, when will we do more?The MTI has downgraded the 2020 economic growth forecast, projected between -0.5% and 1.5% on the impact of COVID-19, just slightly better than Hong Kong’s projected -1.5% to 0.5%. According to the S&P Dow Jones, the S&P 500 has wiped out $2.138 trillion since last Wednesday with $1.737 trillion or 63% loss in two days of trade since the start of the week. And this is just on fear of COVID-19 impacting the Amercian economy. We need therefore to buffer ourselves against a potential recession.The two packages are significant, but how much will the needle move? How much does the Government expect the worst downside to be? Are we able and prepared to do more? Can we still as responsive as we are currently? People are worried for their livelihoods. They have taken to heart with what this Budget has provided. But it may take more than care, support and stabilisation to shore up, if this drags on.During the Ministerial Statement on COVID-19, I asked if more can be done quicker. I am heartened by the Budget announcements but urge more haste and more heart for those who are affected. And I hope Deputy Prime Minister can provide further reassurance on this.While we need to be responsive, we also need to be responsible. We expect to run an overall Budget deficit of $10.95 billion. This is about 2.1% of our GDP. Yet our fiscal prudence means we will not be drawing on past reserves. This is a hallmark of stability and a responsible Government. There are not many governments that can do this. We only need to look around us and observe how things can go wrong. Getting our politics right is key. Looking north in the last few days, we are lucky to be spared the intrigue and drama in our system. Perhaps we should be thankful to the late Tengku Abdul Rahman that we are no longer party to this. We wish our northern neighbour well but we also wish that such distractions may never plague us.In fact, despite the major interruption posed by COVID-19, we have not allowed ourselves to be distracted.While responding to the crisis decisively, this Government has also not shifted focus With an eye on the future, SkillsFuture prepares us as a people for future challenges, gives us both the resource and also encourages personal responsibility. However, we also need to be mindful of how we implement the schemes. I heard feedback from SkillsFuture WSQ course providers of the challenges they face in claims, especially when participants do not complete or fail their course. Many end up not being able to pay and providers cannot claim. Some providers have also been told that if a trainee does not complete, they should factor the trainees as part of attrition or bad debts to be written off. We are all in this together. Honest course providers commit resources to develop and maintain these courses, and hope to be reimbursed in a timely manner. I hope that while we care for our workers and help them upgrade that course providers, been mostly SMEs, are also aptly protected for playing their part and not to be left with a recourse or assistance.Beyond the short to mid term, the Budget also looks far ahead to an existential threat brought about by global warming. The problem is not immediate, but committing an initial $5 billion to Coastal Protection does show our commitment.Mr Speaker, being responsible also means telling the hard truth, even if sometimes unpalatable. Yesterday, it was said in this House that, \"If you have nothing good to say, then best to keep quiet.\" That is easy, Mr Speaker, is the easy thing to do. It is easy to only say nice things. It is easy not to have to make hard decisions. It is easy to be popular and likeable. But being a good and effective leader is not easy. The difficult task is to tell it like it is. The difficult task is sacrificing personal standing to say the needful. And the difficult task is calling out bad behaviour when required.This Government knows that hard truths hurt but does not shy away from it. Without these hard truths and hard decisions, Singapore would not be where it is today. That to me is the mark of true leadership and wisdom. When someone takes his or her duty seriously to make hard decisions, that is true responsibility.Credit is due to the Deputy Prime Minister and the MOF team as well as the other Ministries for being able to respond to this crisis so rapidly. This Budget would have been a long process but to turn it around in face of a crisis takes mettle. It is therefore remarkable because it is responsive. It is also remarkable because it remains responsible. A government that can respond to trouble and not fall to the temptation of being populist in the process, all this because we also have a remarkable people and a remarkable country.Our common response to COVID-19 is mirrored in the Budget. When DORSCON Orange was declared, many banded together to do something for the community. We have heard many examples over the course of the many speeches in this House. My own volunteers in my constituency asked what we could do to encourage our frontline heroes. In three days, we managed to pull together a programme which we called \"Cookies for SG Heroes\". We started off wanting to bake cookies and progressed to preparing care packs for the staff of Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. Within hours of putting the word out, the Girl Guides responded donating their famous biscuit tins, Hock Hua Tonic responded offering their herbal tea atcost, the Singapore Kindness Movement responded providing encouragement decals, Gain City came on board offering the use of their show kitchens, residents, Singaporeans responded. By the morning we had so much that we needed bigger bags to pack the care bags. A total of 136 residents came together and we baked close to 11,000 cookies that day. The feeling was moving. One of our baking coordinators Pey Yng was interviewed for a video. She had moved out of our constituency a few years earlier but responded immediately when we asked for help. When asked why she wanted to help and stepped forward, she said, almost tearing, \"Instead of discriminating, we should be encouraging them.\"Mr Speaker, these frontline heroes include our medical staff, allied healthcare workers, cleaners, conservancy workers, security personnel, back office staff and many many others. These are our fellow Singaporeans, our brothers and sisters. We are battling a stealthy enemy that does not discriminate. Yet a small minority do.Yesterday, a former colleague of mine shared his wife’s experience. She works in the frontline and she was helping with contact tracing and temperature taking. Yet, someone felt that even amidst the heightened alert that he was entitled to take it out on her and her colleagues. Throwing the pen at her and shouting at her colleagues. Because? Actually, there is no need for a because.Another resident confided in me sending me a Facebook message. I asked for her permission to share this with everyone. She wrote: \"Sir, I do not know why people treat us like this. Why is my uniform, which I aspired to and was inspired by others to don, now deemed as a mark of shame? Why do people stand away from me even when I am on the way to work, and not the other way round. Why do people look at me with a glint of horror? Have I committed a crime? It hurts. But I will keep doing what I love. I will keep on saving lives because many Singaporeans are not like them. And when those who shun us arrive in my hospital, I will care for them just the same as the others. With love, with respect and to the best of my ability because just like the Nurse's Pledge I took, I will uphold my integrity.”Mr Speaker, when this crisis comes to pass, when we get back to normalcy, I ask that we commit ourselves to do something meaningful to recognise our frontline workers. Let us do right by them. Give them back the dignity they deserve and in the process earn on behalf of all Singaporeans the forgiveness we all need for shunning them. We salute you, our brothers and sisters.Mr Speaker, I apologise for the lengthiness of my speech because there is a lot of good to say about this Budget. I therefore add my voice in support of this Budget.1.57 pmEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon): Mr Speaker, Sir, I congratulate our Finance Minister for presenting this very caring and heart-warming Budget which will take us through the difficult circumstances caused by COVID-19. It is like a very much needed vaccine to support our economy, especially the badly affected sectors, and also to protect jobs for our people. Having said that I would like to raise a few pointers for the Minister to consider. In Chinese, please.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Currently, many people are concerned about the impact on the economy brought about by COVID-19. Employers are worried that they are unable to carry on with their businesses. Employees are worried about their job security.I would like to thank the Government for providing a half to one month’s of rental rebate to hawker centres and Government-managed commercial tenants. If the outbreak continues, is this enough? Will the Government introduce more measures?For example, will the Government reduce the rental until the DORSCON level returns to green? JTC or HDB, for example, can take the lead to reduce rentals of their commercial tenants and office spaces. I believe this will be able to reduce the impact brought about by the outbreak.Of the $4 billion assistance, how much will be used to help SMEs? How can we make sure that landlords will share the savings with the SMEs?Besides tourism-related sectors, many other industries such as manufacturing, maritime and construction, are also affected severely due to various extra expenditures and the fact that China's manufacturing industry has come to a standstill. They asked if the foreign workers' levy could be temporarily waived.Why is everybody looking to the Government for help in times like these? The outbreak has no mercy, but there is warmth in the world. Have faith in our Government, which is a caring Government.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]I have also received feedback from several Grab and Gojek drivers who said that they are not eligible for the support package for full-time drivers, because they do not meet the minimum number of trips made due to reduced demand within that period, Will the Minister be able to take a look at this group?I would also like to urge taxi companies to consider reducing the taxi rental rates until the DORSCON level returns to green. Many taxi drivers have shared with me that their income have dipped by 50%. A reduction of the monthly taxi rental rate by 50% will help them get through this difficult period.(In English): Mr Speaker, I will now move on to climate change. Are we exploring our full potential for photovoltaic (PV) systems? A PV system employs solar modules, each comprising a number of solar cells, which generate electrical power. Are we ready to allow Town Councils to install PV panels on roofs and vertical areas such as lift shafts?A case in point is MPC@Khatib, our covered multi-purpose court that can accommodate four basketball courts. During its design, we enquired if PV panels could be installed to harvest the solar energy. As usual, I always explore ways to make Nee Soon South cleaner and greener. Unfortunately, the answer from HDB then was no. Maybe at that time, they were not ready. So, I would like to urge them to review this.Many residents welcome the SkillsFuture top up which is very useful. I urge the Government to monitor if course providers raise their prices as a response.I note there is a reduction in S Pass sub-dependency ratio ceilings (DRCs) for the Construction, Shipyards and Process sectors. It is good that the Government has a long-term view to reduce Singapore’s reliance on foreign labour. But if we do not have a pipeline of Singaporean labour for construction and shipyards, then cutting the DRCs might be an additional burden on companies. This could leave the companies no choice but to relocate out of Singapore, especially the shipyards.May I ask what are the plans to ensure that we continue to create good jobs for locals and have a steady pipeline of local PMETs for the Construction, Shipyards and Process sectors?In facing the COVID-19 difficulties, it is important to have the entire industry, that is, developers, contractors, consultants, subcontractors, suppliers and all stakeholders tackle the challenges cohesively as a whole. In the same way as how the relief measures are rolled out for the hospitality and retail sectors, the same should be done for the Property and Construction sector. This sector also holds a lot of jobs and should not be neglected.Many local contractors also told me that they feel discriminated in recent few contract awards. In the LTA Jurong Regional Line Projects, for example, four out of seven contracts were awarded to foreign contractors. Another example, LTA awarded contract N112 tender to a foreign contractor though our local contractor submitted the lowest tender. The lowest tenderer is an established home-grown contractor. Why pay $6 million more to a foreign contractor? I know there is such thing as PQM (Price Quality Method) scoring. But if there is a gap in the capabilities of our local contractors, then we should handhold them and nurture them. We need our home-grown contractors to grow, to build up their experience, their portfolio so that they can venture overseas.If we do not even support our own contractors, who will support them? Can we consistently apply the policy of Buy Singapore First?New Budget measures aimed at boosting the retirement incomes and employability of seniors are a step in the right direction, but I feel we need to understand residents need better and get the priority right. I had seen cases where residents do not have enough money to service their mortgage loan or no roof over their heads, but they have money in the retirement accounts. To many residents, having a roof is more immediate and more important need than providing for retirement. How can we help them?And I feel financial incentives alone may not be enough to encourage businesses to hire and retain older workers. This requires more in-depth study.I move on to issues that residents are facing. Noise pollution from vehicle engines is a common occurrence faced by Nee Soon South residents and I am sure in many other parts of Singapore too.If I may refer to a Swedish report published in 2009, which found people who were regularly exposed to traffic noise in excess of 50 decibels were 40% more likely to suffer a heart attack than those who lived in quieter neighbourhoods. So, the implication is besides the noise nuisance, they also create health issues and acost to society. There are technologies used in other countries. The UK use Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) tech to dish out fines to drivers over excessive noise. Calgary, a city in Canada, is using Sound Camera and fine motorists with excessively loud vehicles. Similarly, Abu Dhabi Police have invented a noise-measuring camera, which will help officers take action against abnormally loud cars. There are also intelligent speed bumps that flatten when you are driving within speed limit. Is Singapore exploring some of these new technologies? Any Budget allocated for these? And will there be more stringent action against car workshops which do illegal modification to the motorcycles and cars?Town Councils are essential in improving the environment of HDB residents. But often, Town Councils are hampered by regulations. For example, Nee Soon Town Council has been flying drones for its estate inspection but due to the regulations, our drone inspection could only be carried out during weekends. Can these regulations be relaxed? Another example, some Town Councils have been asking the HDB since Jan 2018 to allow Town Councils to procure our goods and services online. Currently, Government is on GeBIZ but Town Councils are not allowed to make use of GeBIZ for procurement.There are e-procurement platforms that we could adopt but HDB has not come back to us on our request. Can we get some timeline for this? Also, can I ask MND to consider providing additional grants to Town Councils for older flats or flats built for the silver generation for the maintenance of silver-friendly facilities such as the Alarm Alert System. Such systems and others are expensive to maintain.I am happy to hear that HIP II is being implemented. And on this note, I would like to request for flats in Nee Soon South those which were built in 1987, be among the first few batches? My residents have been waiting for the programme for a long, long time.Mr Speaker, Sir, despite the issues I have raised, I want to put my speech within the right context. I fully appreciate Deputy Prime Minister's thoughtfulness and insightfulness to swiftly get into the thick of things, given that this COVID-19 only came to attention in January. He was able to adroitly dribble his way and roll out so many measures across so many fronts. He was able to assess the impact on our economy and the ramifications globally, and work out the packages, without forgetting the packages for our seniors and for families. And while doing all these, the coronavirus was still evolving.No one knows how severe it would pan out. Even as we gather here today to debate, the virus is rearing its ugly head in many places worldwide. I think it is very fitting that we assure Deputy Prime Minister that we stand behind him and he is not alone. Perhaps my thoughts would be best expressed by quoting the lyrics from the Liverpool FC song: \"When you are walking through a storm, hold your head up high. Don't be afraid of the dark because at the end of the storm, there's a golden sky.\"Mr Speaker, I would not sing, I cannot and I do not want!Mr Speaker: Thank you very much.Er Dr Lee Bee Wah: And I do not want to empty this House. But I will say this to the Deputy Prime Minister:\"Walk on, walk onWith hope in your heartAnd you'll never walk aloneYou'll never walk alone.\"Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget. [Applause.]Mr Speaker: I was about to say that the HIP II flats should come to Kembangan-Chai Chee first, before Nee Soon. But because you quoted that song, I will let you go first. Mr Terence Ho.2.13 pmMr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member): Speaker, Sir, the arts have always played an important role in defining our nation's cultural identity in Singapore. The arts bring diverse communities together. For the arts to remain sustainable and accessible for all in Singapore, Giving plays a vital role to allow arts to live strong, develop and grow.Amid the evolving coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak, the arts community brings people together, spreads love and positivity. My colleague in Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO), the CEO of SSO, Chng Hak-Peng shared \"three reasons why the arts in general, and classical music concerts in particular are essential even during times of crisis for a modern and complex society like Singapore\", in The Straits Times on 25 February 2020.The arts is an essential part of life. As shared by Hak-Peng, firstly, it is important to maintain an environment of normalcy as life goes on. Secondly, music feeds the soul. And it re-energises, and allows audiences to breathe. Lastly, the arts help you to cope with uncertainty. Allow me to quote him in his article, \"For me, this is like building our psychological resilience. The arts help you to surrender yourself to the unknown, and the beauty of a piece of art or music reinvigorates your belief that, as human beings, we have the ability to transcend today’s problems and attain greatness.\"The current measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 have led to a number of shows and performances being cancelled or postponed. This has spurred arts groups to consider creative alternatives, such as digital performances, to bring some comfort during this trying time. Ding Yi Music Company held a very first digital concert Together We Stand, with local artistes and our Minister for Community, Youth and Sports Grace Fu sang in the finale piece. It was a touching and inspiring piece to battle COVID-19.Prime Minister Lee also shared a special music video of \"Home\", performed by the Singapore Chinese Orchestra in tribute to our healthcare and frontline workers, on both his Facebook and Instagram. In his post, he mentioned that he was glad the arts community is doing its part to rally Singaporeans during the outbreak, including National Arts Council. They produced a very interesting and inspiring video called \"#StayStrong and #DontKancheong\" video, which involved many local artists and they shared what they have been up to and what they have to say to Singapore.Other than tapping on online platforms and social media, some arts groups and individuals continue to perform and bring the audiences some encouragement and positivity. When a group of people see others appear calm and able to appreciate the arts, it reinforces a sense of peace and chill in the community. This is more positive and encouraging than seeing each other rush to buy daily necessities, like rice and toilet paper and develop a sense of panic.Just over the weekend, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO) organised two full house concerts at The Esplanade. Just last evening, two young gentlemen – Wong Qin Kai and Goh Shunta – held a recital, \"The Erhu Works\" which I had the honour of attendingl; I was there at the performance. This is the flyer. And it was almost full house, even during this trying period. I hope such examples will inspire more to come forward, to build a more caring, cohesive and confident society, together.Giving to the arts and culture has been significant in the past few years. For instance, Deputy Prime Minister Heng shared that the Government will set aside $250 million to boost efforts to partner with the community in projects, during the recent Budget announcement. This includes a $20 million that will be used to top up the Our Singapore Fund, which supports projects in the social and community domains initiated by citizens. The Fund will also be extended for five more years from this year.I am heartened by the news and I thank the Government for putting aside this sum of money to boost community partnership and efforts, to bring forth more opportunities for all and to empower the arts.Since Our Singapore Fund was announced in Budget 2016, I understand that it has committed nearly $4.3 million to more than 240 ground-up projects in areas ranging from heritage to sports. This Fund continues to help create access and opportunities to arts of different forms and engage Singaporeans of all ages. The arts build a more cohesive society and I wonder how this Fund can be further be extended to help arts and culture companies and enterprises to bring more Singaporeans together, groom and grow attendance and participation for the arts.The COVID-19 outbreak has also an impact on the worldwide economy. Economists believe that the growth of the economy has slowed down and in the case of a downturn, it would have an impact on the arts giving and sponsorship.I believe that a more targeted and well-defined Cultural Matching Fund (CMF) policy can help small, medium arts groups in Singapore to enjoy the benefits. To battle the economy downturn, I propose to review and reconsider the CMF. This could be a long-term measure, instead of a short-term or mid-term measure. Perhaps, the Ministry can consider to match not only for funds raised, but also for earned income such as the ticket proceeds. This would help many of the smaller scale arts groups with less fund-raising power to be able to tap on the matching fund. I will share more, during the Committee of Supply. Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.] Arts have always played an important role in defining Singaporeans' cultural identity. With the increasing number of artists and people involved in arts groups in Singapore and a vibrant arts sector, every Singaporean is able to enjoy the arts.The COVID-19 outbreak has sparked worldwide concern and impacted public life. With the DORSCON outbreak alert level raised to orange, many Singaporeans inevitably felt anxious. Quite a number of arts performances were also cancelled or postponed.In an attempt to uplift public spirit amidst the outbreak, local chamber music group Ding Yi Music Company held a digital concert on Valentine's Day to spread positivity to frontline healthcare workers and members of the public who are feeling uneasy. In fact, online platforms have become a channel for many arts groups which seek to be heard. National Arts Council also launched a video with the theme \"Stay Strong, Don't Kancheong\" on the 20th of February, with many local artists joining in the video to boost the morale of Singaporeans. The video has been well-received.In addition, the Singapore Chinese Orchestra produced a heartwarming music video in a tribute to healthcare workers battling the COVID-19 virus at the frontlines. The music video, featuring one of Singapore’s national songs \"Home\", was brimming with emotions. Although everybody is feeling anxious amidst the outbreak, healthcare workers braving the storm deserve special support and care from the community. The music video by SCO received a \"like\" from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who said he was glad the arts community is doing its part to rally Singaporeans to fight the outbreak, and is able to continue performing for the public by going online.The value of arts in the daily lives of Singaporeans have also been recognized. During this extraordinary period, arts groups have sought to encourage and unite the nation, as well as pay tribute to healthcare workers, through arts and music. In times of crisis, arts and culture can uplift spirits. For example, last weekend, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra performed two sold-out concerts; two young Erhu musicians Wang Qin Kai and Wu Fu Jun also performed to a full house audience last night. I personally attended this concert and I am heartened to see the huge turnout. The music does not stop, and life must go on!In the budget statement announced recently, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat shared that the government will set aside $20 million to top up the Our Singapore Fund (OSF) and extend the fund to 2025. This is to encourage Singaporeans from a wider range of domains to initiate and launch more meaningful community projects. The Government will set aside $250 million to boost efforts involving community partnerships, with $20 million earmarked for OSF top ups to encourage more ground-up community initiatives.The sustained development of arts groups is not only dependent on strong government support, but also the support of companies and foundations that identify with them, as well as the active participation, sponsorship and donation of our people. I hope that the Government will consider exercising greater flexibility and adopt a more targeted approach in the administration of the Culture Matching Fund. For example, besides providing matching funds for donations, the Government could perhaps consider providing matching funds based on proceeds from performances and ticket sales. I believe that this would help many small to medium-sized arts groups such as Siong Leng Musical Association, Nam Hwa Opera and Singapore Traditional Arts Centre, so that they can benefit from the Culture Matching Fund despite limited fundraising resources.Arts knows no boundaries in terms of age and background, everyone can enjoy the arts. Arts helps to build confidence, enhance one’s image and attractiveness. Looking ahead, I hope that culture and the arts will continue to bring diverse communities together and contribute to a more cohesive society.(In English): I am in support of Budget 2020.Mr Speaker: Mr Mohamad Irshad.2.25 pmMr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member): Mr Speaker, allow me to begin with a moment of self-reflection.Mr Speaker: Sorry. My apologies. Mr Vikram Nair.Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang): Sorry to interrupt the self-reflection. Mr Speaker, I rise in support of this Budget. A government has many competing needs for expenditure and it is always a difficult exercise to allocate scarce resources to these competing needs. Singapore has, for many years faced structural challenges that each Budget has had to address, including an ageing population, ever increasing demands for social spending, particularly in healthcare and a risk of falling revenues as the workforce shrinks.This year, we had an added spanner thrown into the works as the COVID-19 virus threatening lives, but which has also had a withering impact on our economy. Against this backdrop, this Budget does an excellent job of both addressing our short-term needs in relation to cushioning the economic impact of COVID-19 while continuing to invest in our people and meeting our country's long-term structural needs.I will focus on the implications of COVID-19 for us in this speech, as I believe it is an important area in which the Government can send the right signals and messages, but ultimately, the entire population needs to come together with the right mindset to weather the storm.The situation in relation to COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Singapore has dealt with pandemics before in recent memory. This includes the SARS outbreak in 2002 and the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. COVID-19 appears to be less deadly than SARS, but more infectious but less infectious than H1N1. And while it has killed many people in Wuhan and China, the overall death rate appears to go down as more cases are diagnosed and we have evidence of more people making recoveries.Singapore had taken very firm measures to try and contain this, led by the 4G team of leaders, and its efforts have won praise from many quarters. We had to develop a strategy for dealing with the virus in very short order, including developing protocols for confining those at risk, treating those who were diagnosed and, at the same time, trying to keep the economy going.Businesses were encouraged to test out Business Continuity Plans and many businesses are now experimenting with teams working remotely, and this includes banks, financial institutions, law firms, including mine and even the Courts. I have to admit, I was a little sceptical at first about the need for trying out such plans, but having tried the working from home, I have actually found it is quite workable and, in some respects, even more productive as you have less distractions and do not have to spend so much time travelling to and from the office. All in all, I think we can come out stronger.However, this does not detract from the very real harm that COVID-19 has done to many sectors of the economy. Air travel and tourism, in particular, has been very badly hit. Changi Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world, has been relatively quiet, including the Jewel, where I understand you can now get an A&W meal without much queuing. F&B places are not getting their usual crowds, particularly those in town and employers and workers in these sectors are clearly worried.In this respect, I think the Government's measures to assist businesses are timely and send the right message. Rental is a big concern for many businesses and the provision of rental rebates as well as property tax rebates to property owners send a strong message that the Government is helping to buffer some of this pain. I am also heartened that many of the bigger landlords have also taken the cue and have confirmed they will be passing on these rebates on to their tenants. The Wage Support Scheme helps to cushion employers from wagecosts, and I hope they take the message to try and keep their employees as long as possible. Ultimately, I hope we can come through this episode building stronger relationships with each other, whether it is with landlord, employee or customer and do not just see these relationships as transactional ones.The Budget sends the right signal, but we need everyone to work together to make it work. Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will speak in Tamil.(In Tamil):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.] COVID-19 has created slowdowns throughout the economy. Food and beverage, retail, transport and events related businesses are all suffering. Workers in these businesses also face uncertainty.This Budget plays an important role in helping businesses and workers tide through this difficult period. It is important though for us to look out for one another during this time. For property owners getting tax rebates, please pass this down to your tenants. For businesses that get rental rebates and wage support, please keep your workers. If business is down, this will be a good time to go for training.For older workers, please use the additional SkillsFuture grants wisely, and go for training that may help you pick up the skills that will be helpful at work or to transition to new work. The Government can create opportunities, but you need to come forward and use them.It is my hope that we will come out of this adverse time stronger than before, like we have done during our previous challenges in 2008 during the global financial crisis and in 2002 with SARS.(In English): In Singapore, we have had some good news over the last week. While in the early days, we were getting more and more news of people infected and some in critical condition, now we get more news of people being discharged. According to a CNA report yesterday, we now have 58 cases of people who have made full recovery. Of the 33 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving although seven remain in critical condition and in intensive care.However, COVID-19 is now spreading rapidly outside our borders. Cases are now emerging all around the world, including in Europe, South America, Middle East and the USA. China’s economy has already been hit hard by the virus, with its growth forecast revised down to 4.5% in the last quarter, the lowest since the Global Financial Crisis.If this becomes a global pandemic and different countries take different measures, the economic impact could have longer term implications for Singapore. As it is, the drop in business from China has hurt our economy and many others in the world as China is the world’s second largest economy. If other countries start closing borders or restricting business activities in response, there could be serious economic repercussions. If large numbers of businesses fail or close during this period, the implications on growth could be significant and Singapore will not be cushioned.In this respect, I think it will be important for our companies to be braced and prepared for the implications of significant disruptions in global trade and supply chains. In the short term, for companies that need to pay wages, bills and rentals on a monthly basis may appear existential, but in the long term, most analysts believe this will be a bump on the road. For workers who may lose their job during this period, please understand it is a difficult economy, but please make use of the wide range of measures available, including the SkillsFuture top-ups to retrain and try and pick up new skills. I believe if we ride the storm together, we can come out stronger. And this Budget is a big help in that process.Mr Speaker: Mr Mohamed Irshad.2.34 pmMr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member): Mr Speaker, allow me to begin with a moment of self-reflection. Over the current term of Government, this House has accumulated a Budget surplus of over $17.4 billion. In the preceding years, many Singaporeans have expressed concerns over the size of this surplus. They have always wondered whether we could invest more in our people. Sir, Budget 2020, partly influenced by COVID-19, provides a timely answer to this perennial question.Mr Speaker, I will be focusing on three areas from this year's Budget. First, our ability to quickly respond to crisis; second, creating a future-ready city; and third, continued investments in our fellow Singaporeans.Sir, I begin by speaking about our nation's ability to quickly respond to crisis. As Members are aware, COVID-19 spread like a wildfire. Without doubt, COVID-19 is one of the biggest crises Singapore has faced in over a decade. As the impact of COVID-19 continues to unfold, Budget 2020 addresses several of our immediate macro-economic concerns and with such a forward-looking budget, I am confident that together we will overcome this crisis and emerge stronger.However, Mr Speaker, in my conversations with our fellow Singaporeans, many have expressed the views that the crisis management aspect of the Budget will only last a few months. Sir, I understand their concerns. Those of us who experienced SARS keenly remember its impact. Given the uncertainty behind the long-term progression of COVID-19, I wish to ask the hon Minister what further measures can we expect in a Supplementary Budget.In the event that the war against the virus becomes protracted, how will this House respond? I am sure that a positive response will allay the anxieties of many.Next, I wish to speak about the individuals fighting on the frontlines. As we continue to manage the outbreak, we are witnessing many companies tightening their belt. Reports of companies freezing staff salaries, implementing pay and bonus cuts are increasingly surfacing in the media.To my understanding, our healthcare system is not immune to these financial pressures. Our hospitals have understandably been forced to shelve their revenue-generating cases to deal with this outbreak. It is understood that this decrease in revenue will have an impact on the bonuses that our healthcare workers will receive.Sir, given the extraordinary circumstances, I hope the Finance Minister will consider extending financial support or even bonuses to our nurses and doctors who are in the frontlines. In this regard, I echo the suggestions made by Member Murali Pillai yesterday. Ultimately, Sir, they not only had to work longer hours, but literally put their lives on the line.Sir, I turn to focus on our economy as a whole. I am keenly aware of the Government’s announcement that GST will remain at 7% for 2021; and the $6 billion dollar Assurance Package for Singaporeans to cushion the projected increase in GST.While I understand that we cannot put off the increase indefinitely, can the Minister give an indication of when the eventual hike will be implemented? Additionally, would the Minister consider increasing GST in stages; from 7% to 8% and eventually from 8% to 9%.Lastly, turning away from GST, I also note that Deputy Prime Minister has announced a Corporate Income Tax Rebate of 25% for 2020. In view of the economic crunch that we are facing, I wonder if the Government would consider granting a similar tax rebate for Personal Income Tax to help Singaporean with their cashflow.Sir let me close this segment on our response to COVID-19. The rationale behind our Budget surplus has always been twofold. First, to ensure that Singapore has room to maneuver in times of crisis; second, to ensure that future generations can have a share in the fruits of our growth.We are facing a clear and present crisis with COVID-19. It is imperative that we do not lose sight of the big picture, avoid knee-jerk reactions, and respond swiftly for the well-being of fellow Singaporeans.Next, I turn to speak about creating a future-ready Singapore. As the COVID-19 crisis shows us, Mr Speaker, our nation's success is not something which occurred in a vacuum. We are successful because we have continually planned ahead. Given our time constraints, I will focus on our national efforts in preparing for climate change. Today, I aim to spark a deeper conversation about whether Singapore has the infrastructure to survive.I begin by speaking about our nation’s food resilience. In particular, I will speak on our investments in future technologies.Sir, it is fair to say that the changing climate will have a serious impact on our food supply. The rising temperatures and concurrent decline in global fish stocks are an existential threat to Singapore. I remind this House that over 90% of the food consumed in Singapore is imported.In this vein, Singapore must ensure that we are food resilient. As the recent panic buying episode reminds us, we have the capacity to withstand sudden shocks in our supply chain. However, what happens if we face a long-term disruption?Mr Speaker, I note that the Government has announced that MEWR will adopt a \"row Local\" strategy. The Budget commits to setting aside a portion of the $300 million under the Startup SG Equity in supporting agri-food related deep-tech start-ups. I support these measures. However, I have three questions.First, what success did previous programmes aiming to encourage the production of local produce have? If those successes were limited, what changes are we making to ensure that our \"Grow Local\" strategy will be successful?Second, do we have a local pool of agri-tech start-ups which will benefit from the increasing funding set aside for them?And third, does the Government intend to support and encourage deeper integration of research and development processes between business and our tertiary education institutions in this regard? If so, what funds are being allocated to this in order to catalyse the process?Sir, the point of these questions is simple. As we continue to invest in creating a food resilient Singapore, simply setting money aside is insufficient. We must create an innovative eco-system with positive feedback loops. It is my vision for future generations of Singaporeans to be able to consume local produce daily.Looking closer to our immediate future, Sir, I speak about our transition to electric vehicles. First, I state for the record my support for our efforts in encouraging cleaner modes of transport. After years of investment, the electric future is almost upon us.However, I have some concerns about the overall impact of the scheme. I raise them in the form of questions for the Minister to address.First, 95% of our electricity is generated from natural gas. Insofar as we do not transition toward cleaner sources of electricity generation, what will be the impact of incentivising electric vehicles be? Are there any proportionate investments being made in transforming our energy mix?Second, it is not disputed that public transport is more efficient and less polluting as compared to personal vehicles. A perennial problem preventing greater utilisation of public transport is \"first mile and last mile\" connectivity issues. In this regard, does the Government intend to accelerate our investment in our park connector networks to ensure greater access to public transport hubs and to encourage alternative modes of transport via cycling?Lastly, as we even transition toward electric vehicles, how can we ensure that even less pollutive technology such as hydrogen fuel cells, are not locked out of the market?Ultimately, I submit that simply transitioning to electric vehicles is not enough. If we want to have a significant impact, we must be prepared to think boldly. We must transform our mindsets. We must transform our infrastructure. We must take the lead in moving toward a fossil fuel free future in our region.Thus, over the next few years, I hope that this House will seriously consider adopting alternative power sources including nuclear energy given the advances in technology and to look beyond electric vehicles.Sir, I move to the final segment of my speech. Mr Speaker, one thing which unites all Members of this House, is our desire to serve fellow Singaporeans. In this final segment, I will focus on how we can continue to invest in our fellow citizens.In this segment, I will first address our SkillsFuture programme. Following that, I will speak about how we can further invest in our fellow Singaporeans.In order to succeed, our people must be adaptable to changes. They should be able to ride the structural waves that are disrupting the world. Our aims of becoming a global node of innovation and enterprise will materialise when we can ensure that our Singaporeans who are locally trained are globally framed.On to SkillsFuture, Mr Speaker, I welcome the Government’s proposal to top-up the individual SkillsFuture funds. This sends a strong signal about our priorities. However, beyond topping up our SkillsFuture funds, I raise the following questions for the Minister to consider.Although we have done well to promote the ethos of lifelong learning in Singapore and with Singaporeans' take-up rate of SkillsFuture being at 49% in 2019, how can we incentivise more of our workers to upgrade themselves?Second, and related to the first point, I am concerned that the current SkillsFuture programme does not maximise the potential of all Singaporeans. I note that Budget 2020 does not provide any SkillsFuture top-ups for workers aged over 60. Given our increasing longevity, I wonder if the hon Minister can extend the additional top-up to those aged over 60.In this regard, Sir, I have two potential solutions which this House can consider moving forward. The first involves tapping on existing expertise of our local SMEs. The second will require us to leverage upon existing technologies.Firstly, I propose creating a framework for a Structured Apprenticeship Programme as implemented in the UK and Germany. In this programme, students will undergo apprenticeships which will eventually culminate in a full bachelor's degree or industry recognised standards or qualifications. All these while earning a real wage and being trained in the skills employers want.Sir, this idea is not without precedent. We currently have the ITE Traineeship programme. This is an apprenticeship programme that benefits both employers and employees where students can work towards their ITE qualification while gaining practical experience. In SUSS and SMU, part-time degree programmes are also available to individuals who wish to work and study.Sir, a natural progression would be to tap on these existing frameworks and expand the work-study offerings in our system. I am confident that our SkillsFuture programmes will see higher participation rates if we are able to provide practical pathways to success.More than a specific programme, Sir, I suggest that we leverage upon existing technologies to enhance our SkillsFuture experience. Currently, our SkillsFuture programmes exclude workers with little control over their schedule, such as shift workers. Singapore is poorer for the fact that a segment of our population cannot upskill themselves adequately.Sir, I wonder if the adoption of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), or similar e-learning technologies, may be a potential solution to this issue. Over the last two years, our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have seamlessly transitioned to e-learning following the COVID-19 situation.Thus far, many lessons and tutorials have gone online. For instance, in our local Universities, even group work and presentations are being held virtually. This move clearly shows that the required infrastructure, platforms and systems are well in place.Indeed, there are many models available for Public Service to consider. Such a synergy has the potential to lay the foundation for a public, open university that offers alternative structured higher education pathway for those seeking to upgrade themselves for their career progression.At the end of the day, Sir, I hope that SkillsFuture will be made more accessible for our fellow Singaporeans. We should enable them to upskill, no matter the circumstance.My last point on investing in our fellow Singaporeans, Mr Speaker, can be summarised with this phrase \"Locally Trained and Globally Framed\". Since our separation from Malaysia, we have always recognised that Singapore cannot be insular in our economic approach. We have invested heavily in ensuring that we are an attractive place to do business.However, as the current crisis demonstrates, it is not enough that we create jobs in Singapore. Sir, I believe that our nation’s long-term economic survival depends on Singaporeans being able to compete overseas.This is where the phrase \"Locally Trained and Globally Framed\" comes in. We need to ensure that our Students acquire the cross-cultural skills and deep international understanding which would enable them to compete with the best in the world. I am heartened that Budget 2020 sets a target for 70-70 exposure in our IHL students. In this regard, the New Colombo Plan initiative by the Australian Government is a model worth studying.Sir, we must prepare our young people to succeed in the new economy. They must be relational. They must possess an international outlook and must hold their own in this ever-changing world.In conclusion, Mr Speaker, a hallmark of Singapore’s Budgets is that in good times, we are prudent and sensible. In tough times, we demonstrate our mettle and sensitivity. Budget 2020 is a clear and unambiguous reflection of the latter.In this time of crisis, Budget 2020 provides some much-needed stability. However, we must always look towards the future by making long-term investments in our infrastructure and our people to ensure Singapore is staged for success. On this note, Mr Speaker, I state my support for Budget 2020.Mr Speaker: Mr Leon Perera.2.50 pmMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member): Mr Speaker, Sir, in 2019, we were considered by the World Economic Forum (WEF) to be the country closest to the frontier of competitiveness in the world. However, instead of giving in to the temptation to vaingloriously bask in such rankings, we looked critically at the report on real shortcomings so we can reflect on them. The WEF report highlighted room for improvement in respect of promoting entrepreneurship and improving the skills base, for example.Sir, I should therefore focus my speech on three aspects of national life that pertain to the longer term outlook that we face – vibrancy, meaning the quality of the economy; livability and the well-being of the people and sustainability of our fiscal resources – before concluding with some directional suggestions that attempt to speak to the challenges we face across all these three dimensions.Before I begin, I declare my interest as a CEO of a research consultancy that undertakes work in a variety of business arenas including industry 4.0 spaces.Firstly, on vibrancy. Mr Speaker, Sir, on the back pages of The Economist magazine, they track economic indicators of various countries. Decades ago, Singapore's GDP growth was consistently among the highest in the region and the world. In recent years, it has been more modest but still better than or the same as other developed countries in this region. In 2019, however, our GDP growth was low against even developed Asian economies like Korea, Taiwan and Australia, let alone the US, and this was before the coronavirus. The Government's forecast for 2020 is roughly the same rate of growth.Sir, while we face the short-term challenges of dealing with COVIC-19, in the mid-term, our economy faces deeper structural challenges.Firstly, our economy is now heavily dependent on China which was experiencing a growth slowdown even before the coronavirus.Second, our productivity performance goes up and down but it is also bifurcated between high productivity, manufacturing and other externally oriented sectors and some less productive sectors, and between an MNC sector with higher productivity and an SME sector that employs two-thirds of our workers with less.Thirdly, our SMEs and particularly micro businesses will face headwinds, not only from the coronavirus, but also the more general China's slowdown. In fact, it is argued in a recent letter in the media from the Chairman of Credit Counselling Singapore, many micro businesses may become ensnared in a cycle of chronic indebtedness as a result of the economic impact from the coronavirus episode, as happened with SARS in 2003.Fourth, while the GDP share of R&D is decent, it is not as high as in some developed countries, and there is some evidence that R&D GDP share is linked to Total Factor Productivity. More importantly, beyond the MNC sector, it is not at all clear if R&D is being taken up and commercialised successfully on a substantial scale by our local companies, notwithstanding some take-up of licences from A*STAR by local enterprises, for example.Fifth, we continue to be successful in attracting foreign direct investment or FDI. But we have all come to acknowledge that future FDI inflows may be under threat from anti-globalisation trends that my party Chairman Ms Sylvia Lim spoke about yesterday. In particular, the deliberate efforts some countries may take to pull back supply chains to their domestic economies in light of things like the coronavirus and US-China geopolitical tensions. To insulate against this risk, we face the challenge of raising the game of our local firms.Sixth, with the rise of uniquely disruptive technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things and drones, whole categories of employment may be wiped out practically overnight. The advent of autonomous vehicles may put at risk the jobs of drivers in the taxi and private car hire industry. Many jobs in back-end operations and front-end services are also at risk from AI, robots and chatbots.So, one additional challenge is to ensure that our people can keep their heads above tomorrow's rising waters of employability amidst the sea of economic disruption not seen in generations, not only in respect of skill sets like Deep Tech and coding but also soft skills like creativity, leadership, entrepreneurial acumen and resilience. In fact, the authors of the WEF report cited room for improvement for Singapore in skills like critical thinking.Sir, how do we meet the challenge of enhancing our vibrancy, which implies stimulating homegrown innovation and entrepreneurship?The next broad point I will speak on is livability. A blind chase for vibrancy of an economy is no full guarantee of the well-being of its citizens. Putting effort into livability, therefore, is one of the most crucial challenges facing Singapore. What else can be done to breed confidence that our system will manage livability in the future?Our total fertility rate has been one of the lowest in the world for years. Twenty-nine percent of young Singaporeans in a recent survey said that they would consider migrating in the next five years. I suspect that getting livability right would make a difference on these fronts.The approach to managing thecost of living is a case in point. Why not develop an approach to policy-making that commits the state to adjust for future conditions by building the adjustment mechanism into policy design, rather than leaving it to future acts of Executive discretion, which may or may not happen? Right now, this is done in some cases like permanent GST Vouchers but not in others.One example of this would be adjusting Silver Support for inflation from time to time based on policy design rather than leaving it up to the Government and Parliament at its discretion. Parliament can still vote against inflation-based increases should fiscal resources be insufficient. So, the mechanism can still contain an element of evaluation. But the fact that the design of the policy has a built-in mechanism to recommend changes and adjust based on inflation at certain defined time intervals create some assurance that, yes, society will not leave me stranded in the future one day. This is not just a benefit for today leaving me uncertain about tomorrow.This is a very specific example to make the general point that if more well thought through social protections and stabilisers are built into policy design, it may assure Singaporeans that the society has their back. And this may reduce risk adversity and the focus on short-term income rather than long-term income. This in turn may promote a culture of being more willing to take risks to re-skill, to start a business and possibly even to have children because one is more confident about the future.Some research suggests that our economic outlook and our sense of economic security does impact these behaviours. And if we fail to address the challenge of livability like parts of the US and England, our people may turn against globalisation which would damage prospects for vibrancy.Let me note in passing, one could respond to this point by saying that this is a call for profligate spending because it requires spending commitments before we know we have the money to fund it. It is not. It is a call for building into policy design mechanisms that self-correct and have built-in adjustment processes rather than leaving it purely to future Executive discretion. The Executive and Parliament can still decide not to go ahead if the money is not there.Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to talk about sustainability. Vibrancy and livability already difficult challenges in themselves but we must ensure that policies aimed to address these challenges are sustainable and are responsible. To be sure, it is a good thing that we have large reserves that yield net investment returns or NIR, the largest state revenue stream today and that can be drawn down in emergencies. Many countries do not have this and have high levels of fiscal debt relative to GDP.But are there not also dangers in going to the other extreme and being too prudent as it were? Could that also lead to a failure to seize opportunities to develop the capacities of our people for the future?Clearly, we have to find the Goldilocks zone between these two extremes. An analogy from the business world might be the two extremes of spending too much and running into a cash crunch on the one hand and not investing enough in the company to develop the capabilities of the employees, new business strategies and intellectual property on the other.Sir, our reserves have been estimated at over a trillion dollars. Every year, these reserves grow from half of the net investment returns as well as from land sales and any unspent surplus from each term of government, among other things.I am not suggesting drawing down on the reserves at this point. But in the longer term, is there more scope to slow the rate of reserves growth, so as to release more funds to invest in our people and address the challenges we face in terms of livability, employability, innovation and so on that I spoke about in the first part of my speech?Let us bear in mind that during the worst global economic crisis the world had ever seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s, during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, we drew down only a tiny fraction of the reserves. Should our reserves always go up and up at the same rate? Can we not have reasonable conversations about how to vary the slope of reserves growth while agreeing that the principal should only be drawn down in an emergency? Andhow, in doing that, we can invest in our people and our companies so as to help them become the most creative, the most resilient, the most innovative, and the most entrepreneurial that they can possibly be so that they can deal with any challenges the world can throw at us with confidence?If we do use more fiscal resources to do that, we should also recognise that if our efforts are successful, we may be able to save and social safety net spending further downstream and we may also raise GDP and hence tax revenue which are good fiscal outcomes. My analogy here would be spending more to make vaccines free or close to free–a subject that I have raised few times in this House–which may have the effect of reducing state spending on hospital subsidies, MediFund and so on further downstream. And this is just an analogy.Mr Speaker, Sir, the three dimensions of national life I mentioned, are very much interconnected. However, as formidable as the challenges are, they are not insurmountable if we tackle them earnestly. Therefore, I would like to conclude with just a few directional suggestions on how we might address these future challenges from where we are at, at this point in time.Firstly, investing more in local enterprises that can deliver. This was how the Japanese built up their world-beating giant firms–the Japanese and Koreans I should say. For those local firms which can consistently deliver financial and economic growth while safeguarding or growing domestic jobs to those firms that significantly enhance our economic vibrancy, more support could be provided beyond the caps and limits associated with current economic schemes.I had an exchange on the subject in this House with the then Minister for Ministry of Trade and Industry, Mr Iswaran in 2017. I understand his counter argument that we do not want to go too far down the path of picking winners. There is a grain of truth there. But some of our existing efforts like state-backed co-investment, for example, could be seen as picking winners anyway. And why not let the winners pick themselves?This was the philosophy of Korea in the 1960s and 1970s, where the state insured provision of loans to chaebols on large firms, which could consistently grow exports and hard currency earnings and loan support was withdrawn from those that could not consistently deliver those results. While to be sure not everything Korea did in those decades was correct in hindsight, that policy contributed to the emergence of giant companies like Samsung and LG today. Conversely, supports to local firms that do not demonstrate ambition and performance can be disciplined and focused on competitiveness improvement, job safeguarding and business succession planning.Sir, this is a call for strategic results-based spending to develop local entrepreneurs in ways that benefit domestic employment. This is not a call to give away state monies to local firms irrespective of outcomes, and I trust that it will not be referred to as the latter.Secondly, Sir, we know that productivity is partly a function of investment and we cannot depend only on FDI for this investment in the long term. Can we not do more to tap on our fiscal resources to channel substantial R&D investment into creating IP that is then seated to local companies in a very substantial and systematic way, but with the IP owned by the state and licensed to the firm's so that the state can nudge these firms to grow in ways that benefit the domestic economy and locals?The area's earmarked for R&D investment in this way could be targeted so as to fill gaps in the global IP landscape in future-ready fields like AI so as to ensure maximum \"commercialisability\", so to speak. I know that there are limits to how much we can do under WTO rules and other treaty obligations, but surely there are ways to navigate these obstacles to some degree. And, as I referred to earlier, A*STAR has licensed IP to SMES, but the question I am raising here is how to upscale this to enhance the commercial impact and provide enablers to ambitious local firms to become world-beating.Thirdly, many of our talented youth go into the Civil Service. Twenty-six percent of Autonomous University graduates go into the public service as their first job, according to a Parliamentary answer given in 2018. Can we create a programme that mentors and coaches civil servants in their 30s, 40s or 50s, who wish to leave the service to become entrepreneurs? Such a programme could help them develop skill sets relating to fund-raising, employee recruitment and retention, marketing and so on. Not so much training, but coaching and pointing them in the right direction as well as connecting them with funding sources including state back ones. After all, we do not only want locals to get the $7,000 jobs and the $10,000 jobs. We also want some locals to create such jobs.Fourthly, can we undertake a project to map out the categories of jobs at risk from Industry 4.0 and then initiate a programme to inform workers in these sectors of the imminent risks over the mid and long term and nudge them to engage in re-skilling and career switches to high growth disruptive industries. Perhaps an incentive scheme could be deployed to attract local workers into Industry 4.0 sectors, like renewable energy, drones, AI and deep tech, especially those sectors where the Singaporean Core is weak. Having a pool of workers with such training could also help attract both foreign and domestic investment in these high growth sectors. Of course, any such move has to be done in tandem with the growth of investment in these sectors to ensure the jobs and career paths are available to those who join such industries.Lastly, as part of the Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review (SPOR), can we adopt independent measures that regularly track the capacities of our people versus other countries in terms of attributes, like resilience, entrepreneurship and creativity? Beyond just hard skills and cognitive intelligence, it is these capacities that we need to nurture in the long term. It is these capacities that will be our surest defence against whatever economic and technology evolutions bring; and tracking them in the SPOR report is a nod to the fact that our policies do play some role, not the main role, or the only role to be sure, but some role, in nurturing these capabilities and capacities among our people.Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the future is always uncertain but there are some epochs in history where it is more uncertain than average and we are probably living through one of these. We are dealing with huge geopolitical shifts, massive economic disruption, changing demographics, the existential threat of climate change and the possibility of Black Swan events like disease pandemics.But uncertainty is never a reason not to make projections and not to make both plans times of change and crisis are also moments for the agile the resilient and the creative to find new opportunities, anticipating and adapting to those moments in history like our own that see non-linear change can bring immense benefits not only in economic terms.3.09 pmMiss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan): Mr Speaker, by now it is no surprise to hear many saying that Budget 2020 is a timely relief for workers and some specific business sectors impacted by COVID-19. It also addresses short-term inadequacies while setting out plans for our strategic long term. I am thus encouraged by this Budget and glad the Government has prioritised assistance for different groups of citizens across our society.Over the years, we have seen significant financial packages announced to address long-term healthcare needs for our ageing population, GST offsets for the lower income groups, housing support, education subsidies to level the playing field for improved social equality and much more. These packages seek to enhance social mobility, provide care for those more in need and promote greater wealth distribution across society. Without doubt, these packages which have a long tail, will have a hefty price tag as they cater for increasingly larger groups of Singaporeans.In this regard, I wholeheartedly agree that the responsibility of the Government is to provide for those who have less resources and less able to sustain their daily needs. But thecost of living has been a perennial concern amongst Singaporeans, and even more so as we age. How can we better address this in current uncertain times?Are the financial packages that we see now an indicator of the Government on what is to come in future? Are we moving towards more of a welfare state? And to what extent can the society safety net provide if self-sufficiency from family and personal means remain as the first line of support in our country? This is a topic that I think we should begin to consider – retirement adequacy.In 2017, MoneySense commissioned a Financial Planning Attitudes Survey that showed only one in five surveyed felt they are knowledgeable about investing. Some Singaporeans also had misconceptions about when to start planning for their finances. Half of the young working adults aged between 17 and 29 have not started thinking about financial planning because they think it is still too early to do so. And just 20% of those surveyed felt the need to do financial planning only when they are looking at retirement. Whether the number of survey respondents were in the thousands or less, this is reflective of a worrying trend and the existing mindset of the young working class.It is totally understandable that our current Pioneers and some Merdekas will need all the support that can be given as they earn lower wages in their lifetime and thus limited savings, much less a decent CPF savings to depend upon. But this cannot be the case for the younger generation. Today, most seniors rely on their CPF, housing, personal savings and some income from work if they are still gainfully employed or if their children are willing or able to provide for them. However, we need to recognise that this landscape is changing for the middle-aged individuals.First, family sizes have shrunk with each family having at most one to two children. Parents are naturally more indulgent in their expenditures for every child. From enrichment classes, tuition, gifts, holidays and more; it is impossible to imagine any parent will give less to their offspring even if they do not compare with others in society. Through growing affluence, changing lifestyles and personal aspirations, it is par for the course today that each family have more expenses outlay over time. While general income level has risen and theoretically should be more for dual income families, it appears that meeting immediate financial needs are already a problem for some.To plan for retirement which may be two to three decades down the road, may be a tall order for many of them. For some, the necessity to plan is just before they are about to enter retirement or have less certainty in being employed. The issue will be further exacerbated with fewer children in each family and for those whose children may be able to, but are less willing to provide financially for their parents.Second, an increasing proportion of our younger generation are gaining overseas exposures at study or work and some are involved in the gig economy. For their benefit, we encourage more to internationalise, to learn and capture broader experiences and opportunities globally. But with rising percentage of such families living overseas, their retirement support pillars will inevitably change. For those living and working overseas early in their career, they may not have invested in housing within Singapore and the CPF contributions differ depending on their compensation package or the nature of their work. When they choose to return to Singapore in the later years, thecost of building their retirement nest will take a different starting point. By then, some may face different challenges in their ability to accumulate sufficiently for their retirement.On one hand, I support and feel it is necessary for the country to continue to provide for its citizens. But on the other hand, I think it is time for us to consider if and how we can continue to afford these long term, larger support packages for every generation. As working and income pattern changes, increased exposure of living or working in more than just the home country before retirement, and investments in the next generation burgeoning for each family, I cannot help but ask if our citizens should plan their financial and retirement needs more holistically and earlier.Sir, I would advocate that, as a nation, we should begin this awareness on financial retirement planning when each worker still has an active income and as they begin different stages of their life-cycle decisions. This has consequences on how and when we provide subsidies for those who cannot afford or those who are more vulnerable. How can we measure who qualifies or not for any scheme? That may need re-definition in future. Simply means testing by per capita income for each household may see the need for a different yardstick, or how intrusive would it be for the state to assess deeper on their situation beyond funds availability or even immediate family support. These are areas worth pondering and better sooner than later.On this issue of retirement adequacy, I would also like to draw attention to the group of special needs individuals. There is a large spectrum of people with varying needs and the type of support required. As able-bodied persons, it is typical for us to have our own concerns about growing up, education, livelihood, family and occasional thoughts of what life might be like in our senior years. But for individuals with special needs, these may not even be fleeting thoughts for some of them. Some lack the ability to plan and defend for themselves, others could be limited for different reasons, thus, becoming an added worry for their parents who are ageing.MSF has also continuously engaged different groups to understand and assist through provision of integrated support services aimed at promoting inclusion of persons with disabilities in the community and to enhance their quality of life. The third Enabling Masterplan for 2017 to 2021 spells out some of these enhancements.In my conversations with my residents and having attended focus group discussions for people with special needs, their families, care-givers and employers, I realised that there is still much we can do as a society to assist them. How are we ensuring opportunities for all via our social strategies in education, healthcare and housing?While some would argue that many recognise the need to include people with special needs and acknowledge their existence, I cannot agree that we have truly taken actions to be more inclusive in embracing people with special needs. There seems to be a lack of in-depth lifecycle planning support pillars for people with special needs from childhood to adulthood to their old age.If we must begin the process, it starts from helping and partnering them, allowing them to be a part of our community from young. Indeed, this is a much needed step to provide their parents, family and themselves a little more comfort that they can live, work and socialise as a part of the community while comfortably being themselves.There are a number of support that we can provide for them. I will cover more of this in the Committee of Supply debate on their living environment in public housing, their employment post-schooling age and how the community and businesses can partner them. Here, I will focus on two aspects.One, rally the society to be inclusive from young. As a start, we must recognise the presence of people with special needs and their ability as an individual. Pre-schools and formal schools can do more to educate the children in embracing differences and welcoming them from within the school community. As individuals, all of us, too, can be more gracious, accepting and forgiving to families who have children of special needs. They deserve a place in our community, from the neighbourhood playgrounds to public transport and common dining places. There is no need for cold stares, harsh words or social media commentaries for any special needs individuals. They are individuals with their own rights and well-deserved to be treated with dignity like any other person. We should have campaigns that counter such negativity and give more room for families with special needs to be out in our community, to share our common spaces and feel at ease that they are one of us.Second, provision of affordable legal support and streamline the search process of assistance schemes suitable for their needs. For special needs individuals, some may have disabilities or are cognitively challenged to handle legal matters on their own when their legal guardians are no longer around with them. Be it the Will, having an acting Attorney-in-fact or managing other legal matters that involve their daily lives, they are more likely to need better access and support at affordablecost on a regular basis. Having trusted parties who have a long-standing relationship with them and being able to defend their interests are crucial for those with special needs.With the extensive assistance schemes available across the Ministries or specific to their special needs, it is not an easy task for them to navigate and know how to seek help. It is uncommon today for each special needs person to have been assigned to a social worker or being supported in network groups. When their legal guardians are no longer able to extend the help in organising their life needs, this will be an escalating concern and possibly more pressing for them apart from financial aids.Mr Speaker, as a country and Government, we always begin with good intent to support and provide the best possible care for our citizens. This continues to be the guiding principle in our process of extending financial and broad-based support to the society. But as we progress in our nation building, it is also our responsibility to deliberate how much more we can do, whether a fiscally sustainable assessment is made for support packages and how do we address the future state of support that we hope it to be. My concerns, notwithstanding, Sir, I stand in support of the Budget.3.20 pmMs Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson): Mr Speaker, Sir, the COVID-19 outbreak is a test of our nation's social fabric, our collective strength and character.Around the world, we observed how the deficit of trust in government and public institutions prevented or worsened efforts to contain and control the outbreak. In one Asian economy, hundreds rallied for days to protest against plans to turn some buildings into quarantine centres. In one European economy, hundreds in a town protested having their fellow countrymen who were COVID-19 evacuees from China from being quarantined in their town, despite assurances by the government that none had symptoms of infections. They put up roadblocks, burned tyres and hurled stones at buses, resulting in several injuries. Out of desperation, the health minister declared she would spend the next two weeks locked up in quarantine with the returnees. In other places, government attempts to refute false rumours, although backed by medical experts, were ignored at best and stoked fear at worst. People hoarded critical supplies and deprived them from people in high-risk environments who needed them the most. In a public health crisis, it is heartbreaking to see such anti-social behaviours. Where has the “leave no one behind” belief gone to?It is a different scene in Singapore, thankfully. In Singapore, we see some of the ugly behaviours, too, but there is a lot more of the good acts that we have observed. Where we saw frontline workers being discriminated or denied service by some individuals, we see an even stronger response from many Singaporeans who wrote messages and prepared gifts to express their support. We also see ground-up initiatives by groups of volunteers who engaged seniors and the more vulnerable within our communities to give out practical items, such as hand sanitisers. Of course, another example is when the silent majority seemingly came to life during the recent \"Twitter Parliament\", suggesting that hoarding and, therefore, depriving others of essentials should not be encouraged.With decisive leadership and strong public institutions, we have so far kept the situation under control. Our leaders regularly inform the public of the latest development in Singapore, and the Government responds to queries with clarity and transparency. Civil servants worked tirelessly every day since before Chinese New Year to ensure \"no stone left unturned\". Medical frontliners bravely stepped up to care for patients, and cleaners worked extra hours to ensure a clean and safe environment for Singaporeans.In fact, our efforts to combat the COVID-19 virus has been widely recognised. A Harvard study described Singapore as having \"gold standard\" for case detection; WHO was \"very impressed\" by Singapore’s response to COVID-19. Kudos to our Government and frontliners! Kudos to my fellow Singaporeans who demonstrated calm, reason and compassion in the face of uncertainties that allowed us to control the outbreak quickly. Thank you for showing us and the world how beautiful Singapore is.These would not have been possible if not for the trust between our Government and people, as well as the strong social cohesion forged over time. We must cherish this and never be complacent.Speaker, Sir, I see Budget 2020 as one that preserves jobs and social cohesion. In the midst of our battle against the coronavirus, we have this Budget debate. I am glad that in his Budget, the Deputy Prime Minister addressed the impact of COVID-19 on our economy as well as the long-term needs of Singaporeans. Budget 2020 is a responsive Budget that prepares Singaporeans for the challenges ahead. The $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package helps companies to stay liquid, thus preserving the jobs of Singaporeans. Against uncertainties arising from global headwinds, it is essential to ensure that Singaporean workers remain supported and adaptive, with measures to encourage them to be more productive and innovative.In particular, SMEs – comprising 72% of our employment – are most in need of supportive measures to help them retain local employees. Jobs are important to Singaporeans' livelihood, important to keeping families financially buoyant and important to social cohesion. Various studies, including one by the World Bank in 2013, have shown that job access has a direct impact on a society's trust and civic engagement. The same 2013 World Bank report also stated that jobs and the types of jobs influence people's aspirations, social beliefs and their sense of belonging to the country. I, therefore, applaud the decisive move to set aside a whopping $4 billion to help Singapore companies and Singaporeans in this time of difficulty.To ensure that the Government's intent of providing our citizens with strong and reliable support is achieved, I have two suggestions, based on feedback from my residents and grassroots leaders.First, ensure the good will that comes from these Budget measures ultimately flows through to the micro and small enterprises. For instance, passing oncost savings from commercial landlords to tenants and ensuring access to the Enterprise Financing Scheme by micro enterprises. Banks may be less motivated to serve individual micro enterprises, even with a greater risk-share by the Government, but these enterprises can band together if facilitated by the respective merchant associations.Of course, it is not just the Government that can help the smaller enterprises. I note the recent launch of a “SME Help Fund” that aims to help SMEs whose businesses are struck by the COVID-19 outbreak. Member companies pooled together $5 million and leveraged technology platforms to offer low interest loans to affected SMEs, which must also be majority owned by Singaporeans. From application to disbursement, the process is as fast as 48 hours. I was told that the responses from SMEs have been overwhelmingly positive. When I spoke with one of the fund's founders, JL Family Office CEO Andy Lim, he said they wanted to help SMEs and that this is one practical way of how Singaporeans help Singaporeans. I was very heartened to hear this.This is an example of how different groups in the society can take the initiative to help fellow Singaporeans in times of need. Their efforts complement the Government's and, collectively, these efforts help to strengthen our social cohesion.Second, provide more recognition and support for freelancers. Freelancers are especially vulnerable to changes in the economic conditions. Many events and work assignments are cancelled or deferred as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. A number of them have taken their own initiative to band together online to support each other as they are hit by the outbreak. I trust that the unions are actively reaching out to them. Freelancers are especially vulnerable to changes in the economic conditions.Many events and work assignments are cancelled or deferred as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. They have little savings or \"fats\" to see them through this period of work drought. Worse, if they have a family to support.Many of the financing options available now are not readily accessible to them as they are not registered companies and have no GST registrations. Could the Government consider extending the working capital loan to this group of freelance workers? Or help them access the other measures aimed at helping businesses with cashflow to keep them afloat as well?As we address the immediate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, we should also not lose sight of investing for the future. I am glad that the Government continues to have a firm grip on this, evident in the other components in the Budget.Still, I would like to reiterate the importance of investing in our people to ensure a high concentration of high-quality talents in Singapore, for Singapore. During this period of economic uncertainty, it is a precious opportunity for us to re-skill and upskill our workforce, catalyse the transformation and get ready for the future economy.Singapore is clear about our future economy direction. We need talents to fulfil this. Technological disruptions have resulted in jobs becoming obsolete. But with technological advancements, many more new jobs will be created.We need to provide good and meaningful jobs, where workers are empowered and have agency. But to take on these future jobs, Singaporeans need to be equipped with the right skills and possess international perspectives.I support the ITMs and welcome the next bound of SkillsFuture initiatives. Singaporeans should be encouraged to work with employers to determine what courses to attend to ensure job relevance and be guided along as well. However, I wonder if these measures are enough.Also, to attract top enterprises to Singapore to create good jobs, we need a high concentration of skilled workers with a critical mass of world-class talents. Singapore excels in the biotech sector now after 20 years of investments. A critical success factor is the large pool of high-quality talents that we built up over the years, enabling Singapore to lead in this sector ahead of competition. Similarly so for other sectors. Looking ahead, Singapore needs to offer an abundance of talents who not only meet existing demands but also attract future unicorns to Singapore from the region and beyond. As talents beget talents, there is a virtuous cycle to this.Yet, global competition for skilled workers is stiff. In a February 2020 McKinsey's article , it was reported that 87% of companies surveyed around the world say they either are experiencing manpower gaps now or expect to experience it within a few years. Respondents expect market and technology trends to play a big part in these shifts. More dramatically, the World Economic Forum describes the world as facing a \"re-skilling emergency\" One billion people globally need to be re-skilled by 2030. Companies and countries are motivated to close the skills gap fast. Singapore needs to be even faster – one to two years' window of opportunity, according to some prominent business leaders I encountered from within and outside of Singapore.The Government has been investing and introducing targeted programmes to build up our talent pool. As the Chinese saying goes, \"百年树人\", talent cultivation takes time. But we are racing against time. Topping up with foreign talents may be part of the solution, but strengthening our Singaporean Core is, of course, the core solution. Therefore, to reinforce the momentum, may I suggest the following:First, we need a stronger push for Singaporeans to re-skill and upskill, and right-skill from young. I am happy to know that coding is now compulsory for all upper Primary students, in the form of a 10-hour coding enrichment programme. This is a good step, but I hope the Government can consider taking an even bolder step and recognise it as part of formal curriculum. This signals the importance of this subject. Furthermore, some would argue that computer language is increasingly akin to English or mother tongue languages that we learn in school. As the digital future is inevitable, why not take that step further and recognise coding as our third language?We also need stronger incentives to encourage adults to take on future economy-oriented courses. The additional SkillsFuture credits in this year’s Budget are a welcome addition, but to help Singaporeans pick up essential skills that allow them to compete globally over the long term, there should be stronger guidance and more targeted initiatives.Second, we must continue to encourage international exposures for students and younger working adults. It is essential for young adults to be given full internship opportunities as well in countries like US, China, Israel and other emerging economies with a vibrant tech scene such as Indonesia and Vietnam, for them to gain a global perspective and foster meaningful networks that will benefit them and their professional community.In this year's Budget, the Asia Ready Exposure Programme, together with the Global Ready Talent Programme, are timely. Business China, too, is working closely with MOE and other agencies to promote internship opportunities for our tertiary students and young working adults to intern in China, and the response was encouraging. We need to work on availing more of such overseas opportunities for our young, so that we can cultivate a critical mass of young Singapore talents with a world view.Third, we need to deepen our relationships with global top talents and facilitate value transfer to our own local talents. Could we consider a mentorship programme that attracts top talents and company founders from around the world to mentor our youths and start-ups? Singapore is a hub for many top technology and professional talents, and we should make use of this opportunity to groom our younger generation and benefit from their mentors' expertise, experience and networks. This initiative will also increase Singapore's mindshare among these top talents and foster our youths' image as motivated, hardworking and bright young individuals who are globally competitive.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Mr Speaker, through this COVID-19 crisis, we can see the composure and decisiveness of Singapore leaders, the efficiency and meticulousness of organizations within the Government, the bravery and kindness of our frontline workers, as well as the generosity and mutual concern that Singaporeans have for each other. It has shown what Singapore is capable of, and how beautiful this country is.In comparison, we have seen how citizens from other countries have lost faith in their government, discriminated against their fellow countrymen, prevented disease control measures from being implemented, resulting in the spread of the disease. It is indeed disheartening.Hence, the deep trust between our people and the Government is especially valuable. This was built over the years, with government policies that have always put the long-term interests of Singapore and Singaporeans at the core, allowing Singaporeans to enjoy a good quality of life and stable jobs. There should be no let up in efforts to build this trust.In difficult times, the ability of governments to figure out the root cause of problems and implement targeted solutions to minimise impact on the people is very important. Hence, I am very happy that the Deputy Prime Minister has introduced a budget to deal with the situation during this critical period. Besides ensuring adequate supplies for frontline workers, funds have also been set aside to reduce the impact on companies' cash flow, so as to protect jobs.Although it is important to deal with the current situation, it is equally important to plan for the future. Singapore has experienced many rounds of economic transformation and ventured into new emerging industries at different junctures, maintaining its lead successfully. The key to our success is the high concentration of good quality talent here who can meet the skills demand of new industries.With Singapore moving towards the future economy, there will definitely be a strong demand for talents. In view of the shortage of talent around the world, some corporate big wigs believe that Singapore may only have a window of opportunity of one to two years to get ahead in artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. Attracting talent is a short-term solution, but more importantly, we need to ensure that Singaporeans upgrade their skills, and that we nurture our young to equip them with future skills and global mindsets. Although talent development schemes have been included in both last year’s and this year’s budget, I hope that the Government can consider the suggestions below.One, incorporate coding into mainstream curriculum, ensure that all Singaporean children have basic understanding of coding so that they can have a head start.Two, instil the spirit of lifelong learning in our people and encourage them to make use of the SkillsFuture Credit to take up courses relevant to the future economy.Third, continue to encourage students and young working adults to intern in countries where technology development is more rapid. Aside from gaining experience, these internships will also broaden their horizon and their networks.Fourth, set up mentorship programmes where top-notch talent and entrepreneurs can be matched with young local talents and start-ups with potential, to build capabilities, share experiences and network.(In English): As we enter more uncertain times, with pressure on our community from the COVID-19 epidemic and global financial turmoils, I am heartened to learn that this year’s Budget is comprehensive and inclusive. This is a Budget for our people and our future. I support the Motion.1.37 pmProf Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Our Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister has delivered a remarkable Budget this year. In this regard, I wish to speak on 3Ms pertaining to the Budget. You might think, given the generosity of the Budget that my 3Ms stand for Massively More Money. But no, the 3Ms I will speak on today are mobility, maturity and mentality.First, mobility. Social mobility is the holy grail of governance. In Singapore, we have made persistent efforts to boost social mobility with significant injections of social spending, especially within the past decade. Budget 2020 is no exception, especially with its Care and Nurture and Stabilise and Support Packages. I welcome the various measures including grocery and GST Vouchers, kindergarten, transport and school meal subsidies that will certainly help lower income families ease their financial burdens. We cannot underestimate the impact of such subsidies. I recall that when I volunteered at the charity Food from the Heart, children from poor families who received monthly food goodie bags saw improved grades. Why so? Once their parents stopped bickering over where the next meal would come from, and there was money left over for transport, the children started to attend school more regularly and this translated tangibly into improved academic performance.Beyond these financial measures, however, what more can we do to ensure that our society is not overly stricken by the proverbial Great Gatsby Curve? This curve describes how family resources and social networks influence a child's future earning potential. When this curve is too pronounced, the advantages conferred by family wealth and connections get entrenched over time, leading to social stratification. As the World Bank's Fair Progress report argued, low mobility, both real and perceived, can dampen an individual’s aspirations for the future.To more directly address such discouraging perceptions, we need to initiate more systematic mentorship for children of less advantaged backgrounds so that they are inspired by role models who have successfully risen from similar circumstances. As the saying goes, \"you cannot be what you cannot see\". We therefore need to invest more strategically in more after-school programmes where students from lower income families are offered targeted academic support and career guidance in order to bridge the privilege gap.My second M is maturity. As our economy matures and digitalises ever more intensively, we are at a critical crossroad to consider future growth directions. Clearly, in our well-connected society where we are bound together by the internet of people and also the internet of things, a promising path for us to explore is the one illuminated by big data. The application of data analytics in virtually all aspects of life, including finance, business, urban planning, healthcare and education, can generate powerful insights for enhancing resource optimisation, service delivery and efficiency gains. With data to fuel Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, we can forge a culture of data-driven innovation that aims to raise our quality of life.But that begs the question as to who should own the data and be allowed to profit from it. The social compact between people and corporations which are collecting data about us is riddled with inequity. Indeed, the ‘compact’ is one of distinct asymmetry between the big technology companies and consumers. Hitherto, technology companies such as Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba have selfishly hoarded their data, from which they distill critical insights to create market dominating products and services. If we continue to let these Goliaths have exclusive rights to exploit the data that they harvest essentially for free from all their users, what chance is there for the scrappy start-ups of the world to innovate for the greater good? We must leave the door wide open for start-ups to compete against the incumbents. Oxford University professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, coauthor of Reinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data, suggests adopting a “progressive data-sharing mandate” that forces companies above a certain size to share some of their data with smaller competitors. In the same vein, the European Commission recently issued a document titled “European strategy for data” which outlined potential steps it may introduce to require companies to share and pool data.Just as Singapore was a front runner as one of the first countries to launch a Model AI Governance framework, we should also consider blazing the trail and pioneer regulation on the collection and use of big data. This will have the twin benefits of levelling the playing field between first-movers and start-ups, and fostering a vibrant pro-innovation environment.Importantly too, academics should not be left out of the data game. At this point let me declare my interest as a professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design and a member of the Social Science Research Council.Mr Speaker, our world is beset by a host of wicked problems such as sharpening income inequality, climate change, rising populism and the damaging scourge of online falsehoods. The best and brightest talents in our world-leading universities have much to offer by way of problem solving, as the multi-faceted COVID-19 crisis has highlighted. With more concerted regulation around data sharing, we can ensure that universities are well-equipped with robust data to conduct research for societal benefit.I would like to further suggest that there be greater data sharing by the Government, for example from its national level surveys. Such data can help to facilitate productive and evidence-based policy analysis by academics and researchers in our Universities and research institutes. Concerns around data security can be addressed through the generation of synthetic data that realistically represents authentic data but that protects privacy and confidentiality. I am glad that plans are apparently underway for such data sharing and I welcome further details as soon as they are available.Moving forward, we should also consider studying the experience of countries such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom that have advanced data sharing infrastructures and procedures, to identify best practices that we can seek to emulate. Data sharing by the Government is a strategic shift we must undertake to fully realise our Smart Nation ambitions.Precisely because our economy is maturing and transforming, change is indeed the only constant and our workforce has to be prepared for that reality. I therefore applaud the SkillsFuture Credit top-ups in Budget 2020. However, this infusion of funds will be for nought if attitudes to upskilling do not shift.My last M is therefore mentality. Our collective mentality around upskilling must change, from \"nice to have\", to \"must do\". And this mentality has to be shared by workers, employers and educators.During a recent conference, I had the benefit of exchanging insights with practitioners and researchers in the adult learning eco-system. We all converged around several sobering points. That while our workers need to constantly upskill, they do not find the necessary motivation to do so. This arises from a combination of work-life pressures, inertia and resistance to change, and a sense of defeatism that the new skills they acquire will not translate into concrete improvements in their salaries or job prospects. Separately, when employers are dismissive of their employees’ needs or interest to upskill, their motivation is further undermined. Such negative mentalities around upskilling must be addressed, be it through nudges, support programmes or public education efforts.Importantly too, we cannot expect Singaporeans to develop an inherent drive to learn unless they associate schools and other learning environments with positive experiences. As I mentioned in my Adjournment Motion in Parliament last month on the fear of failure, the overwhelming achievement orientation in our education system does not imbue an intrinsic love for learning. Instead, students become Machiavellian and grade-oriented, while instructors then teach to the test to meet KPIs. To become a nation of lifelong learners, we need to accelerate our transition away from a focus on grades towards broader and more enduring learning outcomes. Students should not just be learning, but learning how to learn.With greater attention to these three Ms of mobility, maturity and mentality, I am confident that we can overcome the challenges ahead, both distant and immediate. I wish to therefore conclude by underlining my strong endorsement of the subsidies announced in response to the current COVID-19 crisis. The $4 billion package announced to help workers remain employed through three months of offset wages offer a vital lifeline in current climes. By helping an estimated 1.9 million local workers through this key Jobs Support Scheme, we can help to allay the anxieties of these workers and their families and demonstrate that ours is an inclusive society where we have a head, but also a heart. Mr Speaker, I support the Budget.3.47 pmMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Budget. I will like to first declare my interest as the CEO of ComfortDelGro Taxi Business.Given concerns over COVID-19, I am proud that Budget 2020 is the result of quick response, built on a deep understanding of what Singaporeans are feeling and going through. The Budget is one which will help us all to ride through this period of global panic in a calm manner. At this juncture, I would like to thank the frontline staff, especially the healthcare heros, MOH’s team and all involved in fighting the COVID-19 for their sacrifices, dedication and determination.I am also heartened that in preparing Budget 2020, Deputy Prime Minister Heng and his team had spoken to more than 1,000 people, including corporate chiefs to collect feedback.As someone who is active in both the public and private sectors, the issue of balancing regulations to take care of the interest of the regulators and the companies being regulated, is one which continues to be of concern of many. Following my speech during Budget 2019 debate about cutting red tape, I was heartened that there were anecdotal improvements.But apart from extraordinary situation, it is important for the policy-makers to consult the stakeholders regularly. Such consultation is a continuous process and a never-ending journey.One area that catches my attention is SGX's competitiveness. Following my Parliamentary Question in January 2020, last month, I am glad that SGX has relaxed the need for quarterly reporting and announced that half yearly reporting will suffice. This is a good move to reduce compliancecosts.However, SGX seems to be losing its shine. I understand that many local companies are listing on other stock exchanges in New York, London and especially Hong Kong, over SGX. In 2019, 10 Singapore firms were listed in Hong Kong, raising US$155 million. This is a 25% increase from 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Computer gaming accessories company Razer chose to list not in Singapore but in Hong Kong in November 2017. Some of these firms listed overseas are apparently drawn to better liquidity and higher valuations. I have personally spoken to the head of two companies that listed their companies in Hong Kong last year. They have also affirmed the same.Worse, according to Euromoney.com, delistings over the last five years have outnumbered listings. The number of companies registered on the SGX fell to 741 at the end of 2018, from a peak of 782 in 2010.From the reply to my Parliamentary Question in January 2020, I understand that SGX is not tracking the number of local companies that choose to list in other countries. It may be wise for SGX to connect with some of these companies, to find out why they choose to list their companies overseas. This would also have implications on Singapore’s ambitions to become a prime financial hub.Next, Mr Speaker, I would like to touch on the issue of sustainable transport. As a person intimately involved in the management of a large fleet of more than 10,000 taxis, a sustainable transport is an issue which I am most concerned with. On a yearly basis, ComfortDelGro Taxi replaces more than 1,000 vehicles on average and we are keen to replace them with cleaner vehicles that emit less carbon dioxide. Currently, we are trying to speed up the replacement of diesel taxis with petrol-electric hybrid taxis. Meanwhile, we also have four full electric taxis.Thus, we are fully supportive of Singapore’s drive to move towards a sustainable and \"green\" transport and phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040. I am heartened by MOF’s announcement to launch an Electric Vehicle (EV) Early Adoption Incentive or EEAI by providing 45% rebate off the Additional Registration Fees (ARF), capped at $20,000 and subject to a minimum ARF of $5,000. At the same time, the Government will impose an additional road tax of up to $700 per year for EV.When we do a calculation based on the more popular Korean full electric passenger car, the EV Early Adoption Incentive scheme does not appear to be attractive. In fact, the current Carbon Emission-Based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS) which offers a rebate of up to $30,000 off the ARF is more attractive than EV Early Adoption Incentive Scheme of only $20,000. The additional road tax makes a EEAI even less attractive.In addition, cabbies that drive EV have to endure the inconvenience of taking 30 minutes to one hour to fully charge their electric taxis. The promise of halving the charging time and halving thecost of car battery every three years still remain a promise. In fact, some in the car battery \"industry point out that exaggerated claims are commonplace, and that not everyone is convinced” that planned car battery breakthroughs will become a reality.Thus, I will like to clarify with MOF do they really think that the EV Early Adoption Incentive will entice fleet owners like us to choose EV over hybrid vehicles.Do not get me wrong, I am supportive of having more \"green\" and \"clean\" vehicles. It is just that we do not want Singapore to bet on the wrong \"green\" car like the experience we have had of CNG cars.Rather than putting all eggs in the one basket, I would like to suggest considering other alternatives to not replace, but supplement EVs, like fuel cell or hydrogen vehicles. China, Japan and South Korea are already working to put millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles on their roads, because it is not only cleaner, its driving range and refuelling time are comparable to gasoline cars.We understand that in the second half of 2019, last year, the Prime Minister's Office has awarded a hydrogen feasibility study to American engineering giant Kellogg Brown & Root, to assess the feasibility of importing hydrogen for downstream uses, ranging from vehicle fuelling to power generation. Can PMO or LTA share their preliminary thoughts while waiting for the full report of the study?This year's Budget, Mr Speaker, is the Unity Budget with an eye on COVID-19. Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me to speak in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.] The COVID-19 outbreak has seriously impacted many Singaporeans, including taxi drivers. When people talk about the smaller crowd in downtown areas, I lament the fall in businesses for taxi drivers.During the SARS outbreak, even though there was a drop in foreign tourists, locals still go to work as usual. But today, many office workers take turns to work from home and this has worsened the situation for taxi drivers.We thank the Government for launching a special relief package for taxi drivers on Valentine’s Day. Taxi drivers will receive a rental rebate of $10 per day from the government, and another $10 per day in rental rebates from taxi companies. In total, taxi drivers will receive rental rebates of $20 per day. Yet, taxi drivers still complained. Taxi companies then decided to provide another $16.50 in daily rental rebates to taxi drivers. In other words, taxi drivers will enjoy up to $36.50 in rental rebates per day. Even though taxi companies will be running at a loss by doing so, for the sake of taxi drivers and the taxi industry, taxi companies still decided to go ahead with the rental rebates. But still, many taxi drivers are unable to make a living. We therefore hope that Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat will consider providing more assistance for taxi drivers. Thank you!(In English): Their loved ones are most impacted by the outbreak for taxi drivers. All the taxi companies are providing additional help over and above the Government's Special Relief Fund or SRF of $10 per day. Some taxi companies, including ComfortDelGro Taxi, is providing additional rental rebate of up to $26.50 over and above the SRF. That is, cabbies are getting a total rental rebate of up to $36.50 per day until the end of March 2020. With these additional rebates, the taxi companies will go into red over the next few months. Even then, the cabbies are still suffering a significant drop in their net income. Thus, I call on Government to do more for cabbies. Perhaps, the Government can consider matching what the taxi companies are doing for the cabbies by increasing the quantum of Special Relief Fund (SRF).Singaporeans will remember the good deed by the Government. Just a couple of days ago, one cabby by the name of Robert Chew wrote me a touching email. Let me read out an excerpt of what he wrote: \"I would like to thank you as Member of Parliament for bringing our feedback to our Government and working with them to offer us some financial assistance by way of supplementing our daily rentals.These are indeed very hard times for us as our incomes have been severely hit and many drivers have given up. Not to mention also the daily stress of fearing for our own health as we are frontline service providers who do not want to be a problem to our loved ones.Sir, I would like you to know that we appreciate any help your company and the Government are providing us to help us survive this episode. This fight is far from over and may last several more months.Let us work together in our fight against this epidemic as we look forward to coming out of this crisis stronger and better. We most certainly will overcome. We must!May you and your loved ones stay safe and healthy.\"Robert summarises nicely the sentiment of many taxi drivers. Other than P2P drivers, the livelihood of Singaporeans working in the private sectors have been badly affected by the negative impact of the economy.Those working in the tourism industry are the worse hit. Gig workers and freelance workers are also badly hit. Many freelance workers are engaged by Government departments. For example, fitness instructors engaged by Active SG, orchestra music instructors engaged by MOE schools are having their earnings significantly reduced when organisations are cancelling activities involving more than 50 people.While there is a cancellation clause which is included in the contracts of some legally savvy freelancers, many others do not. For such cases, I will like to appeal to MOF to allow the Government agencies to pay up to 50% of the fees charged by freelancers even when their engagements are cancelled due to COVID-19. Such help will go a long way in keeping them afloat.Another vulnerable group are those in society who receive help from charities and non-profit groups. As fund raising has almost come to a standstill, this is because many businesses are more concerned with survival than corporate philanthropy. Thus, we must do what we can to help keep these charities and non-profit groups going and stretch their fund-raising dollars.I will like to suggest the Government extend the Bicentennial Community Fund (BCF), where the Government matches $1 for each dollar of donation. It was supposed to end on 31 March – this year – 2020 but I strongly advocate that it be extended until the end of 2020 so that the beneficiaries whose lives depend on the money raised from well-wishers can continue to get help.In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has done a very good job of managing COVID-19, putting all resources in finding and healing the sick. The greater challenge now is how we can pull together and help one another. Those who can must help those who cannot to tide over the economic crisis. The Budget has made a very good first step and the rest of the journey is for us to walk together and together we can overcome the odd.Mr Speaker: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.20 pm.Sitting accordingly suspendedat 4.00 pm until 4.20 pm.Sitting resumed at 4.20 pm[Deputy Speaker (Mr Lim Biow Chuan) in the Chair]Debate on Annual Budget StatementDebate resumed.Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member): Mr Deputy Speaker, from the 14th to the 15th century, wages in Europe doubled and inequality declined significantly. Inequality would not rise to the same level until the 1700s. The cause was not productivity improvements or up-skilling. Unfortunately, the cause was the Black Death, also called the plague, which killed by some estimates more than one-third of the population in Europe. The demand for labour went up and land was redistributed amongst the survivors. The plague is a zoonotic disease. The bacterium is endemic to rodents and carried by the fleas that infest rats. The plague originated in China, was carried west along the Silk Road by traders and spread thence to Europe, most famously, by Italian traders fleeing the Mongol siege of Caffa by ship.The Plague destroyed not only populations, but also the existing social and economic order throughout Europe. Governments of the day responded with novel and extreme measures. In England, the Statute of Labourers 1351 made it illegal for workers to demand pay greater than those wages prevailing before the Plague. While there is little evidence it was effective, it appears to have contributed to a major English peasant revolt in 1381. Governments also realised, perhaps belatedly, that inequality itself weakened society's ability to resist the plague. The poor could not afford treatment, but they could pose a risk to all if they contracted it. As a result, towns hired plague doctors to treat rich and poor alike without payment. Necessity is the mother of public health.I tell this story in the hope that history does not repeat itself. But it is startling what the parallels are between the plague and COVID-19. The policy questions have changed little over the years. COVID-19 is more than a public health risk: it is a threat to the present global political, economic and social order.China's strong policy of containment has essentially decoupled China temporarily from the global economy. Singapore has suffered more than most. In 2018, 3.4 million tourist arrivals – nearly one in five that year – were from China, and China is our largest trading partner. The efforts of Budget 2020 to address the economic impact of COVID-19, and beyond that, to restructure the economy, are timely and I fully support the intent behind them.But even if, as we hope, the impact of COVID-19 will be short-lived, it would be irrational to plan to return to the same apparently prosperous world that we inhabited just a few months ago. Countries and companies are assessing whether economies and supply chains should be so tightly coupled. So, for our part, we should take this opportunity to strengthen weaknesses in our economy and society that may yet affect the course of the outbreak and our resilience to future ones.International experts, Mr Deputy Speaker, have judged that Singapore's approach to COVID-19 is a model for public health systems worldwide. We should be proud of the hard work that our healthcare and Home Team institutions have put in to protect our society.We can afford the tremendouscosts of containing COVID-19 because we have a highly successful market-based economy. But there is a paradox there. Our efforts to contain COVID-19 now depend on many people in the frontline who have benefited much less from the market economy than others have. Our efforts also do not depend on the private healthcare sector. They instead depend on the strength of our public healthcare institutions which are paid for outside the market.The key contradiction which the present crisis has highlighted is the growing and invidious divergence between market prices and social value. To understand this, we need to deconstruct the ideology or the myth of market forces. In crude terms, the myth is the idea that the price and distribution of goods and services, determined by competitive market processes, must be efficient and socially appropriate. This model of market forces underlies our policy thinking about economic restructuring because for the most part it works well. It is impossible to protect all jobs or industries in economic restructuring, because doing so would cripple the efficiency of the economy and harm ourselves in the long run. However, we should never assume that the market price is equivalent to social value. Market prices may be efficient, but that says little about it being equitable or socially desirable.What comes to mind to illustrate this is how the frontlines of our war against COVID-19 have been increasingly manned by people whose market prices are low but social values immeasurable, especially during a public health crisis. Rosalind, one of the cleaners at my University, does more on a daily basis to protect our students and staff from COVID-19 than I possibly can.She and her colleagues go into our offices and classrooms and toilets daily to make sure that they are disinfected. The cleaning frequency has been stepped up. She bears the risks of cleaning up dirt and spills and worse things and she has more work now but the same pay. Our Town Councils likewise largely depend on foreign workers and elderly local cleaners who do jobs that few of us would accept for the same pay.This disconnect between market prices and social value is not a problem confined to those of the lowest incomes. Security officers put themselves at risk serving quarantine notices and screening for sick persons at our institutions. One such officer did, in fact, contract COVID-19. Our emergency medical responders and nurses put themselves at risk every day as their work puts them in direct physical contact with the sick. And our general practitioners (GPs) are working under very difficult circumstances to screen and treat the sick, to make the judgement call if a patient is a suspect COVID-19 case. Yet, the rewards for GPs have never been very high compared to that for specialists and surgeons, to say nothing of the pay for nurses and first responders. There may be market reasons why elective aesthetic surgery gives a doctor a much better living than primary care, but surely, there are few social reasons why this is so.A second reason for interrogating the myth of market forces is that there is no guarantee that market prices and allocations reflect efficiency. In theory, prices in a competitive market track the marginal productivity of any resource closely. This implies the market allocation of resources should be efficient at producing the greatest useful output for society at the leastcost. But this need not be true, especially once we consider the importance of resilience in maintaining social functioning in difficult times.Market forces have concentrated the production of medical personal protective equipment, such as surgical masks, in a relatively small number of factories worldwide, many of them in China. Medical institutions worldwide do not keep significant reserve stocks because the supply chain is usually swift and reliable. In normal times, yes, the globalised system of production is superbly efficient. We would, in fact, question normally whether it is good value for money if MOH were to start subsidising thecostly production of surgical masks in Singapore, or the creation of a stockpile that far exceeds that of projected clinical use. The COVID-19 outbreak, however, demonstrates the limitations of efficiency as the sole judgement criterion.The Straits Times reported on 21 February, just last week, that private hospitals in Singapore have seen big drops in foreign patients. Usually, they get about 40,000 medical tourists a month. But now, many have cancelled their appointments. Now, normally, it is a good thing to have a thriving private medical sector in Singapore. It gives patients choice; it makes Singapore a medical hub. But it is likely if the COVID-19 outbreak worsens, that our GPs and public hospitals will continue to be severely stretched with a high caseload while the private specialist sector may well be short of work. This is neither resilient nor efficient. And yet, it is the market outcome, because there is market demand to pay for excess capacity in the private sector. There is none to pay for it in the public sector.Our public healthcare system is under pressure, as are healthcare systems worldwide, to be more efficient, to cut waste and slack. To keep public healthcare prices low, we schedule appointments for subsidised healthcare as tightly as possible, to extract the most out of our manpower and equipment. This comes at a hiddencost to the resilience and morale of our healthcare workers. In a crisis, these effects become more salient. Any lack of slack means that in a crisis, we risk having insufficient spare capacity to deal with unexpected surges in demand. We must then rely on our healthcare workers to work overtime to keep us safe.China and now Korea’s experience in managing the current crisis are important reminders of how vulnerable our public healthcare system could be. We are just one unlucky \"super spreading\" incident away from severely taxing our public hospitals. To be sure, the Government has done well in planning ahead. The NCID, which has been a mainstay of our fight against COVID-19, is proof that we have taken the lessons of SARS to heart. But we must guard against the short sighted pursuit of efficiency at the expense of resilience. We may have to prepare for a new normal where increased globalisation and the disintegration of public health systems worldwide mean that we will face imported disease outbreaks more frequently than ever before.Let me now turn to inequality, Mr Deputy Speaker. The COVID-19 outbreak is likely to hurt the livelihoods of those who already live precarious economic lives – the freelancers, the workers in small and medium enterprises. The market forces myth explains inequality through the argument that pay is equal to productivity. This in turn forces us to emphasise improving our productivity in order to raise wages, which in the long run is more sustainable.But there are any number of market distortions which would explain why the productivity-to-pay relationship, while it may hold on average and in the long run, does not always hold for the individual or even the sector. In Singapore, wages for low-income workers stagnated for much of the 2000s. The occasional paper on \"Income Growth, Inequality and Mobility Trends in Singapore\" published by MOF in 2015, documents that from 2004 to 2009, cumulative, per-member household income growth was only 4% for the the lowest quintile as opposed to 19.5% for the top quintile.Were the prices right for low-wage labour in the mid-2000s? If we believe fully in price theory the answer is yes and there is nothing that can be done about it beyond Government support and transfers. But, fortunately, wiser heads prevailed.In 2012, former Chairman of the National Wages Council, Prof Lim Chong Yah, called for \"wage shock therapy\" to raise the wages of bottom income earners while freezing that at the top. While the Government did not agree with Prof Lim's approach to the problem, it nonetheless worked through the tripartite framework to introduce the Progressive Wage Model, which provides an explicit framework for pushing salaries up in key low-wage sectors. We have seen a strong reversal of formerly stagnant wage growth for low-income Singaporeans. As reported in the latest Key Household Income Trends 2019, cumulative real growth in per-household member income was 29.5% and 31.8%, for the first and second deciles, from 2009 to 2019. Top decile income growth, meanwhile, slowed to 15.9%t for the same period.Does this mean that productivity for low-wage workers has jumped by 30% over the last decade? It is difficult to take at face value without more study the price theory implication that cleaners have suddenly become hugely more productive, even with the benefit of training. I suspect it is more likely that wages were simply too low, possibly because of the easy access back then to low-wage foreign workers and our low-wage workers' lack of bargaining power.In any case, the solution to being a nurse is not for that nurse to become a doctor and the solution for cleaners is not to hope that our children do not have to take up that job or to depend on an inexhaustible supply of lowcost foreign labour. Society needs both nurses and doctors, cleaners and lawyers. The solution is to pay and respect low-wage workers better.Mr Deputy Speaker, in recent days, key corporations in Singapore starting with Temasek Holdings and now including SATS, SMRT and Capitaland, and perhaps more, have decided to restructure and reduce the wages of senior management staff in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. I applaud these moves to demonstrate solidarity with Singaporeans on the ground. They are important not just for the morale of frontline staff, who may yet facecost-cutting, but also sends a signal that the risks andcosts of COVID-19 should be socially distributed.Let me suggest that this year, we orient all efforts towards protecting and even increasing the wages of lower paid Singaporeans, and paying for it by restraining and restructuring the wages of those higher up – which would include, I would suggest, hon Members as leaders in their own professions. Today, we commend our cleaners and security guards, nurses and public health workers, for being in the front line of protecting us against COVID-19. We acknowledge the work of our public transport workers, our hawkers and shopkeepers, in keeping our supply lines and life running as normal. Can we give them a tangible increase in their salaries to acknowledge their sacrifices?If we do not have the words to express our gratitude, then at least, let us have the dollars.More fundamentally, COVID-19 and the demands of economic restructuring should have us question whether our social risk sharing institutions, for unemployment, housing and health care, provide sufficient protection and resilience. There was a lively debate yesterday on unemployment insurance in the Chamber and I think the discussion should continue. We cannot depend just on charity for filling in the gaps, especially since charitable activity may also be hurt by an economic or social crisis. In particular, our resilience today to major shocks such as COVID-19 depends very much on the government of the day enacting strong and tailored measures, because we do not have many automatic risk sharing measures in place. This is both a strength and a weakness because resilience depends on the performance of the political leadership of the day. Events near to us show that this cannot be guaranteed.I started this speech by noting how the Black Death fundamentally reshaped economic and social institutions in Europe. The long-run history of economic inequality is that significant reductions have only occurred in the wake of huge disasters such as the Black Death, the collapse of empires, the first and second World Wars. Left unspoken is whether inequality played a role in precipitating these collapses.At the moment it seems, if we are fortunate, COVID-19 will only be a shock, not a disaster, for the global economy. But we have to continue the work of strengthening and restructuring our economic, and societal institutions, to ensure that when the next test comes, Singapore will stand as resilient as it has today. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Government’s Budget.Mr Deputy Speaker: Senior Parliamentary Secretary Low Yen Ling.4.37 pmThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling): Mr Deputy Speaker, the emergence of COVID-19 has in recent months, placed several threats in our horizon near and far. However, we take heart that since SARS, we have built up our defences and are better prepared to deal with this virus outbreak today. We are deeply thankful to our healthcare workers, government agencies, cleaners and many frontline personnel who have put their duties first, to protect us.Apart from these, we have a strong foundation of community help and network to respond to challenges that come our way. Since its formation, the Community Development Councils or CDCs have played a critical role in partnering the community to strengthen bonds and help vulnerable groups. We have the “\"BC\" mission – A stands for Assist the Needy, B stands for Bond the People, C stands for Connect the Community. The mission is even more crucial than ever, in a time like this.Each of the five CDCs – Central Singapore CDC, led by Mayor Denise Phua; Northeast CDC, led by Mayor Desmond Choo; Northwest CDC, led by Mayor Teo Ho Pin; Southeast CDC, led by Mayor Maliki Osman and Southwest CDC, helmed by myself – each of these five has its own set of local assistance schemes to meet local needs, as well as programmes to foster community development and ownership. A diverse range of partners from the community contribute to improving the welfare of the community and those in need. For example, in 2019, the CDCs rolled out 111 local assistance schemes that benefited close to 156,000 beneficiaries.Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has in this year’s Budget, provided $20 million for the CDCs to better meet the needs of their residents through local initiatives. To this end, the five CDCs have been working together to launch an island-wide initiative to providemeals in the heartlands for vulnerable families. This effort not only complements the Care and Support package to help Singaporeans who need extra support with thecost of living, it will also bring business to many heartland food joints, coffeeshops which are feeling the effects of the slowdown due to COVID-19.Yesterday, Member Mr Png Eng Huat had suggested that the grocery vouchers for low-income families be extended for use in small retail shops. In the past few years, our local constituencies have been working with heartland retailers and businesses to meet the nutritional needs of low-income families. The mayors and the CDCs welcome the timely $20 million injection of funds which will provide additional resources for us to scale up these efforts across the nation and reach out to more of those in need, as well as boost the support for local businesses and heartland enterprises.The upcoming Free Meals and Drinks scheme will be redeemable at participating coffeeshops, participating food courts and participating heartland enterprises. Details are currently being worked out and will be released in due course.The $20 million Meals in the Heartlands initiative is expected to benefit some 100,000 vulnerable families and each CDC will administer the scheme accordingly to meet the needs of its residents.Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, being able to have a decent meal is a form of security and support key to boosting the resilience of families-in-need.Earlier, Prof Lim Sun Sun also talked about the importance of nutritional meals. These are important for the kids to start the day right. For example, the ability to have a simple breakfast of kaya toast and eggs – whether with Milo for the kids and Kopi-O for the parents – as a family can start the day right, and put parents and kids in a better mood to bond, talk and share. These kinds of moments can often be elusive for those preoccupied in making ends meet. So it is even more important for them to receive greater help in this area.Taking a ground-up approach, the CDCs will work closely with partners in the community, merchant associations, F&B outlets, self-help groups, SSOs, grassroots leaders and volunteers to form a cohesive network of support to shore up the nutritional, physical and psychological needs of this group of Singaporeans.This win-win solution not only provides businesses with additional revenue during uncertain times, it serves the families in need and brings the community closer together in mutual support.This type of collaboration benefits the community at large and the CDCs have often involved volunteers and organisations who reach out to those in need. For instance, we have had the Central Singapore Milk fund for children; we have the NorthEast Community Vouchers; we have the NorthWest Food Aid Fund that provides food vouchers, cooked meals and food rations; we have the SouthEast Roxy Family Fund for daily expenses like diapers, food or medicine; and we have Food Connect@SouthWest and Meal Service@SouthWest.In the coming months, we will see the CDCs widening our outreach and deepening our engagement with partners as we work together to beat the COVID-19 storm. SMEs form the lifeblood in our economy. SMEs make up 99% of our enterprises and SMEs hire close to 70% of employees in Singapore. Since 2013, seven years ago, CDCs have partnered Enterprise Singapore, key trade associations and business chambers to each set up an SME Centre in each of the five CDCs. The SME Centres reach out to heartland enterprises and support them through capability workshops, Government schemes, advisory services and help them improve productivity.Last year, 6,800 SMEs benefited from the business advisory sessions from the SME@CDC centres and another 2,400 companies took part in 60 capability workshops to enhance their brand, productivity and marketing. The CDCs will continue to do more for our SMEs, as they face the need to constantly evolve, to stay relevant in today’s disruptive climate. From training and talent development, to business advice and community partnerships, we will continue to deepen our efforts with heartland businesses, to energise their growth and survival, for SMEs provide the majority of jobs in Singapore.Apart from working alongside SMEs, the CDCs are dedicated to improving the future and prospects of Singaporean workers.In 2017, we started SkillsFuture Advice to help Singaporeans navigate their lifelong learning journey and capture opportunities to skill up with courses that they can attend with their SkillsFuture Credits. The CDCs have since surpassed the initial outreach target of 80,000 individuals in three years. By 2019, more than 100,000 Singaporeans have participated in over 3,700 SkillsFuture Workshops in the heartlands, in the community.Building on this strong foundation, the five CDCs look forward to closer collaborations with SSG, WSG and e2i to expand our SkillsFuture Advice outreach. All five CDCs will intensify our momentum to help Singaporeans, especially mid-career and also mature workers, to be better equipped and resourced to cope with the impact that COVID-19 may have on their careers. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, please allow me to continue in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Neighbourhood shops and micro businesses in the heartlands are important members of our community and are important to the larger community as well. Over time, many residents and shopkeepers have become friends, and the entire neighbourhood feels like a close-knit family.The merchants' associations are important organisations that represent merchants and they exist in many constituencies. Grassroots organisations, Community Development Councils and various merchant associations have always been in close communication, working together to organise various activities and events to inject vibrancy into the neighbourhoods, boosting pedestrian traffic to bring in more business.Here, I will share an example.In the Bukit Gombak constituency where I serve, a Chinese New Year event that is similar to the River Hongbao is organised every year. Businesses in the neighbourhood would participate in the CNY bazaar, and there would be large lantern displays and Getai to attract residents to the town centre to shop, eat and enjoy Getai performances. Both residents and neighbourhood merchants benefit from this win-win event, and I know that many constituencies have similar CNY bazaars.From this example, we can see that maintaining the vibrancy of communities and neighbourhoods can help to ensure a sustainable business environment for heartland merchants.In terms of funding, besides the $1.6-billion-dollar Care and Support Package, the Government will also set aside $20 million for ComCare schemes under the CDCs. This will allow CDCs to work with neighbourhood merchants to help low income families through their individual platforms. At the same time, this will help to boost residents’ spending at neighbourhood shops and coffee shops. More details will be revealed by the five CDCs soon.The mission of the 5 CDCs is to build a caring and cohesive society, and many assistance schemes by the CDCs are people-centred. In 2019, we implemented 111 measures that helped more than 150,000 beneficiaries.To better assist our neighbourhood shops in achieving success, the CDCs, Enterprise Singapore, trade associations and merchant associations have banded together to set up SME centres to provide advisory services for heartland merchants. In 2019, about 6,800 shops have made use of this advisory service. Another 2,400 small and micro businesses have also participated in workshops to improve their operations, management and promotion strategies.Although large merchants have the advantage of providing new and diversified offerings, neighbourhood merchants have the advantage of providing personalized services, as well as friendships and mutual understanding with customers built over the years. I think this is extremely valuable.People say that there will be businesses for shops as long as the community is vibrant. One crucial factor is taking proactive measures to drive customer traffic in the neighbourhood. It is the shared responsibility of everyone to ensure that the community and neighbourhood remain vibrant, to build a pro-people, pro-business and friendly neighbourhood.(In English): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the months ahead may hold uncertainties, we can be sure that on the ground, the five CDCs are fortifying the network of support across the heartlands and strengthening our local businesses, our vulnerable families and Singaporean workers. With concerted and specific measures as well as fresh resources, we are closing ranks with fellow Singaporeans and heartland enterprises as well as local businesses.As we fight back, as we steady our ship, as we hold our ground, we can get through this together. For no matter what the odds may be, we stand as one – SG United – overcomers, to emerge even stronger. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support Budget 2020. [Applause.]4.51 pmMr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee): Mr Deputy Speaker, this year’s Budget debate is taking place under the dark clouds caused by a global pandemic. But Singaporeans can take heart that we are better placed than almost any other country to deal with this crisis and to mitigate its impact. The Government has gone all out to address the potential fall-out from COVID-19, and my residents would like to express their thanks to the Government for this Budget and all the help that has been offering. My residents have also asked me to express thanks to our frontline workers whose bravery, commitment and calmness have inspired all of us to carry on.However, COVID-19 is a once-in-a-decade threat to the economy and the full effects are not even apparent yet. Even if it does not get worse, it has already blasted a hole in the world’s supply chain. Chinese manufacturers have shut down for a month and many industries are hurt because of lower Chinese demand and because of the broken Chinese supply chain.To cushion the impact on local businesses, the Government has introduced a comprehensive set of measures in this year's Budget. Protecting businesses means protecting jobs and protecting families. This is why I support the Government’s efforts to inject additional stimulus in the economy. I am especially appreciative of the Stabilisation and Support Package where $4 billion will be made available to local businesses to tide over short-term dislocations, and the Transformation and Growth Strategy where $8.3 billion will be made available to local businesses to position for the future.Mr Deputy Speaker, nevertheless, I would like to make four additional suggestions for the Government to consider.The first point relates to feedback from the SME community. The Stabilisation and Support Package will help small enterprises but it is really too small for medium enterprises. There is a \"sandwich\" class of companies where it is too big for such small help to matter but too small to survive for long periods of negative cash flows. The Corporate Income Tax rebate of 25% of tax payable is a welcome measure, but it is capped at $15,000. This is a small drop in the ocean for such companies. Even a $600,000 loan guarantee by the Government may not be enough for a medium enterprise whose revenue may be up to in the region of $50 million to $100 million a year. I would like to urge the Government to calibrate and scale this assistance according to the size of the company.The second question relates to the timing of the help. What can the Government do to speed up cash flow assistance to these companies? It has been almost six weeks since the virus started to impact travel and commerce. Many businesses are already running down on their reserves and they cannot depend on their suppliers to extend credit because their supplies are similarly impacted. Cash flow is the lifeline of every business. From what I heard from the banks, it will take until mid-March to approve new loans and these loans will not be disbursed until mid-April. For some, this will be too late. So, I would like to ask the Government what more can we do to open the spigot to make sure that these companies do not go down because of the virus in the short term.The third point relates to what we must do to prevent short-term pain becoming chronic, in the form of long-term unemployment among mature PMETs. If companies go under because of COVID-19, many jobs will disappear and may never come back. Even if they come back, they might on to a different, younger crowd. Employment for mature PMETs exhibits a ratchet effect. It only goes one direction. It is much easier for a mature PMET to lose a job than to be hired back into one.So, therefore the emphasis on SkillsFuture 2, SkillsFuture Entreprise Credit and the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package in this year’s Budget is therefore much welcomed. I am also gratified to learn from the Deputy Prime Minister Budget speech that in the last three years, productivity has risen by 2.6% per year and real median income has risen by 3.6% per year. These are positive developments for the Singaporean worker. But I would also like to ask how we can get Singaporeans to do the relevant training, instead of spending their SkillsFuture money on new skills and interests that might not help them to stay employed.I totally agree with the Deputy Prime Minister when he said that enterprises know best what are the skills needed for their businesses to transform. But, under the Enhanced Training Support for SMEs, the Government already pays for 90% of the course fee and 80% of worker’s salary while employees are undergoing training. Minister Josephine Teo also said in her speech that funding is not the constraint or the impediment that is preventing workers from getting training. But I know that SMEs are not willing or are unwilling to send their workers because it is just too difficult for them to take their workers away from day-to-day work. Therefore, the new SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit that is capped at $10,000 per year, I feel might see a very low take-up rate.I would like to suggest for the Government to intensify efforts to help businesses to find replacement manpower to cover their employees when they are undergoing training. And this might even include having to pay the salary of such temporary replacement. I think this would encourage upskill their workers while not compromising their day-to-day activities.Residents have also given feedback that it is difficult to get placement into the Professional Conversion Programmes which operate on a \"place and train\" basis. Place and train means that you have to get placed in a job first before you can undergo training. But it creates a catch-22 situation for mature PMETs. They need the training to get a job, but need to get the job to get the training. So, they are stuck. I would urge the Government to provide more than the hiring incentive of 20% salary, capped at six months that is announced in the Budget, in order to further incentivise companies to make the first move.The fourth point is what do we do for the longer term, how do we increase the resilience of our economy and our workforce? A key lesson learnt from the COVID-19 virus is that even when you have money, you cannot buy a mask. Similarly, in the area of manpower, we need to build up our self-sufficiency. We need to reconsider outsourcing.I would encourage the Government to identify areas of critical need or essential services, and to build up a core of local talent. The speed and ability of GovTech to swing into action and update from \"gov.sg\" or \"maskgowhere\" is testament that in-house ability matters in times of crisis. Another example would be the need for experienced engineering tech talent, experienced engineering staff during the SMRT crisis in 2015.It might be cheaper to outsource in the short term, but the strategic value of insourcing would be very apparent and outweigh thecost when disaster hits.One way of doing so is to build up a local eco-system of SMEs with the requisite local expertise to operate these industries to become our version of Mittelstand. Germany has its famous Mittelstand – the heart of German industry. The unifying mindset is a focus on social, inter-generational and community responsibility. Mittelstand companies contribute to the local economic and social welfare. They also offer stability and loyalty to their staff by investing heavily in training and retaining staff in times of crisis.This stands in contrast to the more common Western style of capitalism, with an exclusive focus on profits. Their overriding obligation is to their shareholders, not to other stakeholders like workers. This \"winner takes all\" mentality might have also contributed to the growing inequality problem that we see in the world today.From a societal perspective, it is not always clear that unbridled capitalism will lead to the best outcome. Perhaps it is time for us to explore how we can build a core of locally-anchored, stakeholder-conscious Singapore businesses that can help our economy in both good times and bad times.Singapore already has many of the ingredients to cultivate our own Mittelstand eco-system. We are uniquely placed to work together as a government and as a society to achieve a bold vision. Enterprise Singapore and the private sector can work together to identify the right industries. EDB can can bring these businesses to Singapore.Innovation can be driven by research and academic institutions, with funding from NRF and RIE, and there can be tripartite collaboration with the unions to make sure that our workers have a voice. Trade associations can also help to mobilise the workers.Our emphasis on lifelong learning will provide a skilled workforce of craftsmen and domain experts. Perhaps what we really need is for the Government to invest in a Mittelstand fund or to start a Mittelstand development bank to catalyse the entire SME eco-system. Give it an inspiring name, articulate the bold vision, set an ambitious timeline and make it happen. Let us show our pioneering spirit once again. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Budget.5.02 pmMs Foo Mee Har (West Coast): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this year’s Budget is set in one of the most uncertain times of Singapore’s history. Our economy grew by a modest 0.7% in 2019, its weakest growth since 2008 Financial Crisis. With the current COVID-19 outbreak fast spreading across the world, the outlook for 2020 is even more bleak and uncertain.Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has provided much-needed assurance, by announcing a rock-solid Budget that inspires confidence to press ahead. People say money cannot buy happiness. But I can think of many things money, in the right hands, can provide: peace of mind, opportunities to better one’s circumstances and hope for the future. Budget 2020 offers us that. Let me elaborate.Singapore’s economic foundations have been and continue to be strong. The fiscal strength has enabled Deputy Prime Minister to announce one of the most expansionary Budgets in 20 years – $106 billion to support families, seniors, workers and businesses. Budget 2020 will provide \"Stabilisation and Support\" for the current COVID-19 outbreak, enable Singapore to seize opportunities to transform and grow, as well as to build and secure our future.The money will come from diversified sources of tax, Net Investment Return Contributions (NIRC) from our reserves as well as accumulated surplus from previous years’ fiscal prudence and discipline. It is at times like these when we really appreciate having this reservoir of financial resources to keep Singapore on an even keel, come what may.It is at times like these when we should also reflect on the significant contributions made by NIRC. Its contribution to fund total expenditure has grown from 13% in 2015, it is now 22% in 2020 – projected to be 22% in 2020. So, in five short years, it has gone from 13% to 22%. Besides being the single largest source of revenue, NIRC is also projected to grow at 9.3%, compared to only 1.7% total increase in all the taxes in FY2020.I am worried about calls from some quarters for the Government to take more from our reserves, rather than to safeguard our strategic \"asset\". Is it not unwise to kill the \"goose that lays the golden egg”?I am even more worried about the growing dependency on NIRC. As NIRC, we know, is subject to volatility from tough investment environments, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether it might be prudent to consider setting a threshold on NIRC dependency, beyond which recurrent spending should only be funded through recurrent revenue.I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for responding to my call to delay increase in GST. Whilst he has assured us that GST will not increase for at least another two years and has also provided support in the form of GST Assurance Package, some Singaporeans are still wondering why would we need to raise GST at all, given the apparent budget surpluses and additional capacity of $6 billion of GST offsets? Increases incost of living is foremost in the minds of many people, particularly retirees.Sir, I would like to repeat my call to the Deputy Prime Minister to continue looking for other sources of revenue. Even though the wealthy are already contributing substantially to our taxes through a progressive Personal Income Tax, GST, property tax, ABSD and so on, I really believe there is still room to consider wealth tax and estate duties – all aimed at building an even fairer and more equal society.Some may be concerned that a re-introduction of estate duties, previously abolished in 2008, may harm Singapore's status as a leading wealth management centre and incentivise wealth and business owners to engage in complex structures for tax avoidance. As other forms of wealth taxation are now being considered by a number of other countries, the notion of wealth taxes generally do give rise to concerns about how taxpayers might react.But income and wealth inequality are global issues and there are wide recognition amongst governments and wealth and business owners of the need to address them. As the world moves towards considering broader and fairer tax systems, Singapore should maintain its principles of keeping tax structures simple and tax rates low whilst meeting the interests of all stakeholders, particularly of those who are most in need.So, now we live in a new era of automatic information exchange under the Common Reporting Standard and other global requirements to disclose beneficial ownership across the world. Transparency in ownership and value of assets is rapidly becoming a new norm.When tax is well structured at competitive and fair rates, together with tax treaties similar to those to which other jurisdictions are parties, an effective estate duty and, perhaps, accompanying wealth tax regime may actually be an allure for assets to be maintained in Singapore.In a world of turbulence and uncertainty, Singapore's world class infrastructure, rule of law, financial and political stability is priceless for the peace of mind of the wealthy. This is especially so when the environment in Hong Kong, Asia's other leading wealth management centre, has been marred by months of street protests and instability, and long-term uncertainties regarding its tax and legal systems.Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister Heng for a very generous Budget with measures to help withcost of living, training, jobs and retirement adequacy. Whilst there is a really \"feel good\" sentiment on the ground, more needs to be done to help Singaporeans understand exactly how these measures will benefit them. And I am picking this up when I am on the ground trying to explain.There are many different schemes to keep track of, from the new schemes such as Care and Support Package, Matched Retirement Savings Scheme, GST Assurance Package; to enhancements to existing programmes such as the Silver Support Scheme and SkillsFuture top-ups. On top of existing support programmes, they all have very different qualifying criteria, some based on housing type, individual income, household income, age criteria and often combinations of criteria.And I do agree these multi-faceted targeted schemes are morecost effective than broad based ones, but together they can become too complex for the average person on the street to digest. I would like to suggest that the Government provide a Personalised Budget Statement or make available a Budget Calculator on how Singaporeans and their family, based on their unique circumstances, can stand to benefit from Budget 2020.Sir, regarding support for businesses, I urge the Deputy Prime Minister Heng to really stand ready to do more. The coronavirus outbreak has hit the businesses hard. The general feedback is that many businesses are experiencing up to 50% drop from their usual volume, and the Budget measures are too small and too short term to address these challenges.Besides the dramatic impact on tourism, aviation and retail sectors, COVID-19 has significantly disrupted supply chains in manufacturing to even vegetables for the restaurants. Locked-down Chinese cities are unable to supply the parts that have become integral components of the supply chains here. Many workers are stuck in China, unable to return. Activation of Business Continuity Plans, extra cleaning, medical leave, leave of absence and so on have put additional pressure oncosts and manpower.It will be especially crucial, I agree with Member Ong Teng Koon, to provide relief for cash flows to tide them over this difficult period. With $7.7 billion of budget surplus left for this term of government to tap on, Deputy Prime Minister Heng has ample ammunition to do more, I hope. I would like to ask if he would consider a second package if circumstances warrant it?Would the Deputy Prime Minister consider extending the Jobs Support Scheme to six months and increase offset of wages to 12%, as what was done during the Global Financial Crisis? Would he consider extending the support package to more sectors? Would he also consider coordinating efforts with banks to restructure loans, so that SMEs and affected individuals can get moratorium on repayments for, say, up to six months, just to ease the cashflow?In the meantime, it is heartening to see large corporations and landlords rise to the occasion in support of the smaller ones – including rental rebates by Changi Airport Group to retailers and the Hope fund, put together by the Young Business Leaders of SBF, to support SMEs with immediate working capital. This is the time for the big boys to chip in and help their smaller brothers.Sir, long-term transformation and growth remain the key focus of this Budget. The issue of manpower constraint continues to be a major struggle for businesses across the board, even as we are resolved to reducing our dependency on foreign workers. We need to urgently develop new ways to find, train and retain the talent necessary to sustain growth.Learning from the Swiss, industry associations can play a pivotal role in galvanising players in the sector to join forces in curating and delivering impactful training for the industry. I believe that Singaporeans will become more accepting of supplementary foreign labour if we actualise the systematic plan to train and develop them for attractive careers.Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, finally, Budget 2020 showcases Singapore's capacity to build a bright and sustainable future. Deputy Prime Minister had set ambitious goal to tackle climate change and has put aside a $5 billion Coastal and Flood Protection Fund. The spark in Singapore's climate change journey has been lit in this Budget. Singaporeans can look forward to a sustainable future and participate in exciting new developments as we manage Singapore's transition to a low carbon, low emissions, clean economy.In conclusion, Budget 2020 inspires confidence in uncertain times. It has provided Singaporeans with peace of mind, ample opportunities and a sustainable future. The concerns over COVID-19 will eventually fade over time, but the efforts to transform Singapore as a Global-Asia Node of Technology, Innovation and Enterprise will ensure Singapore remains exceptional. I cannot agree more with the Deputy Prime Minister Heng, when he says that the Singapore Spirit is strong and growing. Together, we will advance, as One Singapore. I support the Budget.Mr Deputy Speaker:Mr Christopher de Souza.5.15 pmMr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah): Sir, I had my speech finalised on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, I found out that I was speaker number 48 out of 48. What can you say after a list of 47 esteemed speakers? So, I decided to rework my speech.The past two days' speeches – many made passionately – reminded me of a BBC documentary which I had listened to last month while I was on the way to work. The documentary was called \"disagreeing better\". No. It was not a guide about how to better disagreements. Rather, it was a guide about how to resolve disagreements better. Hence, the title \"disagreeing better\".Why is this relevant at all? Because the documentary touched on the negative repercussions on societies when they are polarised. The danger the BCC documentary sought to point out is the very danger so many of us in this House seek to battle. In short, in Singapore, we do things quite differently. We seek unity here. Hence, the Unity Budget.Why is this important, especially at this time? Because the crisis can bring out the best or the worst in society.Will there be disagreements along the way? Of course. These will relate to fiscal measures, social policy and issues of societal values. But how we resolve these differences – and come out of a large crisis or mini crisis – is key. The willingness to listen, to be open with each other, to share and risk empathy; and then to decide. These are all essential for an efficient decision-making body and have been so aptly displayed by so many of the 47 speakers before me. So many of us in the Chamber regard the unity of Singapore and the united response to the crisis as the priority.Ms Jessica Tan gave real life examples from her constituency as to why providing opportunities in education is key. Ms Denise Phua shared how these opportunities should be extended to SMEs. Mr Desmond Choo talked about giving working mothers and mothers on maternity the best shot in their careers.And you see characteristics of each in Budget 2020 – the umbrella of opportunities for re-skilling, re-training and advancement for the Singaporean workforce. You see the undercurrent of unity in so many of the speeches. You see that in Mr Png Eng Huat's speech where he talked about the need to unite rather than point fingers and stigmatise, how we should not ostracise China, and that it was good that we sent them a second humanitarian shipment.So, the BBC documentary sought to point to the danger of disunity. Yet, in this House, through the 47 speeches before me, you see an over-arching priority to unite, and I think that is quite novel in the world today. And it is, in fact, inspiring and encouraging. Hence, Unity Budget.If we look at the globe, there is sectarianism, I versus you, hardly any effort to build the common ground or common paths forward. Yet, so many of the speeches in this debate here have had as their foundation the topic of unity.But it is not only about unity. There is also the need for transparency, honesty – as Mr Cedric Foo emphasised; and being open with difficult facts too. A \"framework of honesty\", if you like. And I see how that framework is being deployed in the Budget. For example, being upfront with Singaporeans early about the future hike in GST, being open about why over reliance on the NIRC may not be fiscally prudent and why at this stage, we need to think of raising GST in the future.This is being open and mature. It makes for the politics of trust and honesty. It makes for a reliable decision-making process.If I may be bold enough to say, it is the same framework that we see being deployed within the COVID-19 taskforce – sharing the infections numbers, the discharged numbers, the ICU numbers, sharing information about the clusters and importantly, readying Singaporeans for the method we will use to deal with the virus in the longer time, whichever of the scenarios plays out.So, as with Budget 2020, as with the debate of the 47 speakers before me, as with the manner in which the Ministerial taskforce in COVID-19 is addressing the difficulties facing our country today – facts discussed candidly and openly, and a sharing of ideas and suggestions and then, importantly, decisions. This is what we are doing in this Chamber. This is our Singapore way.Singapore is like a steady ship in the ocean. We have gone through storms together before and we can go through them again.Perhaps, in this moment of the COVID-19 outbreak, we should also take the opportunity to try to remove the hierarchical way that some in our society view jobs and professions, with certain professions viewed as more prestigious while others jobs viewed as less dignified. In my view, such stratification is not the way it should be. This was also a point raised by Prof Yaacob and Mr Alex Yam, and I agree with them. If anything, the COVID-19 crisis is proof to all of us that everyone is important – everyone has a role to play – everyone is needed.Allow me to explain. In order to stem the spread of the COVID-19 virus, office buildings carry out temperature taking. Those manning the temperature booths, often security guards, are important as they provide a first line of defence. But the guards are putting themselves at risk. Other measures that have been taken are the increased cleaning and disinfecting of places, such as playgrounds and high touch points, such as lifts and hotel rooms. Our housekeeping staff, uncles and aunties in the hotel industries, frontline staff, cleaners – they all play such an important role in the prevention of the spread of the virus. Many have had to work overtime due to the crisis to meet the increased rate of cleaning common areas. And yes, these diligent and determined workers also put themselves at risk.In a Straits Times' interview entitled, \"Coronavirus: It’s a dirty job, but if I don’t do it, who will?\", one of the cleaning companies has had their teams work seven days a week these few weeks, all hands on deck, including the manager Mdm Tay. I quote from the article, \"Few Singaporeans are interested in working in the cleaning industry, but Madam Tay hopes that through the work they do – especially during this outbreak – people will learn to respect the job. We are helping to prevent the spread of the virus in Singapore'.\", says Mdm Tay.The immigration officers are on the front line, so are the enforcement operations managers of MOM. The nurses and those working at the service counters at hospitals and healthcare institutions play a crucial and important role. Their professionalism is inspiring.All workers on the frontline should be appreciated. None of us asked for this to happen. None of us want this to happen. But since it has happened, we need all hands on deck. There should be an appreciation that everyone, even those who play less visible roles, are important to our society. We should be less focused on hierarchy and more focused on appreciating each member of our society, especially as we battle COVID-19 in a singular and united determination. And I hope that we will also retain this experience, that everyone in our society is important, even after we overcome this crisis, as we forge our collective future.Sir, even as we are in a ship together, we need to ensure that the Budget has in place measures that are of practical help to our people. This is especially important to the hotel, tourism and food and beverage industry. According to a snap survey done by Restaurant Association Singapore, close to 60% of restaurants in Singapore stated that they are not prepared and equipped enough to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 on their operations. For those who rely heavily on tourists, the estimated loss could go up to 80%.To help the food and services sector during this period, the Adapt and Grow initiative was expanded. In relation to rentalcosts, for food and beverage and retailers, it is good that there are full month rental waivers for some hawkers and half a month of rental waivers for commercial tenants of Government agencies. However, for those on private property, it is the landlords of those retailers on private properties who are given property tax rebates and encouraged to pass on to the retailers. Instead of relying on the goodwill of landlords to pass on savings to their lessees, is there no other more direct way we can alleviate the challenges that those in the food and beverage industry are facing? For example, will the Ministry consider requiring landlords to declare whether they have passed on the rebate to their lessees? And if so, how much has been passed down in dollar terms? Already, it has been reported by the Restaurant Association Singapore that 200,000 employees have been affected since the outbreak.As Business Continuity Plans already need to be in place, it may also be a good opportunity for businesses to test and hopefully prove that flexible working arrangements work. If it works, more firms may be ready and confident to try adopting it as an available standard practice to support our working parents with\tyoung children\tand working care-givers. For\tsome\tof the enterprises who want to take this opportunity to change the way they work, this Enterprise SkillsFuture Credit may come in useful.Furthermore, in relation to using this crisis as a place to plan for the future, there is one particular area that we have announced our intention to look for new sources of\tsupply\tand look into the capabilities\tfor\tlocal manufacturing, that, is, masks. It would be especially useful since epidemics will spread between countries more quickly. But the issue of masks\talso points to a larger priority, namely, the diversification of our supply sources.I have spoken\tabout\tfood security before.\tCurrently, the coronavirus or COVID-19 is affecting the world\ttrade of\tgoods\tand supplies.In light of this, we need to take stock of what other items, besides masks, we potentially need to manufacture on our own in the future, and if we do manufacture them, whether our supply sources for the materials are sufficiently diverse.Secondly, for our businesses who are facing problems with diversification of supply sources, what support from the Government is available for them to facilitate the making and establishing of connections with more diverse trade partners?Budget 2020 also has its eye on the future.\tBusinesses have\tbeen\tgiven\tincentive\tmeasures\tto\ttake\tthis opportunity to re-skill and re-train workers to increase future productivity. We also need, however, to instill measures that make learning something that is embedded in the way things are done in Singapore, long term. This is crucial as we are facing an economy characterised by disruptive technology. Change will come. Just like COVID-19 presented itself to us as a disruption, or another phrase by Deputy Prime Minister Heng, as \"a spur and a test\" that COVID-19 has presented to us, we cannot run away from such a change, disruption, spur or test.We need to change the way we think about learning. Year after year, we cite the Chinese saying, live until old, learn until old, that is, lifelong learning. We learn that in Primary schools too. But, do we really live it? Do we see learning as a chore rather than a joy? Do we see learning as a burden rather than a privilege? I would like to suggest that we think about the way we can build lifelong learning into the curriculum of students. It is not just a good attitude to have in life but necessary in the kind of economy Singaporeans will face in the future.A good example of what could be done is what is already being done at SMU. We could broaden what is being done at SMU.At SMU, disruption is built into part of the syllabus through the way the core curriculum is designed. The core curriculum has three pillars: capabilities, communities and civilisations.Under capabilities, students pick up skills, such as numeracy and management lessons, to navigate the modern world. Internships are integrated with the other pillars, with a work-study scheme available so students can take up longer internships and earn credits at the same time. Under communities, students discover Singapore's Asian context through courses under the areas of economy and society, technology and society, cultures of the modern world and community service.SMU's core curriculum was designed to nurture a generation of \"adaptive and adroit graduates who are technically competent and agile, socially conscious and adept in their communities and inspired by the timeless puzzles and challenges confronting humanity.\" This instills in students the aptitude for and attitude of lifelong learning. That is something other schools could consider so that the students will not be theorists only but be able to handle both theory and practical, having the dexterity to apply strong foundations of theory into new real-world applications.Sir, I move on to my third and last topic – climate change –\tand why I stand in strong support of the $5 billion set aside to shore up our coastal defences.Although there are some in Singapore who disagree with the use of the phrase \"climate change\" as they are of the view that the climate is and always has been changing, allow me to just use the phrase to point out some trends we should be concerned with, particularly relating to the rise in sea levels. Historical data measuring average sea levels of the Singapore Strait from four research-quality data points at Tanjong Pagar, Raffles Lighthouse, Sultan Shoal and Sembawang, indicate that there was a 2.9 mm yearly increase of our sea levels from 1984 to 2011. So, sea levels have risen and ice in the ocean has been melting and physics will say that there will be an increase in sea levels.What this means is that low-lying small nations such as the Maldives and Tuvalu may face, or in fact, are facing existential crisis.Mr Deputy Speaker: Mr de Souza, you have three minutes more.Mr Christopher de Souza: I will take two, Sir. Leaving one spare. Thank you.Because of the dire consequences rising sea levels have on Singapore's future, it is good that the Budget takes these longer term challenges into account and prepares for them. The $5 billion investment to ameliorate the effect that sea levels have on Singapore is thus commendable and far-sighted.In my speech, Sir, I compared Singapore to a steady ship in the ocean. As a country, we have weathered storms together.\tThe Budget Statement and the debate on it are important to train our focus on how to ensure we get through the storm as one united people. As Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat wrote in his Facebook the day before he delivered the speech, \"we\twould not\thave\tbeen\table\tto\tact\tquickly\tand decisively, if not for our deep reserves. I do not mean only our financial reserves... I also mean the reserves of\tstrength,\tresilience,\tempathy and resourcefulness among our public servants and fellow Singaporeans\".It is such resilience that allows us to plan well into the future, well beyond this storm. It is our Singapore way –\tresponding as one people, tirelessly safeguarding our country’s reserves and future. It is for these reasons, that I stand in support of the Motion. [Applause.]Mr Deputy Speaker: Leader of the House."

        "Content": "1.59 pmThe Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong): Mr Speaker, Members. Minister Lawrence Wong and I first spoke about COVID-19 in Parliament in January. And I updated Members again during theCOSdebate earlier this month. The situation continues to evolve rapidly and we would like to take this opportunity to provide a further update on the latest situation and our strategy going forward. As the task force involves multiple Ministries, may I have your permission, Mr Speaker, to invite the relevant Ministers to respond to clarifications on their respective responsibilities?Mr Speaker: Yes, please.Mr Gan Kim Yong: As of yesterday, there are more than 370,000 COVID-19 cases and over 16,500 fatalities from the disease worldwide, and the epicentre has shifted to Europe and, perhaps, United States. The number of deaths in Italy alone has exceeded that in China. World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.How the outbreak develops globally will depend on the strategies and efforts of countries around the world. WHO has advised that we can still change the course of the pandemic if all countries take the necessary actions to contain the outbreak.Otherwise, we will continue to see the number of affected countries and cases rise rapidly. Regions such as China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, had experienced a reduction in the number of cases a few weeks ago, but have started to see increases in new cases in the past few days driven by imported cases, arising mainly from residents returning from abroad. We face similar challenges.Currently, in Singapore, we have 558 confirmed cases, of which two have passed away; 155 have been discharged and most of the rest remain stable or are improving. From late-January to February, Singapore saw an initial wave of imported cases from China. Some of these resulted in several local transmission chains, such as the Life Church and Missions and Grace Assembly of God combined cluster which resulted in 31 cases.However, in recent weeks, we are seeing a second wave of imported cases. In the past week alone, the number of cases in Singapore more than doubled, from 266 to 558 cases. Almost 80% of these new cases were imported, all from countries other than China even though we continued to see around 1,000 residents and long-term pass holders return from China in the past week. The top three sources of importation to Singapore are the United Kingdom, the United States and Indonesia.And over the coming weeks, the number of cases will continue to rise, as some of our around 200,000 overseas Singaporeans return home from all over the world.We have slowed the local spread thus far through a three-pronged approach: first, reducing importation; second, detecting and isolating cases early; and third, emphasising social responsibility and good personal hygiene habits.To reduce the risk of importation, we have stemmed the inflow of travellers by imposing border controls and issued travel advisories to advise Singaporeans to defer their travel plans until the situation around the world is under control. Minister Lawrence Wong will elaborate on this later in his speech.We have also strengthened checks at our borders to detect and isolate cases before they come into contact with the Singapore community. For example, since January, we have progressively put in place temperature screening, health checks and swabbing at all our checkpoints. All who meet the suspect case definition are conveyed directly to the hospital, while all symptomatic travellers as well as some selected travellers are swabbed as a precautionary measure.Beyond our checkpoints, we have also put in place a system to detect cases early, through surveillance at hospitals, polyclinics as well as Public Health Preparedness Clinics.We have re-activated Public Health Preparedness Clinics just over a month ago and today, we have more than 900 clinics offering subsidised consultation and treatment for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents with respiratory illnesses. Singapore residents have benefited from more than 267,000 subsidised attendances at these clinics thus far, on top of that at our polyclinics.To date, we have done around 39,000 tests for COVID-19. This translates to about 6,800 tests per million people in Singapore, compared with around 6,500 in South Korea and about 1,000 in Taiwan. These tests are important in helping us to detect as many cases as possible and as early as possible.The moment a case is confirmed, we activate contact tracing to identify close contacts and quarantine them as soon as possible, so as to reduce further spread of the disease.The Government has put in place many measures to reduce imported cases, and to trace and isolate any such cases as soon as possible to prevent spread. But every one of us needs to play our part in practising good personal hygiene, social responsibility and safe distancing to further reduce the risk of local transmission. We announced several safe distancing measures yesterday. Minister Lawrence Wong will elaborate on these later. I hope that Singaporeans will support these measures and keep up good hygiene habits which will play an increasingly important role in our fight against COVID-19.During theCOSdebate, I mentioned Singapore's efforts in developing research and knowledge on COVID-19 and sharing these with other countries. There is an article today in today's paper about an innovative rapid test kit being developed by A*STAR's researchers. We hope they will go to trial soon and give us an additional weaponry against COVID-19.For treatment, a COVID-19 therapeutic workgroup comprising members from various hospitals across different disciplines as well as Health Sciences Authority or HSA, has been set up to work on guidelines for repurposed drugs with antiviral activity, such as Lopinavir-ritonavir, Interferon Beta-1B and hydroxychloroquine, to treat infected patients in Singapore.The National Centre for Infectious Diseases or NCID, and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, together with Singapore Blood Blank, have initiated donor recruitment to collect convalescent blood plasma from recovered patients to treat other COVID-19 patients. Our doctors have also been participating in international clinical trials, with collaborators such as the US National Institutes of Health.For vaccines, scientists all over the world have successfully isolated and cultured the virus, which will aid the development of a vaccine. The international community is also working together to identify vaccine candidates and conduct clinical trials. For example, some institutes such as Moderna Inc have already started human trials as of last week. In Singapore, Duke-NUS Medical School is working with Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations or CEPI, and international partners to develop a clinical trial for a vaccine, with plans to start testing sometime this year. With all these on-going efforts, WHO estimates that the earliest a vaccine will be ready would likely be sometime next year.We do not know how long the pandemic will last, but we have to plan on the basis that COVID-19 will be with us for a long while, maybe till the end of the year or longer and ensure that we have the resources and capabilities to see us through. COVID-19 has also taken a toll on our economy. The impact will extend way beyond the pandemic. Many Singaporeans and businesses will need to make adjustments as this is not something that will be over quickly. The measures we announced yesterday will impact many businesses and workers. The Government will introduce greater support for the economy and our workers in response to this situation.Members of Parliament have asked about healthcare capacity. We will ensure that we have sufficient capacity to meet our healthcare needs not only for COVID-19 patients but also for other patients.We had invested significantly in the past to ensure that we have sufficient healthcare capacity to manage infectious outbreaks. The 330-bed NCID was purpose-built with spare capacity and can be further increased to over 500 beds if need be.To preserve capacity and resources for those who most need it, clinicians at our public hospitals had earlier reviewed their patients and deferred non-urgent appointments and elective procedures where clinically appropriate to do so. They have continued to see patients with higher needs to ensure that they receive timely care. When appointments had to be deferred, the public hospitals have worked to ensure that patients received sufficient supportive care.We are also exploring collaborations with private hospitals for some non-COVID-19 patients to be cared for there instead. We already have on-going collaborations with some of them and some of these can be stepped up so that we can preserve capacity in our public hospitals to manage the outbreak. Patients transferred to these private hospitals through such collaborations will continue to pay similar rates they would have paid at our public hospitals.The most important resource, actually, is our healthcare staff. They have been working tirelessly to make sure that our patients, COVID-19 or otherwise, are well taken care of. I want to take this opportunity to thank our healthcare workers once again for their dedication. [Applause.]We recognise the heavy workload and stress that our healthcare workers face every day. The surge in patient load due to COVID-19 means that some are taking on longer shifts, while others are required to take on additional roles. To ensure the well-being of our healthcare workers, institutions will make sure that their staff are well-rested and have put in place a series of measures to reduce staff burnout, such as counselling services and peer support programmes.Most importantly, every case we can avoid will help to lighten their load. Hence, each of us can help by doing the right thing to reduce the risk of transmission.I also want to also thank Singaporeans for your resilience, your understanding and support in adapting to these new measures and changes quickly and putting up with inconveniences and disruptions to your daily lives for the sake of other Singaporeans and our community. With the global situation still evolving and the number of cases rising rapidly worldwide, we must prepare to see more cases here too in time to come. Yesterday, we had 17 local cases in addition to 32 imported ones. We must work together and do what we can to keep the number of local cases down.With a significant number of imported cases from returning residents and visitors, we have progressively put in place travel restrictions and placed returning residents on the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and quarantine, but there is still a risk of them leading to more localised transmissions.As more clusters emerge, our contact tracing, quarantine and healthcare resources will be stretched. If the clusters grow too large, such as those we see in the Life Church and Missions and Grace Assembly of God or SAFRA Jurong, if we have a few of them at the same time, it will be very difficult to contain them effectively, and the pressure on our healthcare system will increase. While we still have sufficient capacity in our healthcare system today, we cannot be complacent and we will need to preserve our buffer capacity.Previously, all confirmed COVID-19 cases, regardless of severity, were admitted to our hospitals and remained there until they were tested negative for the virus twice, over a period of 24 hours, and this takes up our capacity. We took this conservative approach earlier on in this epidemic, as there was little knowledge about the severity of the disease and we wanted to find out more.However, we now know that about 80% of COVID-19 cases were mild to moderate. That means many of the COVID-19 cases in our hospitals experience mild symptoms, no more than that of flu. They only require limited medical care and what we need really are isolation facilities to prevent them from infecting others, until they are free of the virus.Therefore, MOH is tapping on private capacity and setting up community care facilities, such as the collaboration with Concord International Hospital which started accepting well and stable COVID-19 patients last Friday and Mount Elizabeth Hospital which saw its first patient on Monday. We are also converting some Government Quarantine Facilities, starting with D’Resort with a maximum capacity of about 500, for this purpose. As per public hospitals, Singaporean residents and long-term pass holders transferred to these facilities will continue to receive free-of-charge testing and treatment, except for those who have travelled overseas despite the travel advisory and contracted the infection while overseas.Patients at these facilities will continue to be quarantined and closely monitored, so there is no risk to the general public in the community. Similar to cases admitted to hospitals, patients will be closely monitored and repeatedly tested for the virus.Only when they have fully recovered and tested negative for the virus twice over a duration of 24 hours, will they be discharged back into the community. At this point, they will no longer have any risk of transmitting the virus to others as they have fully recovered. We will continue to explore the use of such isolation facilities for our well and stable COVID-19 patients. This way, we can focus our critical hospital resources on the seriously ill, to minimise the number of fatalities. But rest assured that any Singaporean who requires medical care, whether for COVID-19 or other illnesses, will receive the necessary treatment and care.Let me take this opportunity to explain our strategy going forward and share what we can expect.While we implement plans to ensure sufficient healthcare capacity, it is equally important to prevent new local clusters in the first place. This way, we can try to avoid an exponential growth in the number of infections, which could quickly overwhelm the healthcare system, as we saw in Hubei and Italy; and increasingly so, in many other countries.Singapore's strategy is to slow down the infection rate and maintain it at as low a level for as long as possible. A lower infection rate will help us to better conduct epidemiological investigations, contact tracing and quarantining of close contacts, so as to prevent further spread of the disease in the community. It also preserves healthcare capacity to care for the more severe cases. With your permission, Mr Speaker, may I display a slide on the LCD screen to illustrate this point?Mr Speaker: Yes, please. [A slide was shown to hon Members. Please refer toAnnex 1.]Mr Gan Kim Yong: Thank you, Mr Speaker. If we do nothing, the number of cases will shoot up, like what happened in several cities and countries recently. Then, our only hope is that most of the population get infected and become immune quickly, and the rate of infection will start to slow down as more become immune, or a vaccine or a cure is found. That is when the curve starts to trend downwards.This scenario is very attractive, we get over with it very quickly, but there are unfortunately, two major risks. First, an uncontrolled spike in the number of cases in a short period of time, like the purple curve, will overwhelm the healthcare system, easily resulting in high mortality rates, and there is no turning back once you are on this track. The second risk is that it is not certain yet that this immunity will be effective or sustained.So, one alternative, is to introduce stringent safe distancing and other measures to slow down the infection curve, to slow down the infection rate. The number will still grow but if we do it right, we will end up with a lower peak. This is commonly known as flattening the curve, as Members can see, on the blue curve.But by flattening the curve, we may actually stretch out the pandemic. So, Members see a long tail, meaning it will take much longer for the pandemic to be over. So, for Singapore, today, we are still at the start of the curve, so we have a chance, we have a chance to do neither. We hope, that if we do it right, we can significantly slow down the growth as much as we can, until the whole pandemic is over, without either a sharp peak or a long tail. This may sound impossible, because this are the two curves that have been established by academics. But, impossible as it may sound, we have to try our best to do so.To achieve this, we have to continue to strengthen our efforts to detect cases early to initiate the contact tracing process as soon as possible to reduce the risk of the infection spreading. In preparation for the expected surge in cases in the coming weeks, we have expanded our contact tracing capacity, from three teams when we started out, to 20 teams today, thanks to manpower support from colleagues from Public Service agencies, including the SAF. We can now trace up to 4,000 contacts each day and will continue to scale up our contact tracing capacity as needed.We are also leveraging technology to supplement our contact tracing efforts. For example, last week, MOH and GovTech launched the TraceTogether app, which will capture data on whom you have come into contact with for some time. This will be useful if you have come into close contact with a confirmed case which you do not know.By downloading and activating this app, the contact tracers will be able to inform you early so that you can isolate yourself and protect your family, or receive early treatment if you are already unwell. For those who are concerned about privacy, I would like to assure you that the app does not track your location, so where you go, does not matter, the app does not know. It uses Bluetooth to detect if you have been in close proximity for more than 30 minutes with someone else with the app switched on. I urge Members and all Singaporeans to download the app to protect yourselves and your families.I have spoken multiple times about the importance of social responsibility, here in Parliament as well as publicly. The Government will continue to put in place measures to protect Singaporeans as I have shared earlier, but the daily actions of each one of us will go a long way in winning this war. If you have been issued with a quarantine order or Stay-Home Notice, please stay at home and abide by the requirements of the order or notice. If you violate them, there will be penalties and the heaviest penalty is that you may infect others, including those you love. If you are unwell, please wear a mask and see a doctor immediately. If you have been given a medical certificate, please stay home for the whole duration covered by the medical certificate. Wash your hands with soap regularly and do not touch your face. It is literally in our hands to contain this outbreak.In Singapore, we saw a few local clusters emerge where individuals who were feeling unwell or were issued a Medical Certificate but did not minimise social contact and continued to attend work or social activities. We have encouraged employers to support employees to spend the necessary time away from the office so that they can recover.Studies on COVID-19 have shown that for each ill person who behaves responsibly, we can protect two to three others from being infected. It is not just about ourselves, but those around us too, including our loved ones. For the young and healthy among us, we may get away with a mild cold or cough, but for the more vulnerable loved ones around us, the disease may prove to be more serious. So, we must not take social responsibility lightly.We have been progressively putting in place safe distancing measures, especially for the vulnerable groups. For example, after the SAFRA Jurong cluster arose, we suspended all senior-activities at Community Centres, Residents Committees, Senior Activity Centres and others. While some Members of Parliament, I think, Ms Denise Phua, asked me at the last Sitting whether we can resume some of these activities, I was very happy to say yes, then. Now, I am afraid it will be a while longer before we do that, to protect the seniors.Seniors are of particular concern to us. MOH introduced an enhanced set of measures last week together with a set of guidelines to protect our seniors. We encourage seniors to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene like everyone else and engage in more home-based activities rather than joining group activities. For example, they can exercise at home with TV and online exercise programmes, as well as enjoy broadcast programmes covering singing, so they do not need to join karaoke groups, but they can join TV programmes and sing-along; cooking and other programmes by celebrities and People's Association trainers.Do not go out except for essential activities such as work or to buy food and supplies. Family members and care-givers of seniors should also take precautions such as washing hands with soap and water before interacting with seniors and refraining from visiting seniors if one is unwell.Each of us needs to play our part to take care of our seniors. With these added precautions in place, seniors can continue staying active and healthy.The measures we have put in place are extra \"brakes\" to slow down the transmission of the virus, prevent our healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed, help bring the number of cases back down over time, and protect, particularly, our seniors.Sir, let me conclude. While we should keep a wider physical distance between ourselves and others, we need to close the emotional distance between us. As Prime Minister pointed out, this is as much a psychological battle as it is a medical one. To win the battle, we must close ranks while keeping a safe physical distance. We should not stop caring about fellow Singaporeans or build walls between ourselves. On the contrary, we need to be more united than ever so that we can ride through this crisis together. We can show our appreciation to our frontline workers who are working very hard to keep Singapore clean and Singaporeans safe, and show our support to colleagues and friends who have acted responsibly and isolated themselves when they feel unwell.The months ahead will be challenging. We need to be prepared for disruptions to our daily lives and changes to how we do things. But I am confident that if we stay united, with a whole-of-society effort, we can get through this together as a nation – SG United. [Applause.]Mr Speaker: The Minister for National Development will be making a related Ministerial Statement. I will allow Members raise points of clarifications on both statements after this statement. Minister Wong.2.26 pmThe Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Health has given an update on the global and local situation and explained the public health measures that we have taken so far, as well as how we are managing our healthcare capacity. Let me now elaborate on the other aspects of the work of the Ministerial task force.As Minister Gan mentioned just now, we experienced an initial wave of imported cases from China, which resulted in some local transmission and local clusters. Now, we are facing a second and much bigger wave of imported cases from the rest of the world, especially from America and Europe. It reflects how quickly virus is spreading around the world outside of China. The number of cases is doubling every four to six days. There are more cases outside China than in China now.We are not alone in facing this new wave of imported cases. Many places in Asia – Hong Kong, Taiwan are in a similar situation. That is why we have been rapidly adjusting and updating our measures to respond to this new challenge.We have progressively tightened our border controls and travel restrictions, based on the rapidly changing situation. We started with restrictions, as Members would recall, for travellers from China; we extended the restrictions to other epidemic centres – initially to Republic of Korea, Italy, Iran, then France, Germany, Spain; and later UK, Switzerland, Japan and the ASEAN countries. Eventually, we did not have to do country by country, we covered the whole world.Earlier this week, we decided to disallow short-term visitors from entering or transiting in Singapore and to limit returning work pass holders to only those providing essential services like healthcare and transport. These are very significant moves for a small open economy like Singapore, where we have always been connected to the world. But these are extraordinary times, this is an unprecedented crisis and we had to move decisively to keep our borders safe.Importantly, we want to focus our resources on the large number of returning Singaporeans coming back from overseas. We identify those coming back with symptoms as early as possible, right at the airport. We are testing as many as possible and we are expanding our testing capacity. But the numbers are large. Just from UK and US alone, we are getting about 1,200 Singaporeans coming back every day. Every day.We also know that we cannot rely on tests alone, because someone who tests negative at the point of entry may simply be incubating the virus and could develop symptoms over the following days. That is why it is important to also isolate these returnees and have all of them have to serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice. They have to stay at their place of residence and avoid contact with others even within the same household.We now have 38,000 residents on Stay-Home Notices. That is a very large number. And the numbers will rise with the growing number of returnees.Many are understandably concerned about the risk of the Stay-Home Notice returnees infecting their family members. So, we have just tightened the regime with additional precautions. We are focusing on returnees from the US and UK, given the higher risks, and we are now arranging for them to be transported from the airport directly to designated hotels to serve out the 14-day self-isolation period. These returnees have to stay in their rooms throughout. They cannot use any of the hotel facilities, swimming pool or gym; fourteen days in the room and we will put in place tight security arrangements to ensure this. For those who have already returned and are presently still serving the Stay-Home Notices at home, they, too, can apply to stay in these designated hotels if they so prefer.This is a huge operational and logistical undertaking, given the volumes of people we are receiving everyday. We are able to make use of the empty bed spaces in hotels but we still need to ramp up manpower to enforce their self-isolation. And I want to acknowledge the hard work of all our public officials who did an excellent job in getting this ready within a very short period of time.There is no telling how long this current wave of returnees and imported cases will last. There are more than 200,000 Singaporeans overseas. With more lockdowns imposed in countries elsewhere, more may want to return here to Singapore. And we should welcome them. So, we have to be prepared for more returnees and have arrangements to ensure that they are self-isolated for the full period before they can be brought back within our community.At the same time, we do not want Singaporeans to travel overseas at this time and to compound the problem. That is why we have raised our travel advisory to the highest level to defer all travel. Previously, it was \"non-essential\". But I think people regard many things as essential. So, we say now \"defer all travel\". Those who choose to do so will have to pay fullcosts should they need treatment for COVID-19 when they return. Likewise, they will be subject to a full 14-day self-isolation at the hotel which they will also have to pay in full.Despite our best efforts at controlling these flows at the borders, we have to be prepared for more cases to emerge, especially given the large number of returnees. That is why it is critical to quickly identify and isolate these cases and their close contacts through our on-going efforts at contact tracing and quarantine. Minister Gan spoke about this and how we are going to ramp up our capacity to do more contact tracing. This is essential because the minute you give up on contact tracing, then you are no longer able to manage the virus outbreak. This is the situation that many countries are facing now – they are no longer able to contact-trace the cases as well as their close contacts. So, we want to continue to maintain contact tracing and put all the close contacts under quarantine.As of last night, there are around 2,500 persons under quarantine, be it in their homes or in Government Quarantine Facilities. The numbers give you a sense of proportion. We are talking about 38,000 Stay-Home Notices because of the large volume of returnees. But within Singapore, the close contacts, we have 2,500 under quarantine.We will continue with the tough enforcement for both Stay-Home Notice and quarantine cases, including through all the various means we have put in place –remote monitoring, video calls and random house visits. We have put in place also very strict penalties for those who breach the requirements. They can be fined up to $10,000 or jailed for up to six months, or both. But as Minister Gan said just now, the biggest penalty is not just a fine or even a jail sentence but thecosts that you impose on others if you were to breach these rules.We have an excellent detection system to pick up COVID-19 cases through our contact tracing procedures. One Harvard study called our contact tracing system the \"gold standard\". But even then, our detection rate is not 100%. It will never be. No system can be 100%. That means that the virus continues to circulate in our population and there are still cases out there in the community which will pop up.That is our greater concern. We monitor very closely the number of locally-transmitted cases, especially the ones that are unlinked – \"unlinked\" meaning that they are new, they are popping up and we do not know where they originate from. We are seeing more of such cases in recent days. That is why we need to put in place a whole range of additional public health measures to slow down the spread of the virus within Singapore itself. We can think of these additional public health measures at different levels.First, we have baseline measures which we are already doing. What is \"baseline\"? Things like daily temperature taking, seeing a doctor if you are unwell and staying at home and not shaking hands. Now, in true multiracial Singapore style, we have different ways of doing it. You can do the “Salam Mufti”, traditional Chinese style or Namaste. I think all of us are practising this in our daily lives now. We uphold good personal hygiene; wash our hands regularly and do not use our hands to touch our face and we uphold better public hygiene standards. We are stepping this up through SG Clean, a whole-of-nation effort that Minister Masagos is overseeing.All of these measures should be continued for a sustained period. In fact, some ought to be new permanent norms, like upholding higher hygiene standards and using common serving utensils instead of double dipping. So, even after the COVID-19 outbreak is over – and it will be over after a while – we should continue to practise some of these new norms as a permanent part of our lives. I am not sure about the not-shaking-hands part. Frankly, at some point in time, we might want to get back to having some physical contact, but certainly not now. So, many things we will do on a sustained basis, some on a permanent basis even.But beyond the baseline measures, we need to rely on additional measures and that is what we call social or safe distancing. We can think of these measures as extra \"brakes\" that we apply to slow down the spread of the virus. Last Friday, we introduced a first set of safe distancing measures. We suspended senior group activities; we pushed for telecommuting and staggered hours at workplaces; we limited large events to less than 250 persons, and we said seats have to be apart, like what we are doing now in Parliament; and we wanted a 1-metre spacing in public spaces and F&B outlets.These measures are progressively being implemented. For example, public sector agencies are now pushing very hard on telecommuting. Where it is not possible, for example, for frontline and operational units, the agencies have implemented split teams by location or shifts, as well as staggered work hours, wherever it is practical. But the efforts on telecommuting must go beyond the public sector.All workplaces must go on telecommuting as default wherever they can. More employers are doing this, but some are still resistant and want their staff to be physically present in their offices when they can actually work from home. So, we will get all employers to push more aggressively on telecommuting. This is the only way to allow Singaporeans to continue working while minimising their movements and contacts outside and it is also how we can reduce the load on our public transport system, especially during peak hours.The measures introduced last week have brought about changes. There are fewer crowded venues. When you go out, you can see that perceptibly. We now see alternate seats marked in dining venues, including in hawker centres and coffee shops. So, people are seated further apart.But we have to move faster, much faster. We still hear anecdotes of people going to discosand night clubs, and gathering in large groups. Our big worry is that these can become super-spreader events, spawning new clusters and potential runaway outbreaks. That is why we have proceeded with another set of brakes yesterday – even tighter safe distancing measures with the aim of limiting gatherings outside of work and school to less than 10 persons.Let me explain briefly the rationale for making these moves. In schools and workplaces, we have been taking precautions. For schools, for example, Minister Ong Ye Kung and the MOE team have put in place a range of measures to keep students safe. They sit further apart in classrooms. CCA activities and inter-school activities are suspended. So, we do not allow intermingling of students outside of the classroom.In workplaces, too, we are getting employers to take precautions, getting their staff to be seated separately and, as I have mentioned earlier, pushing harder on telecommuting.But outside of schools and workplaces, we continue to see many gatherings of people and that is what we want to minimise. That is why we are suspending all entertainment venues like bars, clubs and cinemas. We are suspending religious congregations and services. We are suspending tuition centres. Even though the numbers may be small, but children coming to these centres come from different schools and they intermingle. So, we are suspending that. We are cancelling and deferring all events and mass gatherings and we are putting restrictions on retail malls, museums and attractions where they have to reduce the density of people moving in these areas and ensure no coming together of groups of more than 10 persons. These measures will take effect from Thursday, 2359 hours, and will be in place for at least a month until the end of April, that is, two incubation cycles.With this significant slowing down of activities and movements, we hope we can break the potential transmission chains that may be happening. These are very major moves to slow down the spread of the virus. We recognise the inconvenience and disruption that these measures will bring to people’s lives and to businesses, but we have no easy options. That is the reality that countries everywhere are facing in tackling the virus. The more we try to stop or slow down the virus, the steeper will be the damage on our economies. So, we have to do what is necessary from the public health point of view first to save lives, slow down the virus and then, thereafter, do our best to manage the economic consequences. In the last few days, even as the Task force was deliberating over these measures, we have been sharing them, updating the MOF and economic teams working on the package of measures which Deputy Prime Minister Heng will be announcing tomorrow.So, I urge all Singaporeans to cooperate and take the latest set of measures very seriously. Our main message to everyone is this: minimise your non-essential activities and your contact with others during this period. You can talk about all the suspensions, different settings, but simple message – everyone minimise your non-essential activities and your contact with others during this period. We must all do our part to stop the spread of the disease and ensure that we do not end up with a major outbreak of new local clusters.Mr Speaker, Sir, we are now at a critical phase in our fight against the virus. The latest measures may help to slow down the spread of the virus. But it is also possible that despite these measures, the number of infected cases will continue to rise. If so, we will need more drastic measures and that would include suspending of schools and closure of some workplaces, aside from those providing essential services.So, we will keep the measures under constant review. If the situation worsens, we will apply extra brakes. If the situation improves, we may be able to ease off a little bit but not go back to baseline; perhaps to a less stringent set of measures because the pandemic will probably still not be over for quite some time.Given that we have been tightening our measures recently, I can understand why Singaporeans may also be concerned about the availability of essential supplies. In fact, we have been planning for potential disruption of supplies, be it food or medical supplies, over many years through stockpiling, local production and diversification of our overseas sources. Minister Chan Chun Sing and the MTI team are overseeing this work and they have been steadily ramping up their efforts across all fronts.Here, too, we need Singaporeans to cooperate. If many people start to build up their own individual stockpiles at home unnecessarily, it will lead to an apparent shortage on the supermarket shelves and deprive others who may have more urgent need for food and other essential supplies. Such a perception could precipitate more panic buying, which can quickly spiral out of control.There was, indeed, some concern initially when Malaysia imposed a Movement Control Order earlier this month. But the situation has now stabilised. The flow of goods and cargo, including food supplies, are largely continuing although we still have to be prepared there may well be disruptions along the way. As far as people movement is concerned, we have quickly found accommodations for the Malaysian workers who decided to stay in Singapore and this has allowed essential services like public transport to continue without interruption.Going forward, the Singapore-Malaysia Special Working Committee, co-chaired by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean and Senior Minister Dato Sri' Ismail Sabri on the Malaysian side, is discussing a joint mitigation plan to ensure the safe and sustainable movement of people, goods and essential services between our two countries. In fact, if you have been following the news, Malaysia has now just extend its movement restrictions to 14 April, a few more weeks.If and when the Movement Control Order in Malaysia is lifted, we cannot go back to business as usual and have large groups of people moving across our land checkpoints on a daily basis. That will be too dangerous from a public health point of view. So, we will need extra precautions on both sides, which are being worked out, so as to minimise the spread of the virus across our land borders.Mr Speaker, I have summarised some of our key strategies in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.Underpinning all of these efforts is the need for all Singaporeans to take individual and social responsibility. The fight against the virus cannot be done by frontline workers or Government agencies alone. Each and every one of us has to actively do our part. And there are many things that we all can do, which Minister Gan mentioned earlier: upholding good personal hygiene; taking of temperature daily; seeing a doctor if you are unwell; staying at home if that is the case; and if you have just returned from overseas, ensure you self-isolate for 14 days, even from your family members; and minimising of non-essential activities and contact with others during this period. All of these measures we will try to enforce but ultimately it is about individual responsibility, individual actions to comply with these guidelines.We are all enlisted in this national effort to slow down the spread of the virus and if we are disciplined about this, we will have a chance to control the situation and to protect ourselves, our family members, and the people around us.In these difficult times, we see the best of Singapore and Singaporeans at work. We had young people from the Youth Corps conducting door-to-door visits to share personal hygiene and safety tips with the elderly. We have had many volunteer groups like the Singapore Red Cross stepping up their befriending calls to many isolated seniors. We had many individuals and volunteers also packing and donating care packs and items like masks, hand sanitisers and thermometers to the elderly and vulnerable groups.In these difficult times, we see Singaporeans from all walks of life working flat out to fight the virus.We have healthcare workers on the frontline making many sacrifices and working tirelessly to care for patients.We have our public officials working very hard, too, across all the agencies – not everything they do is visible to the public eye. But I can tell you that they are working round the clock and it is incredible what they have been able to achieve, especially given the quick turnaround times. We are literally making new measures every other day, putting in place adjustments to measures almost on a daily basis and so this impacts on communications. We have a huge team working night and day to put out public communications materials to inform the public of all of these updates. We have a huge team on the operational side, be it at immigration or security, going all out to adjust to these changes and ensuring smooth implementation.From time to time, there will be public feedback, there will be public complaints – they take all of this in their stride. If there are lapses, they try to rectify them as quickly as possible. And I hope the public will cooperate, too. We welcome feedback but you can do your part by ensuring the accuracy of your feedback so that the agencies do not have to waste time and resources to check on each and every information.There are many more unsung heroes all over the island – in areas like cleaning, security, airport management, media, hotels, F&B, transport and many more providing services to Singaporeans – all still going strong, keeping their spirits high.And there are many Singaporeans who have stepped up in their own ways looking after one another and caring for our fellow Singaporeans. Words are not sufficient to express our appreciation. Mr Speaker, words are not sufficient to express our appreciation for all of those who are —Please give me a minute.Let me just repeat what I said just now. Words are not sufficient to express our appreciation for so many Singaporeans going all out to fight the virus. And I just want to say a big \"thank you\" to everyone who is doing their part. [Applause]We recognise that there is a growing uncertainty, anxiety and fear amongst Singaporeans. People are asking many questions – how long will this last? How safe will we be? How will our businesses survive? I receive many suggestions and feedback all the time, every day. Some want more drastic measures. Some say we are doing too much and there are too many restrictions. I appreciate all of the feedback. I cannot reply to each one of them, individually, but the team is looking at all of them and we take all of them into consideration as we develop and update our measures.In some cases, there are no clear answers and solutions because the situation is so uncertain – so fluid and changing rapidly by the day. But one thing is clear – we are all in this together and we will continue to work through the challenges together, every step of the way.Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been more than two months since our work on COVID-19 started. It almost seems like a life time ago, but in fact, we are only at the beginning of a very long fight. This will continue for many more months till the end of the year and, perhaps, even beyond.The coronavirus is, without a doubt, the biggest threat the world and Singapore has faced for decades. So, let us rally together and rise to this challenge because as SG United, we can beat the virus together and we will emerge stronger and toughened after this crisis. [Applause.]Mr Speaker: Points of clarifications. Mr Christopher de Souza.2.55 pmMr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah): Sir, I thank the Ministers for their heartfelt statements. It looks to be obvious – the COVID-19 outbreak will be long drawn. Singapore's next General Election must be held by April 2021. However, Dr Tan Cheng Bock has suggested that the President can exercise her soft power and form a caretaker government with some of the current Members of Parliament. Then, Dr Tan says, call fresh elections when COVID is no longer a crisis.In my view, having a caretaker government is not an answer to the long drawn crisis.So, my question is: from the standpoint of the Constitution, what is the Government's position on such a caretaker proposal?I have a second question: should the GE be held while COVID-19 is still in Singapore, what measures can be put in place to ensure the safety of Singaporeans during the election?Mr Gan Kim Yong: Sir, the terms of reference of the Ministerial task force does not include consideration of the General Election. Perhaps, I can invite Senior Minister Teo to speak on this topic.Mr Speaker: Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean.The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Teo Chee Hean): Mr Speaker, Sir, we have just heard from Minister Gan and Minister Lawrence Wong on what the situation is. It is a global pandemic and an unprecedented global crisis. It is a difficult time for everyone. In Europe and the US, the virus is still spreading at an exponential rate.We have twin crises: health and economic. A global recession is imminent. Financial markets are in their worst turmoil since 2008. Hence, on 14 March, Prime Minister Lee warned that we face a grave and extended challenge. The pandemic “is likely to last at least this year, and quite possibly longer”. Even after we deal with this pandemic, the economic repercussion will last longer, with significant and longstanding impact on both lives and livelihoods.In Singapore, the Government took early and decisive action to protect our people. We have managed the COVID-19 situation for now, with tremendous effort and cooperation from everyone. But the situation remains very serious and continues to develop quickly. We are starting to see another wave of imported cases – mainly from returning Singaporeans. The Multi-Ministry Task Force has introduced measures to deal with this. But the situation may get worse, before it eventually gets better.Our focus now, of this Government, is on being prepared for the long haul, through the end of this year and beyond, and focus on solving this problem with Singaporeans and for Singapore.Mr Speaker, the term of the 13th Parliament will end on 14 January 2021. An election must be held within three months of that, which means on or before 14 April 2021.Ideally, we would like to conduct elections in normal conditions. The present situation is not ideal for holding an election, but that does not mean it makes an election impossible.As the Prime Minister said, no decision has been taken yet on the timing of a GE. In making such a decision, the overriding concern is what is best for Singapore and for Singaporeans.Some have suggested only holding elections when we see the \"tail-end of the virus spread\". And this is, indeed, the dilemma that we face. The Prime Minister has laid out the choices clearly. We can hope and pray that things stabilise, but we do not know when the COVID-19 situation will stabilise – whether it will do so within the next year, by January, or by April 2021. But what we do know is that an election must be held, must take place by 14 April 2021.The longer we wait, the more unpredictable, difficult and dangerous it could be. Compounding this will be the uncertainty that comes with when the election will be held as we go through the year, trying to face this crisis together.Alternatively, the country can go for early elections, settle who will lead the country through this major crisis, and give the Government a clear and fresh mandate, a full term ahead and legitimacy to take major decisions, tough decisions in the interest of Singaporeans.Today, more than ever, we need a government that the people has expressed confidence in, to take us through this unprecedented health crisis, stabilise the economy and safeguard our people's lives and livelihood.Mr Speaker, Sir, when you are sailing into a storm, you want to be certain who your captain is and that he will not be changed halfway. You want to make sure that he is there together with you, working with you, guiding you through the storm.It is not a good idea to place all our hopes in the situation improving before April 2021, and add the uncertainty of when an election will be held to the uncertainties that are already ahead of us. However, we should not close off any options.We have been upfront and open with Singaporeans about the challenges we face, the dilemmas, considerations and different possibilities so that Singaporeans will understand why there might be a need to go ahead.However, some suggestions about this issue have been misleading and unhelpful. For example, the suggestion to delay the elections beyond the required time-frame of April 2021 until the crisis is over and to have the President form a caretaker government consisting of some of the current Members of Parliament.Mr Speaker, Sir, I have sought the advice of the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) on whether this can be done. The advice of the AGC is that to delay an election beyond the required date in such a manner is unconstitutional. The only circumstances when the election can be put off beyond the required date is when a state of emergency is declared.Mr Speaker, Sir, although Singapore has weathered many crises since our Independence, we have never extended a Government's term beyond the constitutional limit. Singapore is one of the only newly independent Commonwealth countries to regularly hold elections and has never declared a state of emergency since 1965.Declaring an emergency and putting off elections indefinitely is not a precedent we should set lightly. A President's power to declare an emergency can only be exercised on the advice of the Cabinet. Even if the President proclaims an emergency, given that the incumbent Cabinet remains in office during an emergency, there is no legal basis or practical need for the President to form a new government.Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not helpful to mislead people into thinking that such an option exists to put off elections indefinitely and for the President to form a new government when this goes against the Constitution.Even if there is a caretaker government under a state of emergency, it would by definition be a caretaker. It would be hobbled by the fact that it lacks the explicit mandate of voters and would therefore not be in a position to take major decisions on behalf of Singaporeans. This is the reason why constitutional convention requires that a caretaker government not make any far-reaching or long-term measure.So, this is the fundamental problem. Just when we need a government with a clear mandate to pull out all the stops in a crisis to implement strong mitigation measures, to mobilise our resources and reserves to implement strong economic stabilisation measures to save jobs and livelihoods, and to steer the country through the COVID-19 crisis, a caretaker government would not have a mandate to do so.How can this be in the best interests of the country and our people?Sir, to suggest this shows a disregard for or lack of understanding of the Constitution. Putting forward constitutionally unworkable proposals at a time of serious national crisis can only confuse and mislead Singaporeans, to the detriment of Singapore and Singaporeans.This discussion on the impact of COVID-19 on our elections is an important one. It goes to a matter of principle.This Government is ever mindful that what is at stake are jobs, businesses and lives. Our decision must be based on what is in the best interests of Singapore and Singaporeans, and how we can move forward together.On Mr Christopher de Souza's second question – he asked about holding elections safely amidst the COVID-19 outbreak.The safety of all Singaporeans is of utmost importance. To combat the virus spread, we have implemented comprehensive measures over the past few weeks at every level. We have heard Minister Gan and Minister Wong – travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing measures, strengthening our healthcare institutions, workplace measures, protecting our students in schools and supply of essential goods. Even if the election takes place, it will not disrupt any of this. All these necessary measures will still be maintained.But COVID-19 has created a new normal. Whether elections are held early or later, we will still have to work on the basis that the next election will necessarily be different from past elections. This means that the necessary extra safeguards and precautions must and will be taken, whether the elections are held early or held later, at every step – nominations, campaigning and voting. We will have to make all the necessary arrangements to ensure that parties can campaign effectively and people can vote safely. For example, for campaigning, we can have live-streaming of speeches on the Internet and adequate television time for candidates. For voting, we already have special express lanes for seniors and those who need them. We can also have social distancing while queuing, proper hand hygiene for voting paraphernalia and hand sanitisers for voters. We will learn from the experiences of other countries that are holding elections even during this on-going COVID-19 outbreak.All these measures and precautions are required to protect Singaporeans. Whatever measures taken will affect all political parties equally.As the Prime Minister said, no decision has been taken yet on the timing of the General Elections, but we have to plan on taking such additional measures to safeguard the health of Singaporeans. And I stress that these precautions and measures will be needed whether the election is held early or later. Thank you, Mr Speaker.Mr Speaker: Er Dr Lee Bee WahEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon): Thank you, Sir. I have one clarification. I think most Singaporeans are following the Government's advice very closely. However, there may be a small group of Singaporeans who disregard the Stay-Home Notice. Instead of staying home, what we learn from some of the chat groups, is that those who returned went out clubbing. So, my question is, how do we deal with those who fail to comply with the Stay-Home Notice.Mr Gan Kim Yong: Thank you. This is a very important question and it is an issue that we are addressing and that we are paying a lot of attention to. For the enforcement of the Stay-Home Notice, we have help from the Home Team, so may I ask the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr K Shanmugam to respond.Mr Speaker: Mr K Shanmugam.The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam): Mr Speaker, Sir, the stay-at-home framework was first issued to persons who were returning from specified countries, countries that we thought were higher risk. But since then, of course, the COVID-19 situation across the world has grown considerably worse.So, on 22 March, we announced that all short-term visitors will not be allowed to enter into Singapore or transit through Singapore. So, in other words, no more tourists. No short stays. Singapore residents and long-term pass holders, they will obviously come back and they will be placed under a Stay-Home Notice (SHN) from 23 March.And it works this way: it means that Singaporeans will not be stranded overseas. They can come back. They can get access to our healthcare system. But those who are served with an SHN also have a responsibility. They should not put the wider community at risk.A Stay-Home Notice means exactly that – they have to remain in their place of residence at all times during the 14-day period and that is a non-negotiable condition. Persons on SHN are required to monitor their health closely. They have to minimise contact with others, even at home. They have to avoid having visitors. They cannot leave the house and they have to seek immediate medical attention if feeling unwell.This is because persons under SHN carry some risk of having the virus by virtue of their travel history or by virtue of their contact with others who may have had COVID-19.To ensure compliance with SHN, we conduct enforcement checks. They include surveillance using SMS, web-based solutions, mobile applications; and people are expected to be at home and contactable, obviously. Those who do not respond to the messages will be called and there are also house visits, unannounced, by enforcement officers.There are serious consequences for non-compliance. You have section 21(a) of the Infectious Diseases Act (IDA). If you breach the SHN, that could expose others to risk of infection, a first-time offender could face a jail term of up to six months, a fine of $10,000, of both. For repeat offenders, they face a jail term of up to 12 months, a fine of $20,000, or both.MOH will be setting out new regulations under the IDA, specifically focusing on penalties for SHN breaches. The jail term could be up to six months, a $10,000 fine, or both. If you are not a Singapore Citizen, but you are a Permanent Resident, a long-term visit pass holder, a dependent pass holder, a student pass holder, where appropriate, we will not hesitate to revoke these passes, shorten their validity and also bar re-entry into Singapore. So, the passes could be cancelled if you are short-term visitors and you could be asked to leave Singapore immediately and barred from re-entry forever.Foreign employees could have their work passes revoked and repatriated. For students, action can be taken by schools, including suspension or dismissal.Where there has a breach of the SHN and we knew about it, action had been taken. Members may recall when the SHNs were first introduced. There was a 45-year-old Permanent Resident, he was served with such a notice. He arrived at Changi Airport. He had a travel history to mainland China at that point, failed to respond to our calls. When enforcement checks were done, he was not at home and then, he was seen at Changi Airport, wanting to leave Singapore. It is clearly a breach of his SHN. So, his application for renewal of his re-entry permit was rejected by ICA and his PR status therefore was effectively revoked, and he has been barred from coming into Singapore. So, these are quite serious penalties.We have another case. NIE terminated a foreign student from his postgraduate course, again for breaching his SHN and for repeatedly providing false information to NIE regarding his travel movements. His student pass was also terminated.I think Er Dr Lee's question may have been prompted by some of the messages that many of us have seen going around about recent returnees, particularly from the United Kingdom, that they are going out to eat local food, they hold birthday parties in their homes, they interact with friends, they go to clubs, bars and so on, while they were under SHNs. And many Singaporeans get upset when they hear about this.I think, either today or yesterday, another case was reported on an online site, Mothership – a Singaporean returning from Myanmar was apparently issued a SHN but he went out to have \"bak kut teh\" and posted about it on his Facebook page. I have asked for that case to be investigated.We are trying to verify some of these messages on SHNs being flouted. If anyone, a member of public, if you have information about such behaviour, please give it to the Police. We will follow up and we cannot allow such behaviour. So, I have given very clear instructions where these cases are verified to be true, we will charge them in Court.The second point is, when people are required to declare their travel history, there has to be honesty. Where false information is given, in order to avoid SHNs, there can be prosecution. Section 182 of the Penal Code carries a jail term of up two years or fine. Section 57(1)(g) of the Immigration Act also carries a jail term of up to 12 months, up to $4,000 fine, or both.But there is a wider duty that each of us owes to control the spread of COVID-19 and, really, not to endanger others and expose them to infection.One story going around – again, we are trying to verify – is that an individual is said to have gone for a holiday in Italy, developed symptoms of COVID-19 with a cough, fever and breathlessness. And this person apparently hid his symptoms and travel history in order to get on to a plane to come back to Singapore. And later, in Singapore, the person was admitted to the hospital, fell very ill, found to be carrying the virus.If this is true, the conduct is highly irresponsible. If he knew that there was a significant risk that he was infected but kept silent and went on the flight, then, he did so knowing that others could be infected.I can understand, as a Singaporean, he is anxious to come home, to his family. He is confident about our healthcare system, he wants to be here, but not at the risk of endangering other people's well-being. He should have declared his symptoms at check-in. Then, the airline would make a considered decision whether to allow the person to fly, and if so, with what sort of precautions. There cannot be this sort of unacceptable risk of infecting others.We have also received feedback from healthcare workers that some people are not truthful with their travel history when they see their GPs. Again, highly responsible. Our healthcare professionals, as Mr Gan has said, are our key asset in this fight. They are in the frontline; we all have to support them and not expose them in this way.So, on 23 March, ICA has announced that travellers into Singapore will have to fill in electronic health declaration from 27 March onwards. ICA will share this information – the electronic health declaration – with MOH so that they will know if a person has travelled to a high risk country. That information would allow us to identify persons who may be at risk, take precautions and provide them with the appropriate medical care.Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has put in place strict regulations and a strong enforcement framework. But regulations and strong enforcement are not going to be enough on their own, if people continue to insist on being irresponsible. All Singaporeans have to do our part, exercise social responsibility, protect ourselves, friends and family and fellow citizens.We are doing our best. The public officials – you have heard Minister Lawrence – have been working around the clock. And it has really been quite an exhausting few months for them. And this is a common fight. Most Singaporeans – you see it from the reaction – a vast majority of Singaporeans are responsible, understand this and have come together and acted admirably. But there will always a few who are irresponsible in every society and they risk undoing our efforts and put other people's lives at risk.So, if members of the public know of SHNs being flouted or breached, please tell the Police. We will take action against them. We have to take action against them. When we come together as a people, looking out for one another, we will prevail and we will overcome this COVID-19 situation.Mr Speaker: Mr Alex Yam.Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee): Thank you. Mr Speaker. The two Ministers, the co-chairs the Multi-Ministry Task Force, thanked many people. But I think we should also thank the members of the Multi-Ministry Task Force for their leadership in the last two months in guiding us through this crisis. Thank you to the Multi-Ministry Task Force team.I have three supplementary questions. The first is, under what circumstances will we consider a complete lockdown of the country. Many people have mentioned this and referred to other jurisdictions. But what are the implications to our country if we should adopt this measure.Secondly, there are many Singaporeans who are still overseas. I know of many who are attempting to come back to Singapore, but with increasing lockdowns and travel restrictions, what assistance are we providing to Singaporeans overseas who are attempting to come back to Singapore?The last question is in relation to the fact that Singapore is a pluralistic society, we are multi-religious and there are four major religious festivals coming up. We have Qingming Festival, Clear Bright Festival, Good Friday Easter, Ramadan as well as Vesak Day coming up on our calendars in the next two months. What are the advice and guidelines that religious institutions as well as believers should follow as we come close to these festivals in terms of gathering together and celebrating?Mr Lawrence Wong: Mr Speaker, where it comes to whether or not more drastic measures are needed, people use the word \"lockdown\". But let us look specifically at what additional measures we are contemplating, and I mentioned that just now.We have already put in place quite strict measures recently. The next step, if it is necessary, would be, as I mentioned, suspension of schools, which has to also go together with closure of some workplaces, aside from those providing essential services. They go together because if you were to suspend schools, many parents will need help looking after their children. And if they have to go to work, it will not be practical. It will be very difficult for them to do.So, the next step if we have to consider, what would be the considerations for that? It is not just the overall number of cases. We have to drill deeper to understand the reasons for these cases. If we continue to see more cases coming in and a lot of them are imported cases, and we are able to contain and ringfence and isolate them, we may not need to trigger the additional measures. But if we see more local transmitted cases, particularly unlinked ones, and that continues to rise, despite all that we are doing with strict safe distancing measures, then we may well need to activate the next set of brakes in order to slow down the spread of the virus.On the many Singaporeans who need assistance, we remain open to welcoming them. So, I think that if there is a need to, MFA and the overseas missions are reaching out to them. Flights have come down but commercial flights are still available for many of these countries.So, I would imagine people are making their own arrangements. Some have decided to stay and then some will decide to come back. And when they come back, we welcome them but we take the necessary precautions to make sure that they self isolate for the full period and do not cause any infection within our own community.For religious gatherings, we have made very clear there is a suspension of all religious congregations and services for the next month. The religious places of worships may remain open for people to go; individuals who need to get help from their religious leaders, that remains. So, the venues themselves remain open. Religious organisations, different faiths may want to do smaller groups. But if they do so, then we ask them to abide strictly by the guidelines. Each group less than 10 persons; and even within that grouping, make sure precautions are taken. So, minimise physical contact as much as possible and then, make sure that no one there is unwell. If anyone has been overseas recently, make sure that they are isolated. They should not be there to begin with. So, these are all precautions that religious organisations, in fact, every organisation should take. No more large gatherings. If there is a small group, keep it less than 10 and even then, take all the necessary precautions.Mr Speaker: Mr Yee Chia Hsing.Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang): Thank you, Speaker. First, I would like to declare my interest as a director of two SGX-listed companies. My work also requires me to advise SGX-listed companies. With the latest measures, SGX-listed companies will have to hold virtual meetings; and the attendance at virtual meetings will be much smaller than the usual shareholders' meetings, first, because there is no more buffet and the second is that among the less tech-savvy, they may not be so comfortable participating in the virtual meetings.Sir, some corporate actions, such as schemes of arrangements require minimum number as well as percentage of stakeholders to vote in favour. So, with the latest measures, will there be legislative amendments to allow such corporate actions to be passed during this period?Mr Lawrence Wong: Mr Speaker, MAS and SGX have already put out some guidelines on how companies listed entities can go about conducting their AGM and other activities during this period, precautions that they can take and we will continue to study if additional measures, including legislative measures, may be needed, if necessary.Mr Speaker: Ms Sylvia Lim.Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied): Thank you, Speaker. I have two clarifications for the Minister for Health. First, it is concerning the lethality of the virus. Earlier, he mentioned that if persons are young and healthy, even if they catch the virus, they are likely to get away with mild symptoms, such as a cough. And to get a sense of perspective, there have been some leaders overseas who have given a rough figure to say that 95% of the population need not worry about serious complications from COVID-19. It is just a 5%.So, I would like to ask the Minister whether he agrees that based on the experience we have had in Singapore, that this 95% to 5% proportion is also what we have seen in Singapore, meaning that only 5% who encounter the virus are likely to have serious complications.The second clarification is, could he give some information on the profile of the ICU patients with COVID-19? We know so far that the two deaths have concerned those who are elderly and with pre-existing conditions, but are there also significant numbers of patients in the ICU who are younger and do not have pre-existing conditions?Mr Gan Kim Yong: Thank you. Let me first stress that all of us must take COVID-19 seriously. It does not mean that the young do not have to take the disease seriously. Because there is always a risk that if you have more people, even young people, getting COVID-19, you may pass it on to the old people around you, including those with chronic diseases. And families as well.It is true from our data that those older patients and those with underlying chronic diseases, like cardiovascular diseases, tend to have more serious disease outcomes. So, it is important for us to enhance our protection for the elderly but we must not take the disease lightly.From our own experience in the ICU in our hospitals, we do see some young people who develop serious diseases. Part of the reason – I think I have explained during the last Sitting – is because of their auto immune system overreacting to the disease and therefore, it causes damage to their organs. We do have one or two patients in our ICU who are young and who happen to have very serious disease outcomes.But it is, I think, generally correct to say that this disease is likely to affect the seniors more severely and especially those with underlying chronic conditions. So, we have to pay particular attention to the seniors among us, but as the Prime Minister commented just now, even if young people get it, there is a risk that you pass it on to your family members, including the seniors in your family. So, we must always be careful.MOH has issued a set of guidelines for seniors as well as for young people when you interact with seniors. Do not just leave it to the seniors to protect themselves and we happily go to their homes to say \"Hello\" to them and share a dinner with them. We may be the vector, we may be the cause of their infection. So, do take precautions if you want to visit your seniors. I think it is not possible to ask ourselves to stop visiting seniors. We have to continue to visit them, but when you do so, exercise caution and practise a high level of personal hygiene, particularly when you are dealing with seniors.Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar): I would like to thank both Ministers for their update and also for their leadership on the task force so far. Two clarifications for the Minister for Health. First, I was very happy to hear of this new move to decant some of the less serious cases to community facilities. I would just like to ask whether considerations have been made to do what some other countries have done and allow the milder cases to self-isolate. Because if we do see larger numbers, that may even exceed the capacity of these community facilities. That is the first clarification.The second is that I was also very happy to hear the very high level of testing in Singapore. Because there have been some comments over the past weeks that perhaps Singapore has not been testing as much as other countries. So, I was very happy to hear of the very high level of testing that we have had. The clarification concerns whether we should consider testing those who have completed their QOs or the SHNs. Because there have been some concerns raised by certain experts that these people have been quarantined, could actually have developed very mild forms during that period – the 14 days. And maybe they did not notice it. It was not picked up. So, it could be that they could still be carrying the virus at the end of the 14 days or they may even become symptomatic after the 14 days.Mr Gan Kim Yong: We do have plans if the situation warrants to allow the milder cases to self isolate at home. We will serve them home quarantine or stay home notices to allow them to recover at home. But at the moment we do not need to do that because we still have community facilities that we can tap on, but it is part of our options.Secondly, on the level of testing. So far, we have a relatively high level of testing. But also we do very targeted testing. Because testing is not only laborious, it also requires resources to be put in place; not just for the testing but for the laboratory resources as well. So, it is very important for us to ensure that we are very targeted and focus on those who are at higher risk of infection. Therefore, for those who are under the Quarantine Orders or SHN, we also do risk assessment. For those who have a higher risk of exposure, we may do targeted testing for them. But we do not do blanket testing because that will first create a lot of false negatives, which give a false sense of assurance that \"You are okay\", and then, they go around spreading the virus. So, you should be always careful and mindful. Even for those who have been discharged, you must continue to be careful because if you are not infected, after you have left the quarantine facility, you may get infected. It does not ensure that you have lifelong immunity because you have never been infected before.So, therefore we must be very careful. We must assume that everyone has a potential of being infected, so we take the necessary precautions.Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have one question for Minister Wong. This pertains to the new and heightened restrictions announced yesterday evening by Minister, which were also the subject of his speech today. Since the release of the Electoral Boundary Review Committee report, I think it is quite apparent to a lot of Singaporeans that political parties have stepped up their political outreach. The concern in view of yesterday's announcements is that some of this these outreach activities can easily lead to the formation of large social gatherings in excess of 10 individuals, in close proximity to each other.Does the Minister not agree that such continued outreach could potentially interfere and contradict the directives of the task force, particularly yesterday's new directives? Because to quote the Minister, there was a concern that the safe distancing measures were not being taken seriously and that the public was generally too slow to respond to the new COVID-19 situation.So, to that end, can I confirm if the task force will be announcing some measures that all political parties can take into cognisance so that everybody is on the same page with regard to the task force's announcements vis-à-vis social distancing in other other measures?Mr Lawrence Wong: Mr Speaker, the task force is quite clear in putting out these measures that we want to restrict any form of activity that brings about congregations of more than 10 persons. That is a rule or that is an advisory and a guideline that we put out to all organisations. And all political parties in this House, outside of this House will therefore have to abide by these guidelines and make adjustments to their activities.Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member): Mr Speaker, I have four clarifications. Two for the Minister for Health, two for Minister for National Development. For Minister for Health, are there any plans by the Government to provide housing support to frontline healthcare workers who request it. That is because we have heard that there are some cases of healthcare workers, who out of caution, they want to isolate themselves from their families and they may or may not have the means to do so. So, that is the first.The second question is there are some reports elsewhere that indicate quite a high proportion of cases actually have no symptoms. For example, I think about half of the cases from The Diamond Princess cruise ship were non-symptomatic upon being diagnosed. So, are there any plans to investigate this in Singapore, for example, through voluntary random testing or something, to see whether we do in fact have quite a few people who were exposed and infected but there is nothing, no consequences there? Because this could help to inform our strategy going forward.For Minister for National Development, in the event of more strict control measures, what resources will be deployed to ensure that daily necessities can be distributed to the public, especially for those who are more vulnerable and in need because they may not be able to leave their home or may be very cautious about doing so. We do not want a situation where people cannot access daily necessities in the event of more strict measures. The other question on more strict measures is, currently, what are we doing to define essential services and to work with workplaces, employers and so on, so that everybody understands what is essential and what is not. Because I think we are seeing in many other countries, there is a lot of confusion about how this is being worked out on the ground. And I think if we have more strict measures and we rush to inform everybody, you are essential and you are not, we will have a lot of confusion and that could be too late. It might be good to start early.Mr Gan Kim Yong: Just to answer the first two questions. First, on the housing support for our frontline workers. We do have a scheme to help frontline workers. If they have this requirement, please let us know and we will try our best to help some of our frontline workers are staying in rented houses or rented apartments – we do want to appeal to the landlords to allow them to continue to stay in these apartments. In the hospital, they are given protective gear so they are safe, so allow them to continue. Let us not segregate them. Let us not ostracise them. We ought to be inclusive. That is the key message. But for healthcare workers who do need housing support, we have been working with the Clusters' management to extend our support to them.The second question on the asymptomatic cases. We do have asymptomatic cases. That means people who are infected that do not have symptoms or they have mild symptoms or their symptoms are so mild that patient themselves do not know that they have such an infection. But it is also professionally assessed that for those with very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, they are unlikely to spread because the spreading requires the projection of your droplets and so on. So, those require quite significant symptoms.Studies have shown that for the mild symptom cases, the risk of transmission is significantly lower. It is not that there is no risk at all, but the risk is significantly lower. So, that is the status.We are carrying out studies on surveillance and as well as serological tests to determine whether there were underlying cases that were not detected. So, some of these experiments and surveys are on-going.Mr Lawrence Wong: Mr Speaker, we are very mindful that in the event of stricter measures we want to ensure that the vulnerable groups have access to essential supplies and services. Even under today's environment where we put in place the range of measures that we have already announced, we were mindful of that and that is why we are still allowing F&B outlets to operate, people still need to go out to eat. But if they do so, then the setting is such that it is safe, it is separated and the F&B outlets remain open, the kitchens remain open, because food manufacturers, kitchens still need to generate the food and some of that can be ordered for take-out.So, these are things we are very mindful of and if indeed stricter measures are imposed, we will ensure some of these outlets remain open, in order for people to access food and essential supplies, and we can also mobilise volunteers who can help with the delivery of such items to vulnerable groups.Second, on the question on the framework for essential services, we do have such a framework in place and we will engage the key stakeholders. Of course, when the announcements – if and when announcements are made for stricter measures including closure of workplaces, aside from those doing essential services, then that would be announced. I think the Member's point is by the time you announce and put out the framework, people may well be scrambling and the reaction time may not be fast enough and there may be a little bit of anxiety at that point in time. We recognise that. We will do what we can and we are doing what we can to engage these firms. I think the firms who are tagged as essential services know who they are. The ones that do not, probably do not quite know and may think that they are essential even though they are not part of the framework. But we will be reaching out to more firms so that they are mindful and if additional measures are needed, we can ensure a smoother transition.Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson): I deeply appreciate all the efforts that have been put in so far. It is so good to be a Singaporean. I have a supplementary question. Given the call for heightened vigilance and enhanced measures for various reasons amongst which is also to reduce the risk of infection to innocent others around us, I would like to ask what would be done to enforce or curb behaviours that may pose risks to the public health of others and whether our laws and our current tools are sufficient to do so?Let me give one example. In my constituency, there is one man who has been very recalcitrant. What he did was that he lined his fingers with his saliva and just touched all the lift buttons. There would be saliva left behind on the panel. The CCTV footage caught that but NEA cannot prosecute him because it is not spitting. And so, currently, it is being looked into. However, there is concern to the public health of other residents who have to share the lift. So, I would like to ask whether we are adequately equipped to take action on such a very inconsiderate individual.Mr Gan Kim Yong: The Member can give us the details and we will follow up on this particular case. I think the Minister for Home Affairs has already talked about those who fail to comply with our Stay-Home Notices and Quarantine Orders. Those, we will take care of. Even those behaviours that endanger the health and safety of the public, we have sufficient legal powers to go after them. So, I will encourage members of the public – if you come across any of these actions that put public safety or health in danger, do let us know and we will go after them. We need everyone to play their part to keep Singapore safe and healthy.Mr Speaker: Ms Anthea Ong.Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank both Ministers for the Ministerial Statements. I especially appreciate Minister Wong's sharing. I have got three clarifications.The first one is: what are we doing with the safe distancing measures in public transport? I am a public commuter so I have not seen any changes in that regard.The second is: if Minister Gan can also share what is the number of infected cases or, in terms of its tipping point where our healthcare capacity will start to be under burdened, what is the number of infected cases that would actually get us to that tipping point?The third point is relating to the communications on the advisories that are going out. It is very rapid, it is also changing as what Minister Wong says, every other day. Some of the elderly folks have shared with me they are not able to keep up with what is going on. I am just wondering if there could be — well, first, I would like to understand how we are actually getting the information out to the different segments of the society; and secondly, if there is a central agency that is managing this in the form of FAQs or handling queries from citizens when they are not sure about is nine persons in terms of gatherings okay; and if a gathering is for community work instead of social gathering, is that okay? There are a lot of questions that are coming out and I wonder if there is a need for a central agency to handle that.Mr Gan Kim Yong: Let me address the question on healthcare capacity and the burden on healthcare facilities. I will leave it to Minister Wong to talk about public transport as well as the advisory. I should also take this opportunity to thank Minister for Communications and Information, Mr Iswaran, who is always in the background. But his Ministry and him have been very crucial; they play a very vital role in managing our public communications, the WhatsApp that you receive from Gov.sg came from the Ministry, so we want to thank MCI for their hard work.On the healthcare facilities. We always try to have a benchmark beyond which we turn on the switch or turn off the switch. But in the healthcare system, we do not operate like that. We look at the whole scenario and disease pattern, and we adjust as we go along. So, even today, if you ask me, we are under pressure too. Our resources are stretched but we make adjustments to accommodate the trend of the growing number of cases. If the cases continue to grow we will continue to adjust. As I mentioned today, we have started to send patients to private hospitals and we are sending patients with mild and stable conditions to our community isolation facilities. These are our strategies to keep our healthcare system moving and still maintaining certain buffer capacity, in case there is a surge.Unfortunately, I would not be able to give you a single number because it is really a whole set of conditions and we adjust as we go along. I think we have sufficient flexibility in the healthcare system.Mr Speaker: Mr Lawrence Wong.Mr Lawrence Wong: Mr Speaker, the issue of public transport again cannot be looked at in isolation because it has to be considered together with measures we take, for example, at workplaces. In order to reduce crowdedness and in order to reduce volumes on public transport, particularly during the peak periods, it is vital that companies take action and employers take action to do two things: one, get as many of their employees and staff to work from home; and second, for those who really have to come to the office, put in place staggered hours. We have issued the advisories; the Public Sector is going all out to do it. But, as I mentioned earlier, we know that more still can be done and has to be done.So, MOM, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo, MTI, we are all reaching out engaging employers and getting them to step up and do more. We have to go more aggressively on telecommuting in order to bring down the loading on the public transport system during peak hours.On communications, as Minister Gan said, we have a whole-of-Government approach. MOH is the front because you see the statements, advisories, they are all put out under the banner of MOH. All of the information is on the MOH website, but really behind the scenes is a whole-of-Government communications team coordinated by Minister Iswaran and the MCI communications team. A lot of people are working day and night because of the rapid – the nature of the work is such that we are putting out new information so rapidly, so they are constantly generating infographics, materials in different languages and pushing them pushing them out through multiple platforms.We can continue to improve. I think the team will always look at ways in which it can do better, particularly reaching out to segments that may not be accessing the information so readily and we will always look at different ways where we can put up more information. So, that work is continuing. We know it is a vital work that has to be done and we are sparing no effort to ensure that the information is put out in a timely and accurate manner.We will also, during this period, be able to leverage on resources outside of the Public Sector. In fact, there is spare capacity out in the private sector. There are call centres, there are people who can be enlisted to help us in this outreach and so we are also looking at leveraging on these resources, so it need not and should not be a Government effort alone. We really need a whole of Singapore effort in order to fight the virus.Mr Speaker: Mr Darryl David.Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the Ministers for their statements, especially Minister Lawrence Wong earlier for the reassurance that Singaporeans who are returning to Singapore after spending some time overseas, will be able to come back to the haven that we all call home.My question is on outbound travel, Mr Speaker, and that is, I understand that we have been more and more stringent with outbound travel moving from advisory that says only for essential travel, and now moving to all travel. But my question is, in light of the fact that the situation is more heightened, will we be even stricter with the travel of our Singaporeans and Singapore residents overseas, knowing full well that if they travel out, a significant proportion of these outbound travellers will then have to come back? So, will the Government ever consider limiting travel, perhaps, requiring outbound travellers to seek unique and special permission, and then when they come back, how would we propose to manage these cases differently from those returning cases of people who have already been out for some time?Mr Lawrence Wong: Mr Speaker, we have already highlighted some of the deterrence that we are putting in place for outbound, new outbound travellers, including the fact that they have to pay fullcost when they come back and should they need treatment. And the fact that when they are returning, upon returning they have to serve the full self-isolation period of 14 days and pay fullcost for that as well.We will continue to see if other measures are needed. I am just very mindful that for every new measure we put in place, there is a requirement to have new operational requirements, new processes, new staff work to be done and all of this takes up resources. So, at the end of the day, this is about looking at how we allocate resources to areas of urgent needs and priorities. So, we will first monitor the volume of outflows. It is already coming down and if the measures we have are effective in bringing the volumes down further, I think we should be all right.In any case, I think there will still be some people who might very well need to travel, for whatever reasons – maybe there is a bereavement, that somebody had passed away in the family, outside of Singapore and they really need to go and I can understand why.So, I do not think the numbers will fall to zero but if it comes down to a number that we are able to manage, we should be okay. But if the numbers continue to persist and do not come down further, then, indeed more measures will be necessary and we will consider what additional measures at that stage will be introduced.Mr Speaker: Mr Mohamed Irshad.Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member): I thank both Ministers for sharing what efforts are being taken by the Government and on daily basis, through the press conference.Several clarifications. The contact tracing is also done by our Police officers from Singapore Police Force. Just wanted to seek clarification on whether their policing work is impacted by the amount of the time they are spending with the contact tracing? Four thousand contact tracings done per day. So, how much of this is impacting the Police work?And secondly, is on misinformation. I thank MCI for the dedicated timely pushing out of information daily. The question is on misinformation with regards to things like live telecast of Prime Minister's speech that was circulated on WhatsApp, call for volunteers at MOH call centres, impending lockdown and so on. A lot of the misinformation is sent on private messaging platforms and timely clarifications are posted on MOH website and various other websites. Is it worthwhile considering setting up just a microsite just for all these clarifications to be posted so that people can have a one-stop place where we can see what is being circulated and timely responses are posted and we can always refer to it as a first touch point.And third on social distancing on public transport, I hear Minister Lawrence Wong's comments. I think it is very important to encourage telecommuting amongst our workforce to reduce the travellers commuting at peak times and so on. But the point is, if you go to public transport sites – bus stations, MRT stations and so on – even at the escalators, people are just lining up back to back of each other. That is not just during peak hours but also non-peak hours. So, how can we implement safe distancing within bus stations, within MRT stations and also on the bus itself we can have one seat beside each other to be vacant, we can actually Implement some sort of measures even on the MRT trains to have one seat in between each other. So, I think more thought can be given on that because if you are encouraging safe distancing everywhere and we have public transportation where a lot of people are moving in masses —Mr Speaker: Keep it short, please. Thank you.Mr Mohamed Irshad: It is an area we can look at. I have two other clarifications.Mr Speaker: Can we keep it tight?Mr Mohamed Irshad: Okay. We have a policy of people coming back from overseas to be issued Stay-Home Notice but however, Singaporeans who want to visit their relatives who just came back and visit the houses, how can we discourage them from doing so? Because there have been cases where they go and visit the people who are staying at home, even though they limit the exposure time but it is still exposure. These are some clarifications to be sought.Mr Gan Kim Yong: I will answer on behalf of Minister for Home Affairs on Police work. First, I want to thank the Police for helping us to do contact tracing. Of course, there are also others, including the SAF who are helping us as well. But I want to assure you that despite the involvement in the contact tracing, their duties as a Police Force has never been diminished. And for criminals who think that they may have an easy time during this period, perish the thought.On the misinformation, I will ask Minister Iswaran to respond in a while. I will ask Minister Wong to answer the rest of the questions.Mr Lawrence Wong: I will address the question on public transport. Mr Irshad is right that we should have safe distancing measures even within the public transport system. But the first priority has to be just to reduce the numbers. If the numbers are still high, having safe distancing within a train or bus will mean the queue goes up somewhere else. It would be in the bus stop, it will be outside the train station, there will still be a congregation. So, I think before we talked about measures within a train, in the escalators, stations and all that, all necessary, we have to bring down the sheer volume. The only way to do that, as I said earlier – telecommuting, staggered hours, all employers must push harder on this.Mr Speaker: Minister Iswaran.Mr S Iswaran: Mr Speaker, I think the Member has made an important point about the need to address misinformation swiftly and decisively. Let me just say that first, our emphasis has been on ensuring that information is put out accurately by authoritative sources. So, for a start, the Multi-Ministry Task Force co-chairs together with, usually the Director for Medical Services as well as other Ministers as appropriate and other officials as appropriate, have been conducting regular press conferences. And this has been an important part of our effort to ensure that there is regular communication and also regular representation – faces associated with the communications – so that Singaporeans have a point of focus and a point of assurance in this entire effort.Secondly, there have been regular background briefings that are being conducted by the Director for Medical Services and various other officials from time to time. This occurs as I have said, in the background, but it is a very important part of ensuring that the media understand the context of the decisions that are being made and the rationale, so that, when they report and convey those decisions, they can contextualise these correctly.Thirdly, the Member has raised specifically the point on misinformation, we have had to deal with it through a variety of measures. Of course, in the most extreme circumstances, we have had to use some of the powers available to us under the newly enacted POFMA legislation. I think Members will be aware of that. We have also tried to use other channels to push out information proactively but also sometimes reactively. So, in some of the instances that the Member has cited, for example, when there was a information passing around about Prime Minister's impending address to the nation and all kinds of rumours associated with it, we did push out something through the gov.sg WhatsApp. For Members' information, today, we push out on a daily basis, something of the order of magnitude of over 900,000 messages each time and that is in the four languages – English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil.The last point I want to make in response to the Member's comment that, whilst we can consider things like microsites and so on, as a kind of inventory of some of these clarifications that we put out, the crux of the matter really is in being able to counter such misinformation quickly. And I think we can do that in two ways.The first is, of course, on the part of the Government in terms of how we are able to put out the information, the correct information through all the channels available to us and we will continue to work at it and improve on it.The second is – I think this is largely the most important point – what Singaporeans can do ourselves and I think it has been salutary to see how Singaporeans now – often I get a lot of these messages and I am sure Members do too – the first instinct is ask: is this correct or is this fake? And I think that instinct is the right one, not to immediately press forward and pass it on to all our chat groups. But, to first verify, understand, before we share. I think if we do that, that will be the strongest defence against misinformation.Mr Speaker: Dr Lily Neo.Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar): Thank you, Mr Speaker. May I ask Minister for Health on MOH's capacity in coping with serious cases of COVID-19 in terms of adequacy in respirators and in our ICU beds. Am I correct to say that already half of NCID's ICUs are taken up? What will happen when it reaches its full capacity? And may I also ask the Minister, so far, what is the average length of stay of patients in our ICU beds by COVID-19 cases?Mr Gan Kim Yong: I thank Dr Lily Neo for her very important questions, always. The capacity of ICU in NCID, we still have capacity and we have room to expand the capacity. But, I must say that the main constraint is not so much in the physical capacity, but on the manpower. Because we do want to make sure that our healthcare manpower are properly deployed in the most impactful place. Many of them are very stretched and very tired, and some of them have fatigue. We try to support them as much as we can, but what is most important is all of us do our part to keep the numbers low, to keep the cases low, to help prevent transmission. In this way, we will do our part in helping these healthcare workers. We do have flexibility to expand our ICU capacity, if necessary.In terms of average length of stay, it is very difficult to have average length of stay for ICU because each case is quite different. There are some cases who went in for a few days, they are able to recover. If their lung function has recovered, we will discharge them to normal wards. But there are some who have been in there for quite some time, some may be more than a month. So, it is not very meaningful to have average length of stay in terms of ICU because it does differ from patient to patient.Generally, for those who go into ICU, they tend to stay a bit longer because the conditions are more serious. We do keep a lookout for them, we try to provide them with as much support as possible, because in the end, for infections like COVID-19, we depend to a large extent, on their own immunity system to take over, to fight the infection.Mr Speaker: Mr Dennis Tan.Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have two questions. My first question is for Minister Lawrence. Could I ask the Minister to shed some clarity on the rationale behind the action to be taken in the event that a there is an infected staff or pupil in a school. For example, what is the rationale behind decisions, for example, in deciding whether a school should be closed for the day for cleaning or should be close for two weeks or whether Stay-Home Notices should be issued to pupils and staff. I think some parents would like to know more details of this.My second question relating to our manpower needs. I believe I have asked a Parliamentary Question relating to this. I would like to ask, perhaps, the Minister for Manpower or any Minister, what is the status of the reported 30,000 Chinese workers who were at home much earlier, during the Chinese New Year period. How many of them have returned and if they have not returned, when are they expected to return?Mr Lawrence Wong: Mr Speaker, on the first question on the rationale for whether or not if something were to happen, whether the centre, pre-school or school is closed for day for cleaning or for longer periods of time, it really depends on the particular instance, the incident, the person who is infected, and then, the contacts that that person may have had with people around him or her. And this is done through the MOH team – they go down, they assess, they make a very thorough investigation. If the finding is that there is no exposure at all for that individual with other people around the infected person, then there may not be a need for an extensive closure. And then, you just closed for one or two days, make sure everything is disinfected, cleaned, and then, you can proceed. But, if the assessment is that there is a broader range of context within that particular environment and potentially more people may be impacted, then, they will give the advice to the centre that it is better to close for a longer period of time. So, there is an objective and very thorough assessment made in each and every case.The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo): Mr Speaker, I believe that Mr Dennis Tan was referring to the initial estimate of the number of PRC workers that were out of Singapore when we started imposing travel restrictions on them returning to Singapore.A good number of them have not returned. Because, right now, we are requiring approvals before any one of the work pass holders can re-enter Singapore, if they are outside. Actually, that number that is flowing through every day has been slowed to a trickle. In order not to burden our healthcare system, we have prioritised Singapore Citizens as well as Permanent Residents and Long-Term pass holders coming back. Whereas, for foreign work pass holders, we have asked them to stay out of Singapore for the time being and then, when the situation enables us to facilitate their return, we will do so.Mr Speaker: Order. End of Ministerial Statements. Leader."

        "Content": "Debate resumed.Mr Deputy Speaker: Prof Lim Sun Sun.6.57 pmProf Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member): Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.The saying goes that a week is a long time in politics. COVID-19 has shown us that a week is an eternity in a pandemic.As the coronavirus continues to rage through countries worldwide, it leaves a trail of destruction – claiming lives, industries, businesses and, of course, jobs. The Resilience and Solidarity Budgets are therefore most welcome indeed and will be a tremendous source of encouragement to the many who have been adversely affected. I have, nevertheless, solicited feedback from people across multiple industry sectors to offer suggestions on how these extraordinary provisions can be further refined. Some of the ideas I raise may come across as unorthodox but may have merits so I air them here in the spirit of collective innovation. These suggestions pertain to three aspects – generating work, stimulating spending and supporting SMEs.Like many other people, my calendar has become blissfully clear with many events postponed indefinitely, or cancelled entirely. While the Government has introduced many schemes to provide industries with cash flow during this critical period, another approach may be to generate actual work so that industries can still chug along. For example, training programmes, workshops and conferences should still proceed by migrating online, thereby allowing event organisers and trainers to maintain their business, while gaining valuable experience in digitalisation.If the Government Ministries proceed with their original calendar of events in the coming months, training programmes and outreach campaigns, it sends a strong signal that it is business as usual, and supporting industries will also respond with creative online provisions. These events can still involve the production of conference materials that can be delivered to attendees, thereby also generating demand for additional services.If our Government Ministries and agencies continue to commission work rather than take a \"wait and see\" approach, the private sector will also follow its lead and this will create opportunities for smaller businesses to earn some revenue.Another suggestion pertains to paying for work already done. Many Government contracts have been halted with work done half way by contractors. Contractually, payments may not be due but it would be a positive gesture for the Government to see if they can pay for work already completed or reimbursement for expenses incurred by contractors. As individual departments within Ministries may not have the discretion to make such decisions independently, some high level directive on this front would be a helpful signalling effect.The next suggestion relates to stimulating spending by consumers. With the recent lull in consumer spending and understandable dip in consumer confidence, retailers are, obviously, bleeding. The Government’s efforts to help with daily expenses in the form of one-off cash payouts and expenses for families will certainly help to ease families’ consumption needs.Another possibility to explore is to offer shopping vouchers instead of cash. By working with retail consortia to exploit economies of scale, the vouchers can even have a value higher than their cash value. These vouchers can come with a limited validity period of perhaps three months to boost near term spending so that retailers can earn revenue sooner, and therefore, have the cash flow to retain their staff. Should the effects of the ongoing crisis persist for longer, more vouchers can be issued at a later juncture.While this is a somewhat unorthodox suggestion, the Government is in fact no stranger to vouchers as it has previously gifted past and present National Servicemen with S$100 NS50 vouchers as part of the NS50 Recognition Package. These NS50 vouchers could be used at more than 6,000 participating outlets and services, including major grocery stores and dining chains and indeed boosted revenue for these participating companies.Moving on to supporting SMEs, feedback from these businesses suggests that cash flow is their biggest issue. Even as they have to continue to pay rents, overheads and salaries, their revenue has either slowed to a trickle or come to a complete standstill. I am, therefore, heartened by the Deputy Prime Minister's announcement today of many new or enhanced support packages, including the Enhanced Enterprise Financing Scheme and the SME Working Capital Loan.I would, therefore, like to echo Labour Chief Ng Chee Meng's call for the aid to come sooner.For the SMEs that still can generate some revenue even during the pandemic, they are now faced with unanticipated expenses. Those that involve interfacing with customers such as F&B establishments are now finding that masks, sanitisers and disposable ware are a rapidly ballooning expense and need help to keep thecosts of such items low. As for SMEs that are being asked to shift their services to the digital realm, they are finding that Government grants do not seem to support thecost of adopting video-conferencing solutions such as Zoom.Additionally, Government grant audit systems need to adapt to the digital environment as well. While training sessions are now encouraged to shift online, contractors now need to provide and record a full eight hours of online interaction. However, this does not take into account the fact that online training is more effective when it adopts a mixture of approaches such as flipped learning or blended learning. A mere replication of face-to face training will not work well in digital learning. It is therefore unrealistic to use old systems to assess new modes of instruction.Finally, I have also received feedback that many start-ups have stalled as most do not qualify for the grants that have been rolled out. They too are asking for help as they fear they will not survive this crisis, however innovative their offerings.I hope some of these ideas can be considered and adapted to the extent that they are practicable. I support the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets.Mr Deputy Speaker: Mr Alex Yam.7.04 pmMr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee): Mr Deputy Speaker, I usually prepare my speeches well in advance but with the newly announced Solidarity Budget, I have to rewrite, so my apologies to the translators for not having sent my speeches to you.Mr Deputy Speaker, how many people does it take to screw in a light bulb? Or in this case, how many Singaporeans does it take to reset a circuit breaker? When we were first in this House no 18 February, the lights were still on, perhaps, flickering a little bit, but nothing to be too worried about. The Deputy Prime Minister Heng, at that time, introduced the Unity Budget, much like a new starter installed into a flickering light. But we also had plans to quickly move towards LED lighting and solar panelling, to be better prepared for the future.Yet, almost soon after, we had a power trip. The lights went out as COVID-19 cases blew out the lights. We quickly brought in a qualified electrician and a Resilience Budget on 26 March. It turned on the emergency lighting so that Singaporeans would not stumble. Soon after, we realised that the emergency lights only worked indoors. And to get help, we needed to venture out a little further. In came the Solidarity Budget that was announced today, providing Singaporeans, perhaps, with a flash light, so that we can light our way in the darkness, so that Singaporeans who may have to be at home for a month are not left without a path out when the storm passes.We must not, however, overload our circuit, even though we hope to reset it as soon as possible. During this period, we must bite the bullet and adhere to the circuit breaker rules. We need to make sure that our collective actions add up. Just like a trip in the system, we all need to switch off before resetting the circuits, or risk tripping or worst still, shorting the entire circuit.So, every time we leave our house during this month for purposes beyond what is essential, we are literally tripping the system again. That would put the flash light to naught, as a catastrophic failure or ground fault would blow up the circuit, and wouldcost us exponentially – in economic as well as humancosts. That, we can ill afford.So, the answer is, it takes all Singaporeans to reset the circuits. It takes all of us so that the drawdown from our reserves will be worthwhile, so that we do not end up bankrupting ourselves because of irresponsible actions that individuals may take.The next point I would like to make a something that I am glad that Deputy Prime Minister Heng touched on. And that is the long-term mental health impact of this crisis. The scale of COVID-19 is unprecedented and our three Unity, Resilience and Solidarity Budgets are also unprecedented to address the impact of this virus on lives and livelihoods. Yet, we cannot ignore the long-term impact to the mental health of Singaporeans, even after the virus subsides the most recent mental health index, which is a longitudinal study in Canada, showed a dramatic 12-point drop in the overall mental health situation in Canada due to COVID-19 and the lockdown. We also know from SARS that quarantined persons exhibited a higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress syndrome.With the circuit breaker announced, a mother remarked, \"Before schools close, my kids had a 1% chance of contracting COVID-19. Now, we have home-based learning starting Wednesday, and us working from home, I have a 99% chance of either going crazy or suffering a stroke.\" But on a more serious note, many of the little comforts that we took for granted in our daily lives will not be possible in the coming months. Habits like going to our favourite coffee shop; for our elders, going down for a chat; mingling, having a beer the end of the day. All these will not be possible.Even spiritual comforts like going to our religious institutions have not been possible for some time. Today is the beginning of Holy Week for Christians. It is the climax of the Christian year, but yet our churches are closed. And this creates a major impact on the mental health of people who see these little things as comfort in their week, in their daily lives.Healthcare workers as well. On Friday, I shared on my social media, a correspondence that I had with a friend who works as a frontline doctor. He told me that he had never at his age considered the need to look at will, to plan ahead for his young family. But he did. He wrote it down. He was worried because he said that being on the frontline, he could see daily, the number of cases that were coming in. He could also see the patients who are not getting better or perhaps getting worse before they could get better. He could see the volume of cases. He could see his co-workers under pressure as well, having spent month after month working to combat this virus.For him and many of the healthcare workers. This is an untold toll on them. To be watching as people grow in numbers, as the infection numbers go up, as pressures on them grow, as the number of deaths may unfortunately increase, despite the best of their efforts. This is something that we have to be conscious about. And I told him that I really hope that that will that he wrote, and perhaps, that many other healthcare professionals have decided to do so, would not be put to use anytime soon, that they would have a long and healthy life ahead of them; and he would be able to spend many more happy years with his wife as well as his young daughter.For many of the people who have come to our Community Clubs (CCs) over the last few days to apply for the Temporary Relief Fund, I spent two days at my CC, speaking to some of them helping to process the documents as well. And a few of them looked shell-shocked. Tthey never expected to be in this situation, to feel a sense of loss to feel that there is nothing for them to look forward to daily or worrying about how they are going to feed their families. My constituency is not particularly low income but the number of people who came with large; some perhaps to try it out, but the vast majority were people from different sectors who did not expect to be so affected by this crisis. And for many of them, they had never planned for this this rainy day. So, whatever we do for them now, may be a temporary stop-gap measure. But what is more worrying is the impact on their mental health over the long term.So, we need to do a lot more not just during this crisis so that Singaporeans have a leg-up, so that Singaporeans know that they are not forgotten, but we also have to be prepared for the long term impact that this COVID-19 crisis will have on Singapore and Singaporeans.It will have an economic toll over the long term. It will have a toll on family life over the long term as well. And for us, we must constantly reach out to one another to assure each other that we are in this together, and only by being together, can we continue to be Singapore strong, that we can overcome.And I hope that with the Unity, the Resilience and the Solidarity Budgets – URS – yours, yours! Your Budget will be all that we need; that we do not need to dip in once again, that we can come out of this crisis as soon as possible and reduce the impact on Singapore and Singaporeans.Mr Deputy Speaker: Mr Gan Thiam Poh.7.14 pmMr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio): Deputy Speaker, Sir, once again, let me thank all the healthcare workers and all frontline personnel for the hard work they have done so far to keep Singapore safe for all of us. I would also like to thank all Singaporeans for working together, failing which, we would not be here today.It is with a heavy yet grateful heart that I rise to support this Supplementary Resilience and Solidarity Budget. It has only been a few weeks since we concluded the Debate on our annual Budget Statement. In the short period since, the COVID-19 crisis has escalated and I had been hoping that the worst is over.Around the world, hundreds of thousands of people have been infected and tens of thousands have died. This is an unprecedented global health, financial and social crisis. The world, as we knew it, has changed drastically.Here in Singapore, in our day-to-day lives, while there have been some changes to our routines, we have not yet experienced the magnitude of the impact many other countries have. Hopefully, we will be able to continue to buy time with these supportive measures. No one knows how long or how deep the crisis will be. I am glad that Deputy Prime Minister Heng has given all of us the assurance that additional measures or the extension of announced measures will be considered should the crisis be prolonged.Notwithstanding these uncertainties, let us strive to have our businesses to resume activities and recover as quickly as possible with all the latest additional measures in place and implemented successfully. Revenue is the lifeblood of businesses. More businesses would collapse if sales remain stagnant or decline further. We must do what we can to minimise and slow the potential domino effect.I applaud the schemes to support our businesses but the implementation would perhaps need some Government intervention. For example, according to some stallholders and tenants, their landlords have not reduced rents for them despite these extraordinary circumstances. The new legislation to ensure that landlords pass on property tax rebates in full to their tenants would help businesses to a certain degree. On the other hand, some landlords complain that stallholders and tenants have delayed paying their rents or that they have lost rentals due to rising vacancies. Yet, they have to continue to meet their mortgage payments to the banks and finance companies. I suppose everyone has his difficulties and plight and the root of the problem is revenue loss and the resulting cashflow problems.Retail companies, including those downstream industries supporting tourism, are requesting to increase the wage offset under the Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme for their sector from 25% to 50%, for the remaining qualifying months beyond April. Same as for food and beverage firms.  Other feedback includes more lenient criteria for reduction or waiver of the foreign workers' levy for staff who are serving Leave of Absence or Stay-Home Notices beyond April; reducing the road tax for logistics companies and providing more rental assistance to JTC and HDB commercial tenants.Gig workers, such as Grab delivery staff, need help, too. They are considered self-employed. How would the Government reach out to them and auto-include them in assistance schemes?We would need to continue to encourage enterprises and investments and I urge the Government, its agencies and various private sector firms which may have put some projects on hold, to proceed to award contracts and carry out their plans, all of which will help to stimulate our economy and create jobs.In the meantime, we must all do our part to boost the level of hygiene in our public areas. The public education effort has been intensive. We must heed the advice not only during this trying period but also beyond and adopt such hygienic practices as our way of life to reduce the spread of diseases. From the correct handwashing technique to utilising and disposing of tissues properly, new norms for social interactions and use of public facilities, how will the Government ensure compliance? What will be done to enhance the hygiene at the hawker centres and public toilets? How do we encourage more tray returns and get food handlers and stall holders to wear hair caps and spit-guards?In addition, how will the Government work with property owners to ensure cleanliness, especially for food and retail establishments, hawker centres, coffeeshops and public areas? These efforts will require quickly stepping up the professionalisation of the cleaning sector with training and certification. The crisis also highlights how dependent we are on foreign workers to maintain a clean Singapore and how we need to expedite the adoption of technology to overcome the problem of limited manpower resources.The COVID-19 crisis has also brought to the fore the urgency of ramping up our own food supply as part of a set of measures to enhance our food security. Supply chains have been disrupted and are under stress due to lockdowns and the impact of the virus on logistics staff and workers around the world. Will the Government share how much the impact has affected our food supply?Our 30-30 vision will have to be brought forward. This is a challenging but necessary task, considering that we import 90% of our food. How will the Government do so? How can we attract more Singaporeans to this sector and what are the challenges faced by our local farms? How are we tapping on new techniques and technology to overcome our local constraints? Deputy Speaker, in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Many countries around the world are currently in a state of emergency, imposing border controls, no-fly rules and local movement controls. The outbreak has dealt an unprecedented blow to the aviation, transportation, entertainment, arts, tourism, hotel and catering industries. Because of the extreme panic, the financial sector is also abnormal. Almost all assets were sold for cash. Stocks and bonds, and even gold, were sold, leading to the collapse of many companies. The collapse in oil prices has made the global economy worse.My residents and friends around me have expressed their understanding and full support for the many measures the Government must take to prevent the epidemic, but they are equally concerned that \"people starve to death before the virus is dead\" (in Hokkien).While we cannot predict how long the crisis will last, we need to remain positive, prepare for the global recovery and stay ahead of the competition. We must pay attention to the dynamics of our environment. Take a simple example. Recently, because Malaysia implemented movement control, durian merchants have difficulty picking up from their suppliers, durian prices have plummeted, and the merchants, in order to survive, turned to selling eggs instead, with excellent results. We are facing a turning point in history. The way the world works will change dramatically. Individuals, businesses and nations have to rethink the way they work, their business models and their governance policies, how to turn failures into successes, how to keep up with the times, even leaping ahead of the competition.We must remain united and prove to the world that we Singaporeans are resilient in order to continue to attract high-quality investments to Singapore. I am confident that even during this crisis, we can create quality jobs for all Singaporeans and even as we fight this crisis, make good preparations for our future.We also need to work with countries around the world to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Even the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), which controls the Gaza Strip, has joined forces with Israel to fight the outbreak.Finally, I would like to borrow the famous poem \"Qingming\" by Tang poet Du Mu and paraphrase it to express our aspirations:A pandemic in this time of Qing Ming;Businesses shut down with broken hearts;Don’t ask when this outbreak will end,Fight together to end the pandemic, we play our parts!7.25 pmDr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio): Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak in this debate on our Resilience and now Solidarity Budget, which is a much-needed and generous assistance package for many Singaporeans during this challenging time. I wish to express gratitude for the hard work put in by Prime Minister Lee, Deputy Prime Minister Heng, the Inter-Ministerial COVID-19 task force and our civil and public servants who have worked tirelessly to manage the COVID-19 situation and put in place the necessary support and assistance for Singaporeans during this difficult period.I am heartened and moved by the extent of assistance provided in the Resilience Budget and now the Solidarity Budget – for employees, employers, business owners, the self-employed, job-seekers, the unemployed, and low-income and middle income families, among other specific segments of our society.As the various assistance schemes and initiatives are being rolled out, Singaporeans will need to stay resilient and innovative in keeping their heads above water as the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 outbreak will continue to plague us for many more months ahead.In my speech, I wish to speak on three matters which residents have raised with me. One, plight of the self-employed and future of the gig economy; two, employment opportunities for job-seekers and school leavers; and three, fees and loans payment.First, on the plight of the self-employed and future of the gig economy. The Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) is very generous in helping Self Employed Persons (SEPs) over a period of nine months. This will certainly help SEPs during this difficult period. While the current SIRS scheme is useful, we should never rule out the possibility of other possible crises from happening in the future and which may put one's income-earning potential at risk once more, which is particularly more likely for SEPs.Hence, my concern is what happens after the nine months. Will our SEPs be able to find a more permanent form of employment that will provide them with a more stable income in future? How can we encourage greater participation in the SEP Training Support Scheme and other employment assistance schemes, such as Career Trial or Attach-and-Train? Can a more targeted employment assistance be rendered to SEPs to help them secure a more permanent and stable form of employment for the future?My other concern is regarding businesses that are severely affected because of the COVID-19 outbreak. While business owners can leverage on the Jobs Support Scheme to retain their current employees until October this year, what will happen thereafter? It will be very difficult for business owners to recoup losses incurred during this period, and they may decide to scale down their operations considerably and cutcosts eventually. One of the ways in which they may decide to scale down their operations and cutcosts, would be to let go of permanent hires and outsource work to freelancers or those doing gig work. This may lead to a growth of the gig economy, which may be acceptable during healthy economic growth. But during periods of crises, such as now, we will once again have income insecurity among the freelancers and those doing gig work. What more can we do to help them have better income security despite periods of crises?Two, on employment opportunities for job-seekers and school leavers. I am reassured that the Government is looking to help job-seekers, in particular, first-time job-seekers just entering the job market. It is a very challenging time to be looking for employment, especially when you do not have sufficient work experience.Even among my students in the University, some have shared their difficulty in securing a more permanent employment because of the current economic uncertainty. Those particularly affected are in the hospitality and tourism as well as design sectors.While the SG United Traineeship programme will be able to provide our young people with opportunities to gain invaluable work experience, to enhance their employability and eventually land a relatively secure job, our students do question whether the few years they spent in a specific programme preparing for a job in an industry which is not able to provide employment for them has been a futile effort.I hope that under the SG United Traineeship programme, recent University, Polytechnic and ITE graduates who are looking to gain employment in an industry that is different from the one they have been trained in, will be given recognition for their academic training and qualification as well as related work experience, and can be accorded some form of recognition for these when they are granted employment in a different sector thereafter.Three, fee and loan payment. The freezing of all Government fees and charges for one year until 31 March 2021 is a much welcomed move. It helps to ease the financial burden for new graduates who are facing difficulty in securing employment during this period. The suspension of late payment charges on HDB mortgage arrears will help many Singaporean households better manage their tight finances during this period.However, what about late payment charges for other fees, such as telco and utilities, where consumption is likely to increase as more Singaporeans work from home? Can they also be waived for residents for a period of six months or so?In addition, I have residents who have written in to ask for a redirection of childcare or student care fees during the \"circuit-breaker\" period until 4 May 2020. Can the childcare or student care fees already paid during this period be redirected to pay for the later months when childcare or student care services are in full operations again? At this juncture, Mr Deputy Speaker, please allow me to speak in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]The COVID-19 outbreak has transformed our lives. Most of us did not expect the advent of this pandemic and the resulting changes. It has impacted our income, jobs and businesses within a very short period of time. Many were also unprepared to deal with the challenges that came along with it. Among the challenges that must be addressed are related to financial issues and having enough savings to tide over this difficult economic times, especially for those who are self-employed or working freelance.Among the initiatives and support schemes under the new Resilience Budget is the Training Support Scheme for the self-employed. Although the Government is currently providing financial support to the self-employed, the opportunity to undergo training must also be highlighted.I hope that the self-employed or freelancers can make use of this opportunity to upgrade their skills and gain relevant knowledge and experience, which will help to improve their chance of getting permanent jobs in the future.At the same time, the launch of the SG United Jobs initiative, which will provide about 10,000 public sector job openings, will present opportunities to those who are looking for permanent employment.I hope that our community can make use of this time and available opportunities to enhance their skills, knowledge and experience, and plan their career wisely.There is a Malay idiom that advises one to “do any job that is available first until something better comes along”.(In English)Mr Deputy Speaker, the COVID-19 outbreak has changed many things and thwarted many plans that we had. In response, the Government has pulled out the stops and introduced extensive and generous assistance packages, schemes and initiatives to help Singaporeans. These will certainly help alleviate the hardships and challenges we face. But individually, we also need to start leveraging on opportunities to upgrade our skills and expertise, continue learning and re-learning, and look for opportunities so that we remain relevant.The COVID-19 outbreak has changed many things, but it is also an opportunity for us to make some much-needed changes ourselves. In the words of Thomas Carlyle, \"Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements and impossibilities: It is this that, in all things, distinguishes the strong from the weak\", and I am confident we will emerge from this crisis even stronger as a nation. I support the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets.7.34 pmMs Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to first thank Deputy Prime Minister Heng and everyone in his team at MOF for the immense amount of work they did to make this Supplementary Budget possible within such a tight timeline.For many of us, these first three months of 2020 have felt like a \"horror suspense\" movie that keeps us anxious and on the edge till the end. Except, we are not watching this movie – we are living it, and we still do not know when is the end and how it would end.Many people – some I know and some I do not – have reached out for help as their lives are turned upside down. An acquaintance almost killed himself last Monday because he has lost all his gigs as an event emcee. A single mother of a young boy, who lives with an elderly mother, has had her salary cut by 50%. Many migrant workers struggle to pay for their daily essentials because there is no more overtime pay to make.Sir, it is hard to fault such a generous Budget trying to avert an economic calamity and save jobs and industry – even lives. Yet, the crisis illuminates long-term cracks that we must address decisively for a good and strong rebound as a nation.Every crisis is an opportunity to observe the cracks, rectify the causes and become more prepared for the future.Mr Deputy Speaker, I will first spotlight the cracks in two areas. First, mental health of our people in this crisis and, second, low-income households who will bear the brunt of the crisis. I will then raise suggestions from the communities that aim to not only cushion the immediate impact of COVID-19 but also future-proof our social and psychological resilience for a more equal and united people.Mr Deputy Speaker, this House is familiar with my call for mental health to inform our Budget and national policies. I was initially alarmed that the Resilience Budget did not allocate any funding and resources to mental healthcare, support and research for this period. I am now slightly relieved that Deputy Prime Minister Heng acknowledged the need for mental health support as part of the national response in the Solidarity Budget announced today. But I do not think we are doing enough. Allow me to elaborate.Pandemics inflict psychological carnage. Pandemics can trigger new psychiatric symptoms even in the healthy. Safe distancing, constant fear and anxiety, the loss of loved ones, job losses, industrial failures will wear down our national psyche.AWARE has received 33% more calls than usual on its Women’s Hotline in the last month, as social isolation measures entrap victims with their abusers. Our senior citizens are left to battle loneliness as community activities cease. A Straits Times report yesterday confirmed that some living with mental illnesses have suffered a relapse or that their conditions have worsened.I also worry for our office-holders and civil servants who bear the weight of spearheading the fight. I read the recent news of the German State Minister’s suicide over COVID-related stress with alarm and sadness.Now, more than ever, we must prioritise mental health support. In fact, a mental health disaster is starting in Wuhan just as the Coronavirus crisis is easing. Prime Minister Lee has said that it might take several years for COVID-19 to run its course. For us, the psychological toll has barely started.Sir, I propose that relevant experts be appointed to join the Multi-Ministry COVID-19 Taskforce to advise the Government on mental health implications and commensurate policy interventions. This proposal has been raised by mental health experts themselves. A Budget should also be set aside without delay to implement public health experts’ recommendations on mental health to avert a further public health crisis.I urge the Government to broadcast through all its publicity channels, practical advice on maintaining mental well-being in various COVID-related situations. The NHS Inform in Scotland dedicates an entire section of their website to this. Guidance should also be published for all employers on supporting their employees’ mental well-being.Sir, this House will recall that I asked MOH atCOSto start a national mental health hotline for distress support. I am relieved that Minister Desmond Lee announced the National CARE Hotline yesterday and he mentioned today as well. I hope it will be strategically designed and implemented to continue beyond this crisis.I also repeat my call made at theCOSthat the Government consider allowing the first mental healthcare consultation for all Singaporeans to be free so as to incentivise help-seeking. We can pilot this during the crisis. We must enable quality mental healthcare and subsidise fees for individuals whose mental health has suffered due to COVID-19, especially for lower income households. More resources must also be funnelled to organisations, such as Samaritans of Singapore, AWARE and Silver Ribbon, whose free counselling services are likely to become strained in the days to come.Last but not least, I urge the Public Services Division to provide the necessary mental health support for all our civil servants and healthcare workers through this intense period.Mr Deputy Speaker, let me now move to the impact of the crisis on lower income households and individuals. I do not underestimate the imminent cash flow struggle that many Singaporeans face – my own friends and family are treading water. But lower income families will suffer more than most.Adam (not his real name) is a hotel cleaner in his 50s. Because of the crisis, he has had no work since 25 March. Beyond Social Services has reported that their members who are disproportionately engaged in low-paid and precarious forms of work have suffered a sharp drop in household income, or lost their jobs altogether.Families like Adam’s live on the edge. Even in good times, he took home about $1,600 each month. One thousand four hundred dollars went to his wife for groceries and household expenses. That amount is not always enough for them and their four young children.Such want is normal in parts of Singapore. In 2018, about 300,000 residents earned less than $2,000 per month. Household expenses for the average Singaporean household in the lowest income quintile have consistently exceeded income for the last 10 years. Twenty-seven thousand of the poorest households in Singapore have, on average, $246 in savings per household member. Our low-wage workers have always been insecure, and this insecurity will be exacerbated in an economic crisis.Unfortunately, the measures announced are not enough to bail out a low-income household that loses its income, especially for those with several dependants. Based on my calculations quickly, Adam will receive $7,632 through the various schemes, including the $600 Solidarity Payment that was announced today. Mr Deputy Speaker, the estimated household expenditure alone for his family for the rest of 2020 is already in excess of $13,000.Sir, it is for such families that we must provide more assistance, more quickly, and for longer. So, I welcome the change to a longer period of assistance of at least six months from the usual one to four months for ComCare Short to Medium Term Assistance.However, application processing times must also improve. Angie (not her real name) is a widow in her 60s who is unfit to work. For one year, she received ComCare Financial Assistance in short tranches and had to apply for renewal at the end of each tranche whilst waiting up to a month for a reply without financial support. For two whole months, she could not afford food, bus fare or essential medical treatment.If processing times are challenging in normal times, they will reach breaking point at crunch time. More than 60,000 applications have been made for the Temporary Relief Fund (TRF) since applications opened last week. I am relieved that we are exercising flexibility and finally allowing for online applications from this week onwards.In addition to getting help to those who need it fast, we must reduce the administrative load on our Social Service Agencies (SSAs) so that they can focus in supporting Singaporeans affected. Given these priorities, we may have to trade off the luxury of deep-diving every case to test its deservedness. For applicants, this also cuts out the need to apply in-person and prove their suffering over and over again.With that, I would like to make two recommendations.First, make automatic disbursement the norm. The Temporary Relief Fund and COVID-19 Support Grant could be automatically disbursed based on self-declaration or proxy indicators, such as changes in CPF contributions.Second, make help unconditional and reduce the amount of evidence required to prove to MSF that the applicant is struggling. Instead, MSF officers could be given the power to investigate end-users whom they suspect are abusing the system.As SSOs struggle with the crunch, families who need their ComCare assistance reviewed will be stuck in financial limbo. I propose extending the TRF and COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) to all these families to ease their cash flow at this time. More immediate relief can also come in the form of HDB rental waivers till the end of 2020 as well as further rebates to S&CC fees.Food security is another big concern, Mr Deputy Speaker, despite the best efforts from charities. For Singaporeans in the lowest income quintile, 49% of income is spent on food. At the same time, F&B businesses are suffering and the Resilience Budget may be insufficient to prevent the industry from going under.Therefore, just as the Government galvanised a multi-sectoral effort with the hotels to accommodate returning Singaporeans for their 14-day self-isolation, I urge the Government to work with the F&B sector and food delivery companies to provide food to all families like Adam's and Angie's for the period of this crisis as a national response, not a fragmented approach like it is now. This has a double advantage. It ensures absolute food security for our lower income households and frees up household liquidity whilst supporting our local F&B businesses and self-employed delivery riders.Mr Deputy Speaker, this crisis highlights the vulnerability of our rental flat communities – my final point in this speech.The very nature of frontline work like Adam's entails a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Adam and his family share 20 square metres of living space in a 1-room rental flat. If he is infected through work or job search, his family will not be spared. Risk of community spread is also high. Their home opens into an enclosed corridor, along which several other families live. Neighbours' children run all around.Infection risk is simply a logical consequence of overcrowding. There is moderate to strong evidence of association between crowded housing and the risk of acquiring respiratory infectious diseases. There are at least 1,425 households where five persons or more are crammed into a 1-room flat. Many more live in 2-room flats. Such crowded living conditions create a ripe environment for infection which in turn could spread to the wider community.The World Health Organization strongly recommends that national strategies be developed and implemented to prevent and reduce household crowding. That includes a national definition of overcrowding. Our vulnerable families should be housed in flats with features to protect public health such as ventilated corridors, rooms to enable distancing and separate elevators serving different floors.Mr Deputy Speaker, the COVID-19 dormitory clusters should alert us to the danger of overcrowding in a pandemic. I wish to record my deep concern regarding the isolation of 20,000 of our migrant workers in these cramped facilities. This must not become the \"Diamond Princess\" on our shores. Alternative and more favourable living arrangements in spaces freed up from the circuit breaker measures must be urgently considered to avoid a large-scale tragedy of infected cases and mortality.We must re-home our most vulnerable in conducive spaces. We may not be able to do that for all during this crisis but we can do it in time for the next, and our people will be more resilient for it.\"All of us are only as strong as our weakest link\", said Prime Minister Lee at the Extraordinary Virtual G20 Leaders' Summit. Indeed, unity is strength, yet inequality is our weakest link in this fight against COVID-19 and to our future as a strong, united Singapore. The short-term measures announced in the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets are essential. Our reserves are meant exactly for times like these. But we must not let a good crisis go to waste. We must boldly address the structural inequalities in wage and housing conditions that are clear and present, made more exigent by this crisis – because Adam and Angie are part of our own – as we must, too, with supporting the mental health of our people in a strategic and comprehensive manner through and beyond this crisis.Mr Deputy Speaker, it is not what happened to us but what we choose to become because of the crisis that will define us as a Government, as a people and as individuals. If we pause and think about all that is going on, it is rather humbling to know how the tiniest of a living organism that cannot even be seen by the naked eye has such power to change us for the better by making us face our fears and flaws so that we can finally see who we are and who we are to each other.It is up to us to choose how this horror suspense movie will end for us as a nation, because this, too, shall pass, and when it does, a more mentally resilient and equal Singapore must and will be what becomes of us.Before I conclude, I want to thank every healthcare worker, civil servant, social worker, community practitioner, volunteer and everyone who has worked tirelessly and selflessly to support fellow Singaporeans and residents affected by COVID-19. But please do take care of your mental well-being. You must not pour from an empty cup, because the work you do is important for us, for Singapore. Sir, I support the Supplementary Budgets.Mr Deputy Speaker: Ms Yip Pin Xiu.7.50 pmMs Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Resilience Budget announced last week to help Singaporeans and businesses emerge stronger showed support for workers and households, stabilising businesses and building our resilience as a country. As we see more and more Singaporeans getting affected by the COVID-19 situation, I am heartened and thankful that the Government has devoted a war chest of $48 billion to help and support Singaporeans. This amount has increased even more with the announcement of the Solidarity Budget today.Today, I would like to touch on three concerns arising from the people around me during this situation.On 3 April, it was announced that to enhance safe distancing measures, Singaporeans were encouraged to stay at home and to generally avoid leaving the house. At supermarkets, it is not uncommon to find people stocking up on their food supplies despite the Government's message that there will be ample supplies. Given the surge in demand, online grocery companies are also facing difficulties in fulfilling orders.Some have resorted to placing limits on the number of items and weight in order to cope with the demand. Taxi and private car hire drivers are allowed to make home deliveries to meet increased demand. However, even with such measures in place, these companies are often very stretched and are not able to cater to more customers when their delivery slots are full.With more Singaporeans encouraged to stay at home, we need to find ways to increase grocery deliveries in order to take the pressure off physical supermarket outlets. When Singaporeans know that delivery slots and essential items on online supermarket platforms are available and not difficult to secure, they will be more assured, hence, alleviating the crowds at physical supermarket locations. More importantly, it will keep more Singaporeans home and safe.The second one is with regards to public transport social distancing during school dismissal hours. With the new measures enforced, schools and Institutes of Higher Learning will be conducting full home-based learning from 8 April onwards. However, when home-based learning stops, we can consider staggering school hours even more, just like how we encourage the staggering of office hours to deal with peak hour traffic on public transports. Currently, public transport is packed with students from different schools during their commute in the morning and when school ends. This has resulted in large crowds in the trains and buses during such periods, contrary to the concept of social distancing, which the Government has been advocating. While it may not be feasible to enforce social distancing on trains, the Government can consider staggering school hours even more to reduce the number of students traveling on public transport at the same time.Lastly, I would like to share my thoughts on sports. Sports has the ability to transcend boundaries and provide immeasurable benefits to one's well-being. Sport Singapore's core purpose is to inspire the Singapore spirit and transform Singapore through sports and they have done well thus far. Behind the scenes, there are many sports enterprises which contribute to the success of Singapore as a vibrant sporting hub. In addition, sports-related activities tend to bring in a large number of participants and spectators from around the world, boosting tourism figures.I have heard from many sports enterprises about the issues they are facing with their businesses in this period. These include sporting event companies, mega gyms, clubs and even social clubs. These companies have been affected since the outbreak of the pandemic in January 2020. And with every new measure being implemented to help flatten the curve, it has been harder for these companies to continue operations given the drop in number of patrons and students of such establishments. Currently, many of them face a huge loss of revenue and to manage their bottom line,cost cutting measures were taken in order for them to stay afloat.Rent and manpower-related issues are the largest component of expenses. Some enterprises received rent relief from their landlords. However, dealing with manpower-related expenses such as salary has been more tricky. In some instances, salaries have been cut in order to minimise the number of layoffs. Since 24 March, where the advisory was to suspend all children and youth-centric sports programmes, most companies are facing zero revenues. When the circuit breaker measures were announced, it was seen that there would be mandatory closures of many sporting establishments on 7 April. These SMEs which are considered \"non-essential services\" will face a larger strain on their finances.After the circuit breaker, if the regulatory measures in the sports sector still remain the same as before the circuit breaker, many companies in this affected sector will still be facing a high loss of revenue, and in some cases, no revenue given that recovery will be a protracted process in light of these disruptions.While the Resilience Budget provided for Job Support Scheme (JSS) support, these SMEs in this sector qualify for 25% on the first $4,600 of monthly salaries. With the Solidarity Budget, the JSS support increases to 75% for the month of April. However, most small and medium-sized sports enterprises require more support as they do not have deep pockets to sustain the business past two months in the current situation.I hope that the Deputy Prime Minister can consider prolonging the increased JSS support past April in order to help these enterprises in this affected sector to retain their employees. With this increased support, our sports enterprises will be able to use the opportunity to focus on re-calibrating their strategies during the downtime and emerge stronger, in a better position, to bring more benefits to Singapore and Singaporeans quicker when the situation improves. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Budgets.Mr Deputy Speaker: Ms Tin Pei Ling.7.57 pmMs Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson): Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Supplementary Budgets.The Resilience and Solidarity Budgets are a very significant addition to this year's Budget. Earlier in February, Deputy Prime Minister Heng announced the Unity Budget that included $6.4 billion worth of measures to cope with COVID-19. With the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets, the total amount set aside to help Singapore and Singaporeans battle COVID-19 is now $59.9 billion – almost a tenfold increase.I am grateful that the Government swiftly and significantly increased the amount of help given.Most of the concerns that residents raised to me at the beginning were addressed in the landmark Resilience Budget and now the Solidarity Budget as well. Cash flow was a key concern for families and businesses I encountered. At my weekly Meet-the-People Session two weeks ago, I recall meeting several self-employed residents whose incomes were drastically reduced because of COVID-19.One such case was a man who is the sole breadwinner of his young family, working as a Grab driver. His wife is medically certified unfit for work. His children are very young, with the youngest being only five months old. He had to take a break earlier in the year after being hit by a car – it was a hit-and-run incident – and upon returning to work, he received few assignments as a result of COVID-19. Most often, he had no cash to take home. That night, he told me his children had been hungry for the entire day and were waiting for him to bring food home. Of course, we immediately went to the 24-hour FairPrice nearby, and bought them groceries and milk powder to tide through the night. We disbursed local ComCare the next day and enrolled the children in our milk powder programme.Hence, when I hear of the cash assistance being tripled and the introduction of various schemes such as the grocery vouchers, Temporary Relief Fund and Self-Employed Income Relief Scheme, I was very happy. I know families like the one I just described will benefit from these measures. The only request that I had at that time was to have the help disbursed sooner than later, and therefore in today's Solidarity Budget, I am pleased that some of the most essential help will be delivered within this month, much sooner than expected. Thank you.These enhanced measures, amongst others, such as the one-year waiver of Government fees and charges, and reprieve from loan repayments, will increase cash flow for them and over a more sustained period of time.To fund these help measures, the Government will have to, for the second time in our post-Independence history, withdraw up to $17 billion from our reserves and we can expect a total fiscal deficit of about $44.3 billion in this financial year. Just to get a sense of proportion, this deficit alone is more than half of last year's total public expenditure! I must say that our Government and leaders have been very focused, single-mindedly, wholeheartedly, battling this COVID-19.And as we thought that we have gained grounds in battling down this COVID-19, I think, all of the sudden, we realise that there is a spike in the infection cases. It is almost as if we have been working so hard to keep our house in order but because of what is happening around us, around the world, we are seeing this spike of infection. I can only imagine how demoralising it could be for our frontliners, for all the Government officials, the social workers, everyone, who have been involved in this fight. And therefore, I must express my deepest appreciation and gratitude to all of you who have worked so hard. And I feel that personally, when I see the measures being introduced, it is almost as if whenever we see a new problem appeared or a new gap that has emerged, immediately, our Government will find the resources to go and plug that gap and help Singaporeans to tide through. I feel that this sincerity is something that we can see and I hope that all Singaporeans will be able to appreciate this. This is a very extraordinary time and we must continue to stand together to render our support.Therefore, with all of these funds put aside to help Singaporeans, I think this is a very decisive move and a much needed one.As we battle this unprecedented crisis, I am thankful that our past and present leaders have been judicious in managing our reserves, painstakingly saving up for \"storms\" like this and resisted siren calls in the past to spend our reserves. Because of this, we can now confidently dip in to help Singaporeans.Extraordinary time calls for extraordinary measures. About two months have passed since we had our first COVID-19 case and the economic consequences are already dire. We now have an extremely generous package to battle the virus. But with the pandemic expected to last for up to a year or more, I wonder how many more packages we will need and how much more might we have to dip into our reserves for.As much as I believe it is necessary for us to draw on our reserves to help Singapore and Singaporeans get through this storm, I wonder if this is also the beginning of a long slippery slope down. Will we have enough to leave behind for our future generations? How do we moderate ourselves and is there a red line beyond which we shall not draw further from our reserves?Essentially, how can we sustain help and at the same time, not deplete this pot of gold for our children and theirs?In a crisis of this scale, Government's intervention is critical. But we must also not diminish the power of individuals. All of us have the power to help and contribute towards a sustainable future for the next generation.Over the past months, we saw various ground up initiatives, such as sourcing and distributing masks and hand sanitisers to the elderly. In recent weeks, we continue to see Singaporeans coming forth to offer ideas and support. Take, for instance, when the application for Temporary Relief Fund commenced, Community Centres were overwhelmed on the first day. A call for volunteers to help with form filling and crowd management saw many responded. Similarly, we now have volunteers who have stepped forth to man the reusable mask collection centres. Others took their own initiative to collate and circulate lists of useful official websites offering critical information during this period of information explosion. This helps Singaporeans to get the right information from the right channel and in a most timely manner. Because of these big-hearted Singaporeans who volunteered, we have been able to pool community resources, close gaps and do more for those who need help.But the potential for individuals to play a part is more than this. If there is a silver lining to this crisis, it is the opportunity for us to show our solidarity, transform our capabilities and strengthen our resilience.Most immediately, as we approach the \"circuit breaker\" starting tomorrow, we should all stay home and do whatever we must to encourage our family and friends to stay home. Simply, if we do not cooperate and the spread worsens, this one month \"breaker\" and the pain that everyone must endure will be a wasted sacrifice. We will then have to draw from our reserves further and leave even lesser for our future generations. So, care for yourself, care for others, stay home to show our solidarity with those on the frontline.Secondly, affected Singaporeans can make use of the downtime and Government incentives to train and upskill, so that we are ready to take on new jobs after the recovery. At the Temporary Relief Fund applications at the Community Club, I observed that a number of applicants who lost their jobs or suffer reduced work do not wish to take up skills training, despite the incentives. The hesitance is understandable as they are preoccupied with the immediate challenges and as they still harbour hopes that they can return to their jobs once this crisis \"blows over\". However, I would urge that we keep the \"big picture\" in mind. Even without this COVID-19, the advent of digital economy is certain. So, why not take this opportunity to get ourselves ready for that inevitable future?Similarly, enterprises of all sizes can take this opportunity to transform. As companies get hit by COVID-19, many realised that they were not ready to offer their services and products online. As a result, their businesses are disrupted. Taking the enrichment education sector for example, I came across an informal survey by a fledgling platform company Beecraft. Nine out 10 of the companies in the enrichment/education sector surveyed reported low technology adoption, meaning that they have been predominantly using the traditional means of teaching. Anecdotally elsewhere, I hear of similar feedback. Amongst those surveyed, they cited financial support being most important in helping them drive their digitalisation effort. Government funding is available. Hon colleagues in this House will know of the many schemes that IMDA offers. With COVID-19, the imperative for digital transformation cannot be any clearer. Just as it is an opportunity for the IMDA to step in and catalyse the transformation, I hope companies will take this opportunity to make use of the support available and up their own game.This is a period of great many adjustments. Government is adjusting, so are businesses and people. We are heading into the \"circuit breaker\" for at least a month.I am glad that our thoughtful Government made sure that essential services will continue so that life can go on. But we also need to reduce the need for interactions and administrative load on some of our public agencies.Based on case trends at our weekly Meet-the-People Sessions, mainly mine, could financial assistances, including ComCare and MediFund that are expiring during this \"circuit breaker\" period be automatically renewed for another month? Could the social visit passes and long-term visit passes of Singaporeans' foreign family members that will be expiring in this period also be automatically renewed for another month?In essence, could Government processes that typically see high public interface be adjusted so that Singaporeans in need may have peace of mind as we all hunker down during this period?(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, the global economy is tumbling drastically. To cope with the dire economic situation, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced three Budgets within a short span of two months, namely, Unity, Resilience and Solidarity Budget, totalling $59.9 billion, to help Singaporeans deal with the outbreak. This is the largest Budget since Independence, roughly 11% of our GDP. The series of packages are timely, for individuals, families, workers and businesses. We can do so because our Government has been planning for rainy days over the years, allowing us to acquire this economic capability.Our reserves are strategic assets accumulated over a long time. Generations of Singapore leaders have been practising fiscal prudence to achieve sustainable economic growth. Although faced with political pressure, the Government has been upholding the principle of tapping on reserves only during extraordinary times. As the pandemic worsens and creates multiple external shocks, economic activities have also been affected. At this critical moment, the Government drew decisively on reserves to stimulate the economy. This is what the people need.However, the battle against COVID-19 will be long-drawn and the unprecedented fiscal expenditure has also caused some concerns. Is there a mechanism under the current reserves safeguard framework to define how we can effectively use the reserves and the amount? On one hand, the amount must be sufficient to allow the Government to alleviate the situation; on the other hand, we must also ensure that our future generations will have enough funds to cope with future expenditures so that they are not left with nothing.With the unexpected advent of COVID-19, we have seen many community organisations voluntarily make and distribute reusable masks for the elderly and the vulnerable. We have also seen many Singaporeans express their sincere gratitude to frontline healthcare workers, encouraging them. This demonstrates the warmth in our society and is commendable.Besides the Government, public agencies and communities, businesses and individuals should also play their part. During this period, we must first take care of our own health and stay at home. This is the best contribution you can make to the country now. Ensuring our own health is the best we can do for our healthcare workers, allowing them to see the light at the end of the tunnel and take a breather. Taking care of our health can also reduce the need to tap on our reserves. This is being accountable to our future generations.During this period, Singaporeans should make use of the Adapt and Grow Scheme as well as other schemes to undergo training, upgrade skills and be prepared for economic recovery. With the outbreak, businesses should also recognise the importance of digital transformation, use resources wisely and take the opportunity to transform and strengthen capabilities, and innovate continuously to stay competitive.Over the weekend, I took a walk in the hawker centre and talked to the residents. Many of them were feeling a bit worried about the closing down of non-essential services, but they showed understanding nevertheless. I think the more difficult the situation is, the more resilient Singaporeans should be. This is a chance to demonstrate our strength. I believe as long as we are united and uphold our Singapore Spirit of solidarity, we will eventually beat this virus and emerge stronger.(In English): Over the weekend, I was at the hawker centres in MacPherson. Many were concerned about the impending \"circuit breaker\". But almost everyone understood the need and agreed that we should all cooperate, bite the bullet and rough it out for this one month. Almost every conversation ended with a \"加油\". If we can do this together, we can overcome and emerge stronger. Singapore Together, Singapore United. 新加坡，加油！Mr Deputy Speaker: Ms Joan Pereira.8.13 pmMs Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank Deputy Prime Minister and the MOM for broadening the criteria of allowing our self-employed persons (SEPs) earning an income as an employee to also qualify for Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS). This was the point that I had wanted to bring up and appeal and I am happy for the adjustment.The Resilience and Solidarity Budget demonstrates the Government's determination and resolve to minimise the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on jobs and the economy as best as it can. I would like to make some suggestions based on the feedback from my residents over the course of the week.The first is to lower the age for auto-inclusion for SIRS. Automatic payout is given to eligible SEPs aged 37 and above. Would the Government consider including SEPs aged 30 and above as well? At that age, Singaporeans would be planning for marriage or would be married with a child on the way or have at least a child to support. Some of their parents or in-laws might be retired and need their support too. Hence, allowing for auto-inclusion from 30 years old and above will greatly help to relieve the burden on affected families and also reduce the administrative workload on Government officers so that they can devote more resources to other urgent appeals.Second, some unemployed residents hope to qualify for the COVID-19 Support Grant, which was targeted at employees who lost their jobs due to the contagion. While they had not lost their jobs earlier due to COVID-19, the crisis has definitely made their ongoing search for jobs much harder. I feel that as long as they are actively looking for jobs, whether these are permanent or part-time positions or on fixed term contracts, or are still attending training, they should be also assisted under this scheme.Second, some unemployed residents hope to qualify for the COVID-19 Support Grant, which was targeted at employees who lost their jobs due to the contagion.

The Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) will help the self-employed to cope with the current difficulties.I would like to suggest that the SIRS auto-qualifying age be reduced to 30. Those who had lost their jobs even before the outbreak also appeal to the Government to accommodate them, so that they can receive the COVID-19 Support Grant, too.(In English): With stricter safe distancing measures and the greater vulnerability of our seniors, we would want our elderly to stay at home more. How can we ensure that our needy seniors or seniors living alone can get the help they need? How is the Government empowering VWOs to pool their resources to assist them, such as helping them to buy groceries or sending meals to them? Could we make better use of technology in this area?I support the Resilience and Solidarity Budget and its measures to help our workers and the unemployed. There will be some who might fall through the cracks and need to be given special consideration in view of their particular circumstances. I trust that our leaders would exercise due diligence and flexibility. I support the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets.8.17 pmMs Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong): Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Allow me to begin my speech in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]The COVID-19 crisis has evolved so rapidly and shaken us to the core. This situation drove our Government to act swiftly and issue new regulations and legislation to contain the spread of this outbreak. At the same time, the Government also coordinated support to assist those who are facing the fallout from this crisis.This began with the Unity Budget which was then supplemented with the Resilience Budget. Today, Deputy Prime Minister Heng announced the Solidarity Budget. The Government also gave a commitment that there will be a sustained effort to help those facing difficulties due to the COVID-19 crisis.The impact of this crisis is becoming clear and we can see many people from various job sectors being affected. Within the Malay/Muslim community, those affected include Geylang Serai bazaar entrepreneurs and the asatizah.Many Malay/Muslim workers, families and students also face challenges arising from this crisis.I think we need to have a targeted approach to assist the Malay/Muslim community and mobilise the resources within our community, like the Malay/Muslim bodies, to come up with holistic support. Therefore, I am heartened that the SGTeguhBersatu team was set up to ensure that the COVID-19 national assistance schemes will reach our community. I am also glad to be involved in this task force.I see opportunities for many of our community members to go to the ground and work hand-in-hand to help everyone ride through these difficult times.For instance, one group that I am concerned with are the young people who are about to complete their studies and enter the workforce. It is likely that they will face difficulties getting suitable jobs with good pay. Observers have said that the graduating Class of 2020 will be affected beyond the duration of this crisis. Their careers and income potential may be affected throughout their lifetime.Therefore, there has to be sustained efforts to help them so that they can use this difficult period to continue upskilling and enhance their competitiveness. In this regard, the Government has announce the SGUnited Traineeship Programmes and the SGUnited Jobs Initiative. These efforts can help new graduates gain employment. We must also ensure that young Malay/Muslims are aware of these available opportunities and make use of them. At the same time, I feel that Malay/Muslim bodies like MENDAKI and AMP can also play their part to strengthen support for these young people, perhaps through their available programmes. MENDAKI, for instance, has the Future-Ready and mentoring programmes that can be enhanced to supplement the Government’s efforts.In conclusion, I feel that the Government has announced many efforts to reduce the challenges that are being experienced by people from all walks of life. The Malay/Muslim community can be helped to seize available opportunities and can continue receiving support using the resources within our own community. May these efforts help us overcome any challenges that come our way together and continue to contribute to the economic recovery and development of Singapore.(In English): Just a few days ago, I met a resident seeking some assistance as he had lost his job in the midst of this COVID-19 crisis. He seemed disheartened but not defeated, and we spoke about the various support measures available. He was the last resident I was meeting for the night and I heard a child’s voice as he walked out of my Branch. His wife and son were waiting for him outside. I walked out too and saw a familiar face saying hello to me. I had met the boy just a few weeks back when I sent some cupcakes over to his pre-school because we had cancelled the regular birthday celebrations. He was lively and happy, innocent and clearly oblivious to the challenges his parents were facing.It hit me how much things had changed since I last met the little boy, how fast things have become a lot more challenging in just a few weeks. The issues his father is facing is not unique and I have met many residents in similar situations.At one point, especially before the announcement of the Resilience Budget, I was feeling rather helpless because people were really struggling and I was concerned if enough is being done to help them.The extensive $48 billion Resilience Budget therefore came as a much welcomed relief. Many felt that the measures were generous and gave much hope to different groups of people within the community. Details of the specific measures have come in and we have started to roll out some of these measures like the Temporary Relief Fund.However, the challenges brought forth by COVID-19 is multi-faceted and the Government needs to also step in with various new legislation to make the system work. For example, the proposed new law to compel landlords to pass on property tax rebate to tenants and the proposed law to provide relief to parties with contractual obligations and have difficulties performing them because of COVID-19.It has become even more stark, in the past few days that the worst is not over. Numbers of those infected by COVID-19 continue to rise and the Government has had to announce further measures, in particular the circuit breaker, to protect our people. This will bring many things to a standstill and cause massive disruption to our routine affairs. Construction projects cannot proceed, cases in Court would have to be postponed and more businesses and more individuals will be affected further as non-essential services have to be shut down. I am therefore heartened that the Government has announced the Solidarity Budget to augment the existing support and, in particular, to address the side effects of the circuit breaker.There are so many aspects of life that would be affected especially in light of the recent measures, I would therefore like to ask how the Government plans to manage all the knock-on effects of the crisis. Would there be a coordinated effort to assess the challenges faced by the different sectors and come up with a recovery plan? Are there lessons we could learn from the lockdown in other countries?Further, it is apparent that more funds would have to be injected to continue to support businesses, individuals and families affected by the disruption. Deputy Prime Minister Heng has announced that he has gotten in-principle approval from President Halimah Yacob to draw down a further $4 billion from our Reserves on top of the earlier $17 billion dollars that was approved.I would like to ask if this will be something sustainable and what is the Government’s assessment now on our fiscal ability to weather this massive storm?I am truly grateful for the stewardship of the Government as we navigate through these challenging, unchartered waters. I have always been so proud of being Singaporean but now more than ever, I am proud to be part of this great nation.It has been oft said that this is the crisis for this generation. We may not have to physically go to the battlefield and pick up weapons to fight the enemy. But we have our own burden to bear and we will do this together. SGUnited is one of the taglines we have chosen to capture the spirit of togetherness. Let it not be mere lip service but an actual effort by all of us to do our part. Employers should tap on Government support like the Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme to retain their employees and let them continue to earn a living. Employees need to be understanding and help support the businesses where necessary so that there will still be a job to go to after this crisis is over. Landlords should work alongside tenants to help them retain the premises and pass on the property tax rebates to their tenants. Let us not take advantage of each other and give indulgence to each other where possible. We definitely have this compassion in us, as can be seen from the numerous ground-up initiatives by Singaporeans. I have heard of businesses and young people from different academic institutions banding together to put up a list of job and internship opportunities to help their peers who have had their overseas internships and studies cut short due to COVID-19. I have seen Facebook posts from people personally offering to cook or give food to those who may be struggling during this period, so one would never go hungry. These efforts are heartening.The COVID-19 crisis has brought about carnage but, at the same time, also allowed for many good things to blossom. This crisis is pushing us to do all the things we know we should have been doing but have resisted for so long.Some of us have championed flexible work arrangements and asked employers to allow for opportunities to work from home. There was much inertia but now, we are pushed to look at digital solutions and make it happen. We have spoken about wanting to make Singapore clean, educate people with better social habits, how we want to be like Japan. Now, public hygiene has come to the forefront and we have the opportunity with SGClean to make this vision a reality. For the longest time, we have wanted people to use their own containers to buy food from stalls or restaurants. Now, we have been pushed to do so more pervasively as the \"tabao\" option will be a common feature.Like many Singaporeans, I am anxious and overwhelmed with all that is happening. However, I am also hopeful as I have faith in the strength of this leadership and the compassion and resilience of the people. Let us make the best of this crisis, learn the important lessons from the challenges that come our way and emerge stronger as a nation. Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Supplementary Budgets."

        "Content": "The Chairman: Head O, Ministry of Health. Dr Chia Shi-Lu.A United Healthcare System for AllDr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar): Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head O of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".This year's Budget aside from the understandable focus on the evolving COVID-19 situation, has emphasised the importance of staying united and advancing forward as one people, to meet the challenges of the next decade and beyond. This is a strategy that should be applied to healthcare planning as well. And we have to come together as one people to think, to talk, to act and to prepare our country for the health challenges we face as we move towards 2030 and beyond.The human body works well if all of its various component parts – the cells, the tissues and the organs – work together. Disease and illness occur if one or more of these parts lose their close cooperation and their balance with other parts. The traditional model for the practice of medicine involves a close but often exclusive doctor-patient relationship, although not always with the same unity of purpose.Health and healthcare policies in the past have also often proceeded on a typically prescriptive and directive approach, presumably because there is often a fair degree of information asymmetry, and also because admittedly, many of us could not always be relied on to make the right choices for our personal health.The Healthcare 2020 Masterplan that was enunciated by MOH in 2012 outlined clear goals in terms of healthcare quality, affordability and accessibility, and put forward concrete, quantitative objectives in terms of manpower, infrastructure and financial targets.12.30 pmBut health is not simply a numbers game and I was very supportive of more recent announcements by MOH that encouraged a mindset and strategic shifts. Just as whole-of-Government actions are needed to tackle complex issues confronting our country, a whole-of-society approach would be needed to cover that last hundred yards in our healthcare journey. And in order to do this, we really need the unity of purpose amongst all Singaporeans. This is certainly something that is not easy to achieve and certainly very difficult to budget for.Singapore's response to the COVID-19 situation is a timely illustration of the importance of societal unity to meet medical shocks. Many commentators have commented favourably on the quality of our disease preparedness planning, healthcare facilities, medical manpower, contact tracing, border controls and so on, and allow me to join my Parliamentary colleagues to put on record my sincere appreciation for the sacrifices that all frontline personnel, whether medical or otherwise, have made since the situation unfolded from the start of the year.But one of the key elements to the success of the strategy is community involvement and how the whole of Singaporean society has come together to face this challenge. This is one critical element that Prof Dale Fisher, who was part of the WHO-China mission to Wuhan, noted as one key reason why China seems to be succeeding in controlling this outbreak and why Singapore is likewise having some success in managing the outbreak thus far. And such community involvement would likewise be critical if we are to succeed in winning other wars we have, for example, the war on diabetes, on controlling dengue, bringing smoking rates down and getting everyone to eat better, sleep better and exercise more.At this juncture, I would like to ask the Minister for an update of whether it is \"mission accomplished\" for Healthcare 2020. Further to this, I would like to ask the Ministry what updates have been made to our national vision for healthcare in the coming decade and beyond? How can we work together to encourage each and every one of us to work together towards common health objectives?Some of the major shifts that the Ministry had announced were to shift care from hospital to the community and to move from healthcare to health. I believe that this can be facilitated by rethinking some of our basic models of healthcare delivery and I hope that the planning of future healthcare facilities like polyclinics and hospitals will consider new models of care, with better integration and interaction between healthcare and community stakeholders.The newly established Alexandra Hospital, which serves many of my residents from Queenstown, has piloted new care delivery models where patients are looked after by a team of healthcare professionals grouped functionally rather than by medical specialty. The hospital also provides novel community outreach programs, for example, we have a free, regular bus shuttle services from the nearby neighbourhoods which they serve to the hospital. The hospital itself may be old and some parts are even heritage properties, but the way it functions is very much at the cutting edge of healthcare service provision.I foresee that there will be increasing disruptions to the way healthcare is delivered and consumed. Hopefully, these disruptions would mostly be beneficial by improving efficiency and improving quality and accessibility and in this way, reducingcosts as well as manpower requirements.I have previously asked about progress on integrating data analytics and perhaps even personalised medicine into our healthcare ecosystem and would like to ask if the Ministry has any updates on this front.I believe that fostering a united, whole-of-society approach to health, would require better health information accessibility and integration. The excellent system of information dissemination during the COVID-19 crisis by battling disinformation and misinformation has certainly contributed much to controlling the outbreak and maintaining societal confidence in the measures the Government is taking.Does the Minister have any updates on the roll-out of the National Electronic Health Records system?Next, an ageing population portends that a greater proportion of the health seeking population may have physical or cognitive impairments that makes it difficult for them to physically access health services. If you are old, your eyesight is not so good, you have trouble moving, it may be more difficult for you to go to your nearby polyclinic or hospital. Outbreaks like COVID-19 also bring into stark relief the benefits that telemedicine or remote medicine and remote consultation can bring.I would like to ask whether there any updates on how telemedicine or remote medicine can be promoted and facilitated in Singapore?Finally, as a nation, we have made great strides in our healthcare system and indeed, in our health, over the past decade. Our excellent performance by most measures, paradoxically means that it becomes harder and harder to make meaningful improvements in the future, as quality of our health is a more nuanced assessment than looking at crude rates like life expectancy or disease burden.Nonetheless, I believe that a united society will be a key piece to this puzzle, and I look forward to the Ministry of Health's stewardship in this regard. May we all live long, live well and grow old together as one people. Thank you, and I beg to move.Question proposed.Healthcare 2020, Quality and AffordabilityMr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah): The Healthcare 2020 Masterplan aimed for improvements in accessibility, affordability and quality of healthcare. These included plans to build new, general and community hospitals, increase the number of subsidised drugs and to make primary healthcare more affordable and accessible through the Community Healthcare Assist Scheme (CHAS) and also the building of new polyclinics.Indeed, the COVID-19 outbreak has put into focus the high quality of healthcare system. Our healthcare workforce has truly shown courage and determination. Would there be further investment needed in the healthcare system, over and above the 2020 goals so as to have the extra capacity needed to deal with a future outbreak, if one was to occur?Healthcare 2030Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson): MOH has achieved progress in many aspects of our public healthcare in the past decade. During my nine years in Parliament so far, I have witnessed many measures introduced to enhance senior care capacity and capability, improve public healthcare affordability, increase healthcare manpower, enhance healthcare accessibility, war on diabetes and many other schemes to promote healthy living.And of course, in most recent times, a very successful campaign against COVID-19. And I hope that we can continue in this aspect.With so much done and taking stock, I would like to ask the Minister if we have achieved what we set out to achieve at the beginning of the Healthcare 2020 masterplan? Now that we are in 2020, what is the Ministry's vision for the next decade? How hopeful can we be in moving from \"curative\" healthcare to \"preventive\" healthcare?Progress of War on DiabetesMr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied): Sir, a year before the Minister of Health declared War on Diabetes, four years ago, the International Diabetes Foundation reported that Singapore had the second highest proportion of diabetics among developed nations. Our children and young people were increasingly overweight. One in three Singaporeans had a lifetime risk of developing diabetes, with serious andcostly consequences.Following the declaration of War on Diabetes, the Prime Minister spoke of diabetes as one of the three key long-term issues for Singapore.Sir, the importance to Singapore of the War on Diabetes cannot be overstated. Could the Minister give us a report of progress from the front? What are the results and lessons? What are our new and continuing efforts and plans; strategies and tactics?Living with COVID-19Dr Chia Shi-Lu: Sir, our efforts in tackling the COVID-19 outbreak have shown good results and won plaudits from around the world. WHO had shared that it was \"very impressed\" with our measures. Dr Zhang Wenhong (张文宏), Director of the Infectious Diseases Department at China's Fudan University, even drew parallels between our healthcare strategies with the famed Wudang (武当) martial art fighting techniques.Would the Ministry provide an update on the COVID-19 situation? What are our contingency preparations in readiness for possible scenarios ahead? Specifically, what are our plans should community transmission within Singapore become more widespread or the evolving pandemic worsen, increasing the risk or reported infections once again. Have we considered the scenarios in which the virus becomes endemic? How then can we learn to leave with the virus?Globally, many healthcare workers at the frontline have been infected while caring for patients and some have even lost their lives though fortunately, not to the same extent as was seen with SARS. What actions are being taken to enhance protection for our frontline healthcare workers.Finally, I note that contact tracing is a key pillar in our containment strategy and recent studies have also suggested that early detection improves survival from the disease. I know recent cases in Singapore where individuals have been charged for being evasive about the movements.Is the Ministry considering expanded powers to access location and other related data from mobile devices of patients and close contacts for contact tracing? South Korea for instance has enacted laws after the MERS crisis in 2015 on managing the information of patients in an infectious disease outbreak.COVID-19Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied): Sir, I have several residents who are COVID-19 patients and our thoughts are with all patients for strength and a speedy recovery.On the treatment front, a resident who was a SARS patient told me that a medical team visited her recently to obtain some blood samples to aid the COVID-19 cases. Some medical experts overseas have opined that using convalescent blood plasma from former SARS patients could assist very sick COVID-19 patients but was unlikely to be deployable on a larger scale. Could Ministry elaborate on the thinking and efforts on this front?As for containment, the World Health Organization has opined that it would take 18 months to develop a safe vaccine. As the virus is assessed to be spread by droplets at close range, containing the spread via separation measures like quarantine appears to be appropriate. What are the preliminary assessments of the effectiveness of the Government's strategy so far?COVID-19 - Planning for Future ThreatsMr Christopher de Souza: Singapore has a formidable healthcare force – the manner in which the COVID-19 outbreak is being dealt with reflects the dedication and professionalism of our healthcare workers. How is a precedent – a standard operating procedure of sorts – being presently developed by the Ministry such that the current operational experiences can be referenced by future healthcare workers in the event of a future outbreak of similar or different magnitude? This will bolster our fight in any future outbreak.Healthcare FinancingDr Chia Shi-Lu: Chairman, our healthcare spending is expected to jump 16.2% this year. The increase of $1.9 billion will go to fund higher subsidies and contingency measures for the COVID-19 outbreak. With our ageing population and the increasing burden of chronic diseases, will Government subsidies be able to keep pace with ever rising medical expenditures? At $13.4 billion this year, healthcare is the second highest expenditure after defence. How will MOH ensure that our healthcare expenditure remains sustainable?MediSave, which is one of the central pillars of our healthcare financing system, is meant to provide for bigger medical expenses such as hospitalisation, day surgery and also outpatient expenses. However, very often, surgeries and hospital stays could be averted with early detection and intervention. If we could encourage more Singaporeans to work closely with their primary care providers, take preventive measures and actively monitor their medical conditions to arrest or slow their progress, we would be able to cut our healthcare expenditure significantly.Hence, would the Ministry consider implementing measures to further reduce out-of-pocket expenses for primary carecosts, including liberalising MediSave for more categories of outpatient expenses or fine-tuning, tweaking some of the existing Flexi-MediSave systems?The principle of co-payment underpins our healthcare financing system. It was meant to encourage prudent and responsible use of healthcare resources to motivate Singaporeans to stay healthy. However, for the elderly, it is more challenging for them to keep illnesses at bay. Many of them worry that even with Government subsidies, they might have difficulty affording the co-payment component of some of the medical expenses.  How does MOH plan to keep healthcare affordable for Singaporeans, particularly for senior citizens? Thank you.Enhanced Flexi-MediSave for SeniorsMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Out-of-pocket expenses for medical care when our seniors enter their 60s can be a source of significant insecurity. Sir, I have previously called for the Ministry to consider a differentiated ceiling for MediSave withdrawals.In 2018, about 16% of individuals fully utilised their Flexi-Medisave limits. Sir, this percentage appears small but it translates to about 136,000 Singaporeans who have fully utilised their yearly $200 limit. We also know from previous Parliamentary replies over the years that elderly patients above 60 years of age with chronic conditions visited polyclinics and CHAS clinics an average of six times a year, with an average annual bill of $200 after subsidies.Those without chronic illnesses visited these healthcare facilities on average about three times a year, with an average annual bill of about $60 after subsidies. I believe there is scope to increase the Flexi-MediSave limits, particularly those who have larger outpatient bills.12.45 pmSir, calls for greater liberalisation of MediSave withdrawals have been made by my colleagues including Mr Faisal Manap. The Workers' Party acknowledges that higher withdrawal limits based on MediSave balances must be carefully considered as it may result in some Singaporeans having less MediSave savings through retirement. However, each senior Singaporean's situation is different, particularly in view of differing MediSave balances across seniors in the population.In addition, Sir, a differentiated ceiling for seniors has been replicated for other MediSave schemes. For example, from this year, a differentiated MediSave withdrawal scheme has been introduced for Singaporeans with long-term care needs. Individuals with $20,000 or more in their MediSave account will be allowed to use $200 each month or $2,400 per year from MediSave for long-term care. Singaporeans with balances of between $15,000 and above are allowed to $150 per month, and so forth.Apart from increasing the Flexi-MediSave limits for outpatient treatment, the additional flexibility in the form of a differentiated ceiling should also be considered to allow for inpatient co-payments that have to be paid in cash after MediSave deductions, particularly as our seniors grow older.While MediShield Life and existing MediSave withdrawals can be utilised for inpatient bills, many patients are still required to make out-of-pocket payments in cash because of existing MediSave limits.Sir, seniors should not be prevented from relying on their MediSave again to settle the cash component of their bills provided their MediSave amounts are healthy.Just this Monday at my Meet-the-People Session (MPS), I saw a resident who asked me to write to the authorities to allow his 75-year-old brother – unemployed and living alone – to utilise around $1,400 from his MediSave to settle his hospitalisation bills. He showed me his brother's CPF statement and the amount stood in excess of $51,000. Sir, this is a man in his mid-70s and unemployed. Surely, there is further scope to further assist our seniors and reduce their out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare-related expenditure.This is not a call for additional subsidies that impact the healthcare budget but a better calibrated MediSave regime that allows our seniors to better manage theircost of living concerns and give them a greater peace of mind.MediFund for Transportation FeeMr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied): Sir, MediFund Scheme is meant to financially assist Singaporeans who have difficulties with their medical expenses for both inpatient and outpatient treatments. It is made available at polyclinics islandwide as well as the restructured hospitals.I would like to call upon MOH to allow the use of MediFund for reimbursement of transport fare for needy Singaporeans, who need to travel by taxi or private hire car to and fro their medical appointments due to their poor health conditions. A good example is stroke patients.I have encountered residents who defaulted their medical appointments especially those who have multiple appointments in a month, as they are too weak to travel by bus or train, and they do not have the financial means to take a taxi or private hire car to ferry them.Sir, this segment of our fellow Singaporeans are usually those who are unemployed due to their medical conditions and they depend heavily or solely on financial assistance, such as ComCare, and handouts from relatives and friends, which amount they received is only sufficient, and in some cases, not even enough for their monthly sustenance.I do know of Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) that offer subsidies for private ambulance fee to needy individuals. However, this subsidised fee is still too high and unaffordable for some.Sir, MediFund Scheme is to ensure that needy Singaporeans are not being deprived of their rights to medical treatments due to their financial standings. Allowing MediFund Scheme to be used for reimbursement of transport fare will surely ease the financial struggles and, more importantly, will enhance the accessibility of medical treatments for this group.The Chairman: Ms Tin Pei Ling, you can take both cuts.MediSave and Healthcare FinancingMs Tin Pei Ling: In my cut earlier, I mentioned that public healthcare affordability has improved over the years that I have seen in this House. It has. But in the course of my constituency work, I still meet many middle-age and senior residents who continue to worry about healthcarecosts.One of the issues they face is not being able to use more of their MediSave to pay for their medical bills, forcing them to make out-of-pocket payments. This poses a cashflow challenge to them. A common argument I have heard from affected residents is that they still have savings in their MediSave, so why can they not use more of their own money for their own treatments? Attempts to explain how CPF works cannot be the same as how a private bank account works were futile as they have immediate needs to solve.I have a resident, Mr Tay, who has a strong sense of self-pride and self-reliance. He needs to seek heart treatments regularly. While his wife and children are financially independent and he has a good relationship with them, he is highly reluctant to ask them to support his medical expenses. He argues for more use of his MediSave beyond the current annual cap so that he can pay for his own needs.While I personally believe that children who can afford it, should support parents, I respect his fierce sense of self-reliance. Therefore, can the MOH consider increasing the flexibility of and annual cap on the use of MediSave?Can we also conscientiously target our publicity and social outreach to encourage children with means to take the initiative to top up parents’ Medisave and Ordinary savings so that their parents need not feel the burden of having to ask their children for money? There is no guarantee that the children will comply but it is a social signal that we should actively send.Also, the community can play a role in raising resources to support seniors who need help with their medical expenses. Would MOH consider a matching fund to boost the funds raised for this purpose?Finally, I urge the Ministry to consider expanding the list of chronic diseases that are eligible for use of MediSave.I once met a relatively young resident during my block visit, about my age or younger. He suffers from severe eczema, highly uncomfortable, and has difficulties finding or holding down jobs. His parents are working but they are just typical 3-roomers and they worry about how they could continue to finance his skin treatments as they age. It is a struggle for them and certainly tormenting for the young man himself. Statistically, an estimated 13% of Asians suffer from eczema.Therefore, could the Ministry review the list of chronic diseases under the Chronic Disease Management Programme and consider including chronic conditions such as eczema?Healthcare CapacityI serve in the MacPherson SMC, a 52-year-old community. Together with the Marine Parade GRC and Mountbatten SMC, the Marine Parade Cluster has seen an average increase of 11% in our senior population from 2016 to 2019. This is a significant rise.As such, healthcare demand will also rise. Studies have shown that the elderly are four times more likely to be hospitalised than younger Singaporeans. Therefore, what is MOH’s plan to expand capacity in eastern Singapore to cope with the anticipated increase and demand for healthcare? With a rapidly ageing population across Singapore, what are MOH’s plans beyond 2020 to keep care accessible for all Singaporeans?The Chairman: Dr Chia Shi-Lu, you can take both cuts.Raising Capacity for an Ageing PopulationDr Chia Shi-Lu: Thank you, Chairman. One-third of the patients admitted into hospital here in Singapore were aged 65 and above and this ratio is set to rise year on year. By 2050, almost half of our population will be in this age group. As the elderly are four times more likely than younger Singaporeans to be hospitalised, there will be much greater demand for hospital beds.Would the Ministry share an update on how it will ensure that we have enough capacity in our hospitals, the corresponding number of healthcare professionals and other necessary medical resources?I would also like to ask the Minister if he has the capacity projections for our various healthcare institutions in the next 10, 20 and 30 years. These include general hospitals, community hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, day care and eldercare centres and, very importantly, day rehabilitation and dementia day care centres. What are MOH's plans to keep this care accessible?Another one of my concerns is how we can better regulate and balance the capacity growth in public versus private healthcare institutions. Is there room for closer collaboration and greater permeability between our public and private sectors to optimise healthcare resources, particularly in times of emergency and crisis?Presently, the Ministry already has such a partnership with Raffles Hospital for patients with non-critical medical conditions sent there by the Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency ambulances. These patients will benefit from subsidised care at rates similar to those at our public hospitals. What is the progress on the areas of cooperation with the private sector to expand our national capacity?Primary CareNext cut. It has been demonstrated that health systems with a strong primary care sector produce better health outcomes by improving access to comprehensive care services. They also keep medical expenditures lower in the long run. Our primary care professionals are indeed the bedrock of our healthcare system here in Singapore.MOH had earlier announced that it would be building 10 to 12 new polyclinics by 2030, thereby expanding the total number to be between 30 and 32. Ten of the polyclinics' locations have been confirmed, with at least three scheduled to be opened by 2025. Are the other seven clinics on track to be ready by 2030? Would the Minister share details of the types of services each polyclinic will offer?Besides expanding our public sector primary care capacity, we should continue to strengthen our private sector as well. Our vast network of private General Practitioner (GP) clinics has the benefit of delivering the personal \"one patient, one doctor\" service. How will MOH support GPs in providing better holistic care? How close are we to the ideal of \"one patient, one doctor\" in Singapore?Under the Primary Care Networks (PCN) scheme, GP clinics can organise themselves into networks to provide team-based care. Would the Ministry provide an update on the progress of the PCN scheme? Are there any new models for primary care delivery that the Ministry is considering?The Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) system has also proven its value during this recent COVID-19 outbreak. Are there plans to expand and strengthen this very useful initiative?Polyclinic for BishanMr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Chairman, MOH announced that it would expand the number of polyclinics from the current 20 to about 30 to 32 by 2030. Three will be located in Serangoon, Kaki Bukit and Tengah and are slated to be ready by 2025. The other seven will be located in Bukit Panjang, Eunos, Kallang, Sembawang, Khatib, Tampines North and Yew Tee. Is MOH on track to reach the target of opening these seven clinics by 2030?With the locations of these 10 polyclinics confirmed, there remains two more possible sites. I strongly urge the Ministry to build one of these in Bishan.Over the last few years, a few condominiums were built in Bishan. In the next few years, HDB will be adding many blocks too. The profile of Bishan will be changed significantly with many more households and an increasing population of older residents. As of today, the proportion of senior citizens in Bishan is already higher than the national average.Presently, due to the lack of a polyclinic in Bishan, my residents have to travel to the polyclinics in Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio. As part of the journey, some of the elderly need to cross a pedestrian overhead bridge not served by elevators.A polyclinic is a facility many residents are looking forward to. It is also a necessity, so that the new households moving into Bishan will not overwhelm the polyclinics in Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio.Besides expanding public sector capacity, what are MOH's measures to support private GPs in providing better and holistic primary care for Singaporeans?Mental HealthcareDr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar): Sir, WHO once reported that depression was poised to become the second largest cause of disability worldwide after heart disease by 2020.According to the Singapore Mental Health Study conducted in 2010, 5.8% of our adult population in Singapore suffered from Major Depressive Disorder some time in life. There is a stigma attached to mental conditions that stops people acknowledging them and seeking medical help. It is important to note these afflicted persons need medical care and treatment that can relieve them from their predicaments and bring them back to normality and happiness.May I ask MOH what plans are available in detecting and treating mental illnesses and especially for depressive disorders? As good community mental health provision will enable us to have better outreach to those afflicted, may I ask how MOH is ensuring this adequacy?Raising awareness and educating more people about depression, especially on the symptoms of depression, such as suicidal thought, sleep disorder, feeling of hopelessness and loss of interest in daily activities, will prompt family members or friends to intervene earlier. Seniors especially those living alone or those with no family support are more prone to having depression. May I ask MOH whether there can be a targeted approach to reach out to these vulnerable seniors.Depression occurs in the young too. Last year, IMH said that stress-related anxiety and depressive disorders are common conditions seen at its Child Guidance Clinics which treat children aged six to 18. Our youths have long precious journeys in their lives. May I ask MOH whether there can be a holistic support for youths-at-risk to detect, to prevent and to provide early medical assistance, when necessary, to ensure their mental well-being?1.00 pmA majority of those with mental disorders do live at home. Even those with major disorders are usually not hospitalised. It is always a drain on the care-givers to look after those afflicted family members, especially those with major disorders. May I ask whether there is any scheme to better support such care-givers?Mental HealthAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member): Chairman, Sir, the 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study found that one in seven Singaporeans have experienced a mental disorder in their lifetime. Depression is the most common disorder, with around 6.3% of adults suffering from major depressive disorder at some point in their lives.The good news is that people are now more aware and more willing to seek treatment. Thus, the years of delay in seeking treatment for major depressive disorders have dropped from four in the 2010 study to one in the 2016 study.The Government's efforts to ramp up mental wellness promotion are starting to bear fruit. Indeed, the increased prevalence rates in the 2016 study could be attributed to greater awareness and willingness to seek treatment. But this also means that we are really only catching up to the true extent of mental health disorder and there are a lot more Singaporeans who remain undiagnosed.Sir, the Government and many community initiatives have been doing well in generating awareness about mental well-being. I want to focus instead on three other As – availability, accessibility and affordability.On availability, MOH announced in Budget 2017 that one in two polyclinics will have a mental wellness clinic, or a dementia clinic, or both, by 2021. There were already such clinics in seven of the 18 polyclinics in 2017. I believe the Government should aim higher now and make mental wellness clinics available to Singaporeans in all 18 polyclinics. The other issue is the availability of psychiatrists and psychologists, especially in the public health sector, as the 2016 study noted the low rate per 100,000 residents here compared to higher income countries. Are there plans to improve on this front?On accessibility, five of the seven wellness clinics in the polyclinics only see referred patients and the two Community Wellness Clinics run by IMH allow for consultation by appointments. Persons suffering from mental disorders are already finding it hard to come forward for treatment due to social stigma, thus we need to make the clinics as accessible as possible. Would the Ministry make all mental wellness clinics at polyclinic open to consultation by appointment?Lastly, on affordability, patients can withdraw from MediSave up to $500 a year for outpatient mental health treatments, but estimates for subsidised treatments ranged from $220 to $380 a month. I believe there is a need for the limit to be raised to at least $1,000 a year to make mental health treatments more affordable.Mr Chairman: Ms Anthea Ong, you can take your four cuts together.Improving Quality of Mental HealthcareMs Anthea Ong (Nominated Member): Chairman, how do we ensure that the quality of mental healthcare is on par with what Singapore is known for in healthcare? Implementing a measurement feedback system (MFS), adopted in countries such as England, could is one way.In the public consultation on mental health that my team and I conducted, 26 responses indicated feedback on treatment could improve their health outcomes. Could the Ministry clarify what measures are in place to ensure that there is regular feedback given by clients to their mental healthcare professionals?[Deputy Speaker (Mr Lim Biow Chuan) in the Chair]It is recommended by WHO and National Health Service (NHS) England that treatment for mental health conditions should be supported by talking therapies including counselling. From the consultation, 29 respondents described the importance of psychological support alongside medication in treating mental health conditions. One elaborated that her husband did not fare well on medication alone, as \"no trust was established (and) he did not open up\". Would the Ministry consider measures to ensure that individuals requiring mental healthcare be supported not only by psychiatrists and medications, but paired with psychotherapy and counselling?WHO encourages engaging stakeholders in the evaluation of mental health initiatives. In a similar vein, could the Ministry share what measures have been undertaken to involve stakeholders, including people with lived experiences of mental health conditions, in evaluating initiatives launched under the Community Mental Health Masterplan?In expanding mental healthcare into community settings, personnel including social workers and community counsellors now interact with issues of mental health, and steps should be taken to ensure they are appropriately qualified and competent. In continuity with a whole-of-Government approach, would the Ministry consider instituting a code of practice for non-medical personnel involved in mental healthcare, including psychologists, therapists and those within community settings such as social workers and community counsellors?Double Stigma of Mental Health and LGBTQ+Next cut, which was initially directed to MSF. WHO suggests that the LGBTQ+ community should be considered as a vulnerable group in mental healthcare, with the double stigma of homophobia and seeking help for mental health issues. In a recent public consultation on mental health that we conducted, 13 responses referenced such a double stigma. One lamented that \"it doesn't help too with social stigma against mental health and LGBTQ+ that push more away from the care they need, like me.\"For the LGBTQ+ community, specific issues include discrimination by mental healthcare professionals as well as disclosing one's sexual and gender identities to family without consent. Given the Government's commitment to mental healthcare in community settings, we now have social workers and counsellors who support mental health, in addition to mental healthcare professionals such as psychiatrists and psychologists. Would the Ministry consider adopting a whole-of-Government approach in ensuring that personnel working in mental healthcare, including those within community settings, are trained and competent in LGBTQ-related issues?Diversity officers supporting minorities is a common practice in the business sector. Would the Ministry consider appointing diversity officers, sited within respective agencies, across the healthcare and social services sectors? They can serve as a resource for professionals to tap on to better understand LGBTQ-related issues, help to develop competencies in serving LGBTQ individuals and ensure dissemination of LGBTQ-specific resources.Mental Healthcare Access for AllWe have come a long way in recognising mental health as an integral part of our total health, but still a long way to go in giving this priority and parity to physical health in our policies. Barriers to mental healthcare are significant issues facing many Singaporeans.First, affordability. Through the public consultation, more than 65% of the respondents felt thatcosts for mental healthcare was high, prompting some to stop treatment. One shared, \"I stopped my therapy at the hospital because I just couldn't afford it even at $17 twice a month. It caused me to be more depressed instead.\"There exists a significant disparity between claim and withdrawal limits under MediShield and Medisave for physical and mental health conditions, which is incongruent with the increasing prevalence of mental illness. I am sure the Ministry wants to assure Singaporeans that there is no discrimination against those with mental health conditions. Could the Ministry please clarify when this overdue parity in MediShield and MediSave limits for physical and mental health treatments will be rectified?Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and substance abuse are currently excluded from the list of mental health conditions covered under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) for MediSave withdrawals despite the increasing and high prevalence of these two conditions according to the Singapore Mental Health Study 2016. Will the Ministry consider including these conditions?Given the high co-morbidity between those suffering from chronic physical health conditions and those with mental health conditions, how does the Ministry ensure this group of patients benefit from sufficient Medisave withdrawal limits for outpatient treatments?In line with the spirit of the Community Mental Health Masterplan to shift mental healthcare from medical institutions into the community, would the Ministry consider allowing patients to tap on their MediSave for mental healthcare provided by community mental health services such Shan You Counselling Centre, Clarity, and Counselling and Care Centre?Lastly, to remove the firstcost hurdle and encourage help-seeking behaviour, would the Ministry consider piloting programmes that provide free initial mental health consultations with a psychiatrist or psychologist?Second, accessibility. We have 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.3 psychologists per 100,000 population. Overall, the median waiting time for new subsidised appointments is 27 and 28 days to see a psychiatrist or a psychologist respectively. Can the Ministry clarify on what plans are in store to improve these numbers so as to increase accessibility?Seventy-one respondents shared that lack of clear, trusted and consolidated information on how to seek help limited their help-seeking behaviour. There are more than 10 helplines available under NCSS' Mental Health Resource Directory. Would the Ministry consider setting up a centralised helpline – maybe 991 or something – to make it easier for a person in distress to call for help? These helplines could even be manned by peer supporters, given the many community efforts to promote peer support training.Would the Ministry also consider a centralised platform for mental health services to include information about service providers and treatment options available, estimatedcosts of treatment and available subsidies for treatment?Building on the Ministry's community outreach efforts, would the Ministry consider expanding the modes of referral for community mental healthcare, including text or web-chats, phone calls, walk-ins, referral by friends and family, and also self-referral? As subsidised referrals for public healthcare can only be made through public healthcare institutions, would the Ministry consider allowing professionals in community mental healthcare to make these subsidised referrals?PDPA and Mental Health InformationLast cut. This was initially directed to MCI. The Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices' (TAFEP) recent declaration that stating one's mental health history on job application forms is discriminatory is very welcomed, especially as 48 respondents or 12%, from this public consultation cited confidentiality issues as a prohibitive factor against seeking help.Although we have robust laws governing confidentiality in the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), there continues to be worries about access to one's mental health history within the public healthcare system, especially by employers. A respondent from the consultation shared that within the Public Service, a colleague's mental health condition was accessed through the public healthcare system and was shared as office gossip by supervisors.Additionally, respondents have shared with me their worries on the sharing of their personal information by mental healthcare professionals, including one who was threatened by her school counsellor that her parents will be informed of her same-sex relationship.There are also instances of unnecessary declarations of mental health information, with a respondent indicating that she was unable to donate blood due to her mental health history.In light of these issues, would the Ministry consider establishing a framework on rightful instances requiring mental health information declaration, accessibility of patient's mental health information within the public healthcare system and better processes for breaking of confidentiality, for example, professionals to discuss with individuals on which information continues to be kept confidential?Mental Health Rehabilitation for Persons with DisabilitiesMs Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member): Chairman, for persons with disabilities (PWDs), medical rehabilitation is always available. What is neither routinely recommended nor provided is any kind of mental health rehabilitation and support. Discrimination and abuse add their own weight to the already present guilt and shame many PWDs experience. It prevents the PWD from speaking out against it or seeking external help to cope with it. Can there be more information on where PWDs can seek access to mental healthcare if necessary?The idea persists that PWDs are disabled, not mentally challenged, and therefore do not require mental health support. This view serves only to perpetuate the stigma around mental health concerns and makes it extremely challenging for PWDs to access mental healthcare.Access to mental healthcare for deaf persons is one such example. Given that mental health support is typically given through oral consultation, whether in counseling or therapy, can the Ministry share what measures are in place to ensure that those who are hard of hearing or deaf are adequately supported by our mental healthcare professionals, both in public hospitals and community settings?Community Mental HealthMr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar): Chairman, in addition to providing better support for mental health issues at our workplaces, we also need to do our part to provide better mental health services at the community level, particularly for our youths and young adults.According to a 2018 study by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), young adults are most at risk of suffering from mental health issues in Singapore. If left unaddressed, this could significantly affect the mental well-being of the next generation of our workforce.I am therefore glad that the Government has announced that it will create the Youth Mental Well-being Network, which will bring young Singaporeans together and look at ways to promote mental wellness for their generation. I would like to ask if the Ministry has any further plans to make mental health more accessible at the community level, particularly for our youths.The Labour Movement will also do our part to foster better mental wellness among youths through our Young NTUC arm. Young NTUC has since begun engaging with youths and young working adults to better understand the mental wellness issues that affect them as they transition from school to working life.A recent study that Young NTUC conducted with over 120 youths found that close to 60% ranked mental well-being as their top workplace concern. Young NTUC is working to put together peer-to-peer support systems for our youths and I hope that the Government can partner with the Labour Movement to make mental wellness services more readily accessible to our young adults and youths.Access to Mental Health ServicesMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok): Sir, it seems to me that there are still challenges on the ground in ensuring that people suffering from mental health issues get timely access to appropriate treatment. I wish to illustrate some of these challenges through three cases I dealt with in the recent past.1.15 pmThe first challenge is difficulty in detecting these cases.Recently, I met a lady who sought some assistance to repair a water pipe in her kitchen. I arranged for a community volunteer to visit her. When he attended at her home, he observed, to his shock, that the entire hall of her home was filled with rubbish by the lady, who appears to be suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). No one, even her immediate neighbour, knew of hoarding. Not only that, the lady was staying with her daughter who was later identified as suffering from depression. She used to receive from IMH but defaulted.Quite clearly, the lady and her daughter are unable to seek help on their own. If not for the chance meeting between the mother and I, this case would not have been detected.The second challenge we see on the ground is lack of cooperation on the part of care-givers, mostly because of lack of trust.A few months back, I received a complaint from a resident of noise disturbance from his neighbour. I asked my community volunteer to help mediate.The family residing at the unit in question consists of three persons: father, mother and their young son. My volunteer could immediately tell that the son was mentally unwell. He was not able to look at my volunteer in the eye. He was muttering to himself and pacing to and fro. The parents related that he has a habit of shouting and banging on the walls, too.My volunteer tried to convince the boy’s parents to admit him to IMH. The father was, unfortunately, dead set against sending his son to IMH because of some unrelated incident that happened in the past.In the meantime, the poor neighbours continue to put up with the disturbance which happens in the wee hours of the night.Without the parents’ consent, there was no way even for the IMH Crisis Team to attend at the scene to intervene to help the boy. In addition, because the boy's actions were not deemed to be a danger to himself or others, he cannot be arrested under the Mental Capacities Act and brought to IMH, too.The third challenge is ignorance on the part of care-givers.I recently met a couple at their home. Their daughter, now in her 20s, has been holed up in her bedroom for years. She simply refused to come out from her room since she was in Secondary 3. When I asked them why they decided not to ask for help earlier, they told me that they were worried that her daughter may end her life. Hence, they kept quiet.They were plainly anguished by their daughter's condition but simply did not know what to do for years. Not only that, they were undergoing serious stress themselves and would have suffered mental meltdown, if not for subsequent intervention.Sir, as can be seen from these cases, mental health cases are sometimes presented as social issues that have arisen in the community. Hence, it may be useful to consider engaging the representatives of organisations involved such as the grassroots organisation, Police, SSO, FSCs and so on in an integrated way so that a plan may be drawn up for each patient who has been identified as needing help.In particular, we should keep an eye and follow up on patients who are suffering from serious mental illnesses who have defaulted in their treatment. This is because treatment for such cases is focused on containing the situation, not to cure the patients. So, if they are not receiving treatment, one can reasonably expect these patients to be in trouble.Alternative Medicine PractitionerMr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap: Sir, the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is widespread in Singapore, with a study showing that as high as 76% of Singaporeans are utilising at least one form of CAM. This is not only includes traditional medicine practices, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jammu and Ayurvedic medicine, but also includes practices such as Chiropractic and Homoeopathy. However, not all types of CAMs are treated the same under our existing laws and regulations.Currently, only Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners are regulated under separate legislation and Chinese proprietary medicines are regulated by HSA. However, regulations do not cover the Jammu or Ayurvedic practitioners or the product they sell.Chiropractic practices popular amongst office worker has also seen an increasing number of complaints against practitioners in the field as reported by The Straits Times in 2016. This has led to a call by the Chiropractic Association for Government regulation. The lack of regulation, particularly concerning the unregulated use of CAM practices, may lead to detrimental outcomes of patients who simultaneously see western-trained doctors alongside CAM practitioners.A 2017 Straits Times article reported that CAM is widely used by patients doing chemotherapy which sometimes increases the side effects of chemotherapy. The same article also reported that the use of CAM also delayed a patient seeking western treatment by an extra six weeks as compared to non-CAM users, exacerbating their conditions.With the pitfalls that patients could suffer from CAM being left unregulated, I propose that MOH considers studying the possibility of a regime that can regulate CAM practitioners in the same way TCM practitioners are being regulated now, which can fall under the ambit of a potential Complementary and Alternative Medicine Act. The Act can help to set regulations that imposes a minimum standard of protection against consumers.Such a regime should consider requiring mandatory registration for all CAM practitioners and mandatory information given to the patient about the underlying risks of using CAM. This also should include the mandatory disclosure of usage of CAM treatment to healthcare medical practitioners when patients seek medical treatment. Such a regime should ensure regulation is in place for both CAM practitioners and patient that otherwise need to seek recourse elsewhere.The Chairman: Minister Gan.The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong): Mr Chairman, several Members of Parliament have asked about COVID-19. Let me provide an update on the situation.As of 4 March 2020, yesterday, we have 112 confirmed cases, 79 have been discharged while 33 patients remain in hospital. Of these seven are in critical condition. Contact tracing is on-going. Dr Chia asked about contact tracing, we are indeed strengthening our capability on contact tracing efforts. I want to thank Singaporeans for their cooperation and support for the various measures we have implemented, without which, our efforts will not be effective.Globally, the number of cases outside mainland China continues to grow at an alarming rate across continents and regions. This is worrying as they pose a high risk of importation of cases into Singapore. Therefore, we must expect to see significantly higher numbers of new cases in time to come.In line with our risk assessment of the situation, we have implemented precautionary measures, including travel advisories and restrictions, temperature screening, contact tracing, quarantine, among others.Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the effectiveness of our current strategy and how we can better prepare for the future. We have to appreciate that every outbreak is different. COVID-19 is different from SARS and different from H1N1. Even as we do our best to learn from each outbreak and prepare for the next, we must always expect the unexpected.To mount a swift and effective response, we have to adopt a whole-of-Government approach and mobilise the resources of all the relevant agencies. This will allow us to assess, decide and execute our response quickly.It is important to be transparent, too and share the information we know as soon as possible. This will help to preserve the trust between the people and the Government so that we can have the support of the public as we work together to fight COVID-19. It is also crucial to counter and respond decisively to fake news to avoid diversion of our resources and prevent disruption to our efforts.The international scientific community has been working hard to study the virus, share new findings and develop solutions. We are sharing our best practices, research and knowledge on COVID-19 with other countries. For example, scientists from China published the genetic sequence of the COVID-19 virus quite early on, on 12 January 2020. Within just over a week, Singapore’s National Public Health Laboratory (NHPL) developed a specific PCR diagnostic test. Shortly after, A*STAR produced a PCR test kit, which has been used locally and shared with international partners to help identify patients and contain the disease. Our scientists are also participating in international clinical trials for treatment and vaccines.Ms Sylvia Lim asked about using blood plasma for treatment. We are indeed planning to do so and NCID is collecting blood plasma from patients but there are limitations and constraints.It may take some time before effective treatments and vaccines become available. As the global situation evolves, many countries may become infected. It will become increasingly difficult to stop the virus at our borders as we cannot ban visitors from every country and shut ourselves out from the world.Even amongst our closest neighbours, the situation is also evolving. Therefore, it is likely that we will continue to see more cases and this disease will stay with us for quite a long time. We will have to continuously adjust, fine-tune our measures to deal with the disease so that life can go on while appropriate precautions are put in place.I am glad to see the SG Clean campaign picking up momentum and I would like to thank Minister Masagos for leading this important effort. More initiatives will be announced later. All of us have a role to play and we must continue the good practices that have proven effective in reducing the spread of infectious diseases – such as staying home when unwell, practising good personal hygiene. I am beginning to sound like a broken record, but sometimes broken records are good.We should also maintain high public hygiene standards in our food centres and public toilets. This will strengthen our collective resilience against COVID-19 as well as other infectious diseases, while allowing us to go about our daily lives as normally as possible.Our healthcare workers are critical in our efforts in managing and containing this outbreak. I want to assure Dr Chia Shi-Lu that they are well-trained on infection control and prevention, and are provided with the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for their safety. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their contributions and their dedication.As Deputy Prime Minister announced, we will be giving them a token of appreciation through a Special Bonus for healthcare workers in our public hospitals and institutions, who are directly involved with treating COVID-19 patients. The senior management of our three healthcare clusters have informed me that as a gesture of solidarity with our healthcare workers, they will donate their own Special Bonuses to the staff welfare fund of their respective clusters.The details of the Special Bonus for our healthcare workers will be released in due course, but for now our focus is to keep up our fight to contain the spread of COVID-19.Mr Chairman, even as we tackle the COVID-19 outbreak, we need to continue to plan forward and build our healthcare system. MOH first introduced Healthcare 2020 in 2012 to increase accessibility, raise quality and enhance the affordability of healthcare services.We are now in 2020, Dr Chia Shi-Lu, Mr Christopher de Souza and Ms Tin Pei Ling have all asked how we have fared with regard to Healthcare 2020. Mr Chairman, I must say I did not expect to still be Minister for Health in 2020. But I am still Minister for Health and I am happy to share that MOH has delivered on what we promised. [Applause.]We have invested significantly in infrastructure to add capacity. In 2019 alone, we opened the National University Centre for Oral Health Singapore and Outram Community Hospital. The Sengkang General and Community Hospitals, which first began seeing patients in 2018, were also officially opened in 2019. Of course, we also opened the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) in time for this COVID-19 outbreak.We stepped up building of long-term care facilities too like nursing homes and daycare centres to meet the needs of our ageing population.We continued to improve the quality of care, with significant expansion in medical school and nursing intakes to ensure sufficient healthcare manpower. We expanded our polyclinic and GP networks, and further integrated patient care through the introduction of team-based care, and strengthened referral pathways to our Specialists Outpatient Clinics (SOCs).We have made healthcare more affordable for all. Over the years, we have progressively enhanced and expanded the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) to make primary care more affordable and for all Singaporeans. We also introduced the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation Packages in 2014 and 2019 to help our senior generations. Since then, almost one million Pioneers and Merdeka Generation seniors have received over $2.5 billion in benefits.We rolled out the MediShield Life and will be launching CareShield Life (CSHL) later this year together with other changes to make MediSave usage more flexible which many Members of Parliament have asked about. Senior Minister of State Tong will go into greater details later on.Most importantly, our overall healthcare outcomes have improved, with longer life expectancy and Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE). This means that Singaporeans are not only living longer but living longer in good health.1.30 pmHowever, this is the bad news. There is still room for improvement. Singaporeans are still living about 10 years in ill health. Several factors have contributed to this. Based on National Population Health Survey 2017, for example, approximately one in three of residents aged 40-69 has hypertension, one in seven has diabetes and two in five have hyperlipidaemia. To combat chronic diseases, we declared War on Diabetes in 2016. Let me give an update on the War on Diabetes that Mr Chen Show Mao has asked for.To overcome this fearsome adversary, we have to start at the ground level, to build a strong foundation by shaping an eco-system that encourages healthier choices like living healthy lives and staying physically active. While healthier lives for Singaporeans will take many years of effort to realise, some of our efforts have yielded early progress.For example, we have created more options for healthier meals. As of 2019, one in two stalls across hawker centres and coffeeshops listed at least one healthier option on their menu, as part of the Healthier Dining Programme (HDP). The number of healthier meals sold also grew to 205 million in 2019, up from 158 million in 2018. The prevalence of regular leisure-time exercise has also increased by about six percentage points from 29% to 35% between 2017 and 2019.We will be launching a public campaign later this year to increase awareness on regular diabetic foot and eye screening. With greater awareness, we hope to reduce the incidence of lower limb amputation and give our patients better quality of life. These are just some of the many efforts we are taking on preventive healthcare that Ms Tin Pei Ling has asked about. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Amrin will be sharing more on our efforts later.Besides prevention, we are also providing greater support for individuals living with diabetes. Under our Patient Empowerment for Self-care Framework, we have developed the National Diabetes Reference Materials on HealthHub, as a comprehensive resource for patients and their care-givers. This is helpful for patients and families as they can \"self-help\" themselves to information about their condition and what they can do for better disease management. For example, patients who wish to start exercising can learn simple, safe and practical ways to do so. These materials can also be customised by healthcare professionals for their own patients.Our healthcare clusters will also be commencing pilot programmes from the second half of 2020 to increase patients' ownership of their care journeys. For example, one of the programmes will empower newly diagnosed patients with diabetes to initiate and sustain lifestyle changes through group health coaching and greater peer support.To win the war on diabetes we will need concerted, multi-year efforts and many of these efforts will only bear fruit in the long-term. However, we will continue to monitor the intermediate outcomes, like physical activity and dietary practices to better track the progress of our various initiatives.Going forward, I would like to assure Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Mr Christopher de Souza that we will continue to invest in new healthcare infrastructure and facilities to ensure care continues to be accessible to meet the needs of the ageing population.We will be opening four more new polyclinics in over the next two years. Senior Minister of State Lam will share more about the expansion plans for our polyclinics later on. Woodlands Health Campus is scheduled to open progressively from 2022. We had experienced some challenges during the construction due to soil conditions, but we have mostly caught up. Now, with COVID-19, we are discussing with our contractors and suppliers to assess the impact and we hope to minimise delays.Other upcoming facilities include a new community hospital in Novena and the redevelopment of two national specialist centres, that is, the new National Cancer Centre and the National Skin Centre.MOH had previously announced that National University Health Systems (NUHS) would design new and innovative care models and test them at the Alexandra Hospital (AH) as part of AH's future development. The master planning exercise of AH was completed in 2019 and we will be calling tender soon for Medical Planners for this project. The first phase of redevelopment is scheduled to be completed by 2030.Ms Tin Pei Ling has asked about healthcare capacity in the east. Changi General Hospital (CGH) is currently the only hospital in the east. While we have added significant capacity in CGH through expansion over the years, the healthcare demand has grown substantially as a result of population growth and ageing. Ms Tin will be pleased to know that we have commenced the planning of a new integrated acute and community hospital in the east, targeted to be ready around 2030. While the hospital will include the normal range of hospital services, we also want to hear what the community would like to see in this new hospital. As such, SingHealth, which will be operating this new hospital, will be engaging the community to co-create ideas to better meet the needs of the residents there. SingHealth will reach out to the community leaders when they are ready to do so.Expanding our healthcare system will also mean that expenditure on healthcare will grow, both in the developmentcost of building new facilities, and later on, as thecost of operating these facilities.Overall, our national health expenditure increased from $13 billion in 2012 to $22 billion in 2017, or about 11% per annum.Of this 11%, about five percentage points of this 11% increase was due to increased utilisation. Let me explain.As our population ages and grows, demand for healthcare services also increases, as some Members of Parliament observed earlier.We are also utilising more healthcare than in the past, even after accounting for ageing and population growth. This is partly the result of making care more accessible and affordable to all, and partly due to earlier diagnosis, closer monitoring and follow-ups for medical conditions, that means, more frequent consultations and treatment. The range of treatment options has also expanded as the frontiers of medicine advance, increasing utilisation, but at the same time, improving lifespans and the quality of life.That is five percentage points of the 11%.\tApproximately, another four percentage points of the growth in national health expenditure can be attributed to higher manpowercosts. On the one hand, our healthcare workforce expanded significantly between 2012 and 2017. On the other hand, our healthcare workers' salaries also increased as we implemented pay adjustments to attract and retain our healthcare workers. So, that is four and five, that, is nine percentage points out of 11%. The remaining two percentage points have largely been due to increases in thecosts of drugs, medical devices and other overheads.And as Deputy Prime Minister highlighted in his Budget 2020 round-up speech, we can expect that the overall national health expenditure will continue to increase as our population ages and we step up our investments in facilities and services. But we must continue to be prudent in our healthcare expenditure to ensure that it is directed towards where it gives us the best outcomes.Therefore, to answer Dr Chia and Ms Tin Pei Ling's questions on what our strategy is going forward, we must continue on our transformation journey for healthcare to ensure we have a good and sustainable system. We must press on with our efforts to go beyond healthcare to health, beyond hospital to community and beyond quality to value.Patients too can play a role. We can make wise decisions and choices and have a trusted family physician to turn to for advice. Only then can we ensure that our healthcare system is sustainable and remains affordable for our patients.Information technology (IT) will continue to be an essential enabler for our healthcare system, and we will continue to strengthen our governance and safeguards on our data. This will be essential to maintain the public's trust.Over the past year, we have been taking concrete steps to implement the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry (COI) on the SingHealth cyber attack. These steps will help to raise the cybersecurity posture of the public healthcare system. Close to 80% of the control measures recommended have been implemented or mitigated. The more complex measures require careful implementation to avoid disrupting essential healthcare services and impacting patient safety. These will be progressively completed by 2022.Various enhancements have also been made to strengthen the security of the National Electronic Health Records (NEHR). Work is still on-going and the enhancements are being implemented. Mandatory contribution to NEHR will be deferred until all enhancements are completed and we are satisfied that the system is assessed to be sufficiently robust. We will further updates at the appropriate juncture.[Mr Speaker in the Chair]While we secure our systems, we continue to explore new technologies, such as telemedicine, how they can improve care. To-date, 25 public healthcare institutions and 39 community care partners have started video consultation pilot services. We will also leverage technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and robotics to support the work in public healthcare, which Dr Chia has asked about in his cut.One example we are already deploying is the Singapore Eye Lesion Analyser Plus (SELENA+). This is a deep-learning artificial intelligence software system which can detect three major eye conditions: diabetic eye disease, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. SELENA+ highlights areas with potential vision threatening eye disease and refers abnormal cases to human graders, allowing them to focus on the more complex cases. SELENA+ has proven to be more efficient in delivering fast and accurate results. Building on SELENA+'s capabilities, a predictive risk assessment model for cardiovascular disease will be developed to help doctors accurately identify high-risk patients and conduct more timely interventions to save lives and achieve better outcomes.To conclude, shaping better healthcare in Singapore is not something that MOH and our healthcare providers can do alone. Everyone will have a role to play in this.We can start by taking care of our own health – by taking responsibility to keep ourselves healthy, we can live better, longer and healthier lives. Mr Chairman, if I may, let me speak in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]To battle COVID-19, we must be calm and not panic. As long as we take the right precautions, pay attention to personal hygiene, we can carry on with our day-to-day activities. I would like to take this opportunity to urge Singaporeans to exercise more and stay healthy. I am happy to see that many of our exercise programmes have resumed, after putting in place the appropriate safety measures.Last Sunday, together with Minister Masagos and a few colleagues, I went to the Teck Whye Garden in Choa Chu Kang to take part in their community morning exercise that was just resumed. I am heartened to see that so many of our residents are committed to staying healthy and actively participate in activities.(In English): Sir, keeping everyone healthy is a team effort and we are all part of that team. So, let us all play our part to keep Singapore and Singaporeans in good health. [Applause.]The Chairman: Mr Melvin Yong.Healthcare ManpowerMr Melvin Yong Yik Chye: Chairman, our healthcare workers have been working tirelessly since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak to combat the spread of the virus. Many have suspended vacations and put in extra hours. I commend all healthcare workers – nurses, doctors, medics, and more – for putting your lives on the line to serve Singapore.Indeed, healthcare workers are a special group of professionals and I urge our tripartite partners to come together to do more for them.One, let us recognise them not only when we have a crisis. Two, let us ramp up recruitment efforts and bring in more local talents. And three, let us reduce attrition and address the reasons why some leave service.Sir, with our ageing population, our healthcare system will require more workers, especially nurses. While I commend the Ministry's \"Care To Go Beyond\" campaign, which profiles the work of nurses to attract locals into the industry, more needs to be done. I would like to ask what are MOH's plans to meet the increasing demand for healthcare workers, particularly in community care.1.45 pmPerhaps the Ministry can consider recruiting more mid-career nurses in their 50s and place them in wards that are less intense. Mdm Wan Sok Meng, a staff nurse at the National University Hospital, is one such example. At 59 years old, Mdm Wan finally achieved her childhood ambition of becoming a nurse. More details of her story and other inspiring stories of those who have found nursing to be their calling in life can be found on my blog post today – because I only have limited time here!Sir, in addition to recruitment, we also need to retain more healthcare workers and encourage more to return to nursing. About 850 local nurses leave our public healthcare sector yearly for a variety of reasons. Despite best efforts to attract them to return to nursing, only around 400 return to practice annually.Some do not return because they feel that their skills are out of touch. To address this, our Healthcare Services Employees' Union (HSEU) is in partnership talks with Homage, a technology platform that matches trained and qualified care professionals to those in need of care, to explore providing nurses and care-givers who resign with opportunities to freelance as a care professional and keep their skills relevant. The union is also discussing how to provide training to these nurses through its Healthcare Academy – training that are relevant and timely.I hope that the Ministry can work with the Labour Movement to improve retention of nurses and to encourage those who have left service to return to nursing.Healthcare WorkersAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong: Chairman, Sir, even as we honour our frontline healthcare workers in this COVID-19 situation, we should make sure that we protect them in three ways: physical health and safety, mental wellness and social well-being.On physical health and safety, the most heartbreaking COVID-19 news are those on doctors and nurses getting infected and succumbing to the disease. The SARS outbreak saw about one-fifth of the cases occurring among healthcare workers. A recent article by Dr Gan Wee Hoe and Dr Chia Kee Seng published in The Straits Times gave details on some measures taken to protect the health and safety of our healthcare workers. Would the Minister share the key measures implemented to protect our healthcare workers' own health and safety?On mental wellness, again, based on the SARS experience, frontline healthcare workers suffer from high levels of burn-out and post-traumatic stress. Would the Minister please share whether any mental health resources are made available to our healthcare workers in this crisis, and whether free counselling and mental health resources can be made available to our frontline healthcare workers for the years after this crisis has blown over?On social well-being, reports of healthcare workers in uniform being ostracised in public bring back ugly memories from the SARS epidemic, where about half of local healthcare workers experienced some form of social stigmatisation. I think it is amazing to see how many Singaporeans are fighting back to show appreciation to our frontline workers in concrete ways.Nevertheless, I want to raise two points here. First, are healthcare workers afforded any legal protection from being abused when they are in uniform, whether at work or in public? Second, in a recent Straits Times report on the ostracisation of nurses in uniform, healthcare leaders reassured the public that the uniforms do not pose any risk of infection.After this crisis has blown over, it may be timely to rethink whether uniforms are important for nurses or they should, like doctors, go to work in office attire and change to professional scrubs at work.I am ambivalent about this as I grew up watching my mum go to work in her nurse uniform and I am still immensely proud of her. She related to me some of the obstracisation she experienced during SARS and how it forced her to change out of uniform to return home. Thus, I would rather see a change in public attitude. Nevertheless, a public conversation on the uniform will be useful, if anything, to see whether the public attitude can be changed.Community NursingMs Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar): It has been three years since Community Nursing (CN) teams were set up as part of the Ministry's nationwide plan to bring healthcare closer to communities and homes, especially for the more vulnerable elderly residents. These personalised, coordinated and fully-subsidised care services play a crucial role in preventive care for the less privileged seniors.As the nurses visit their patients in their homes, they are better able to detect the environment, social and other factors affecting their health. This enables them to have a more holistic understanding of their patients' needs. Over time, patients build trust in their nurses and this makes it easier for them to open up and accept their nurses' advice.With our rapidly ageing population, more Community Nursing Posts (CNPs) will be required in our neighbourhoods all over Singapore. Would the Minister share an update on the number of such Community Nursing Posts to date and how many more does it intend to set up in the next 10 years? The posts are currently located at Senior Activity Centres. Will MOH partner with other organisations such as other Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) to expand the location options for future posts, as this will bring care closer to home for seniors.How many nurses are working under this scheme and how many more will MOH recruit to cope with the increasing number of elderly persons in the coming years? What is the ratio of community nurses to residents under their charge? How has the retention rate of the nurses been so far?Allied Healthcare–Career and SupportMr Christopher de Souza: Allied healthcare workers such as physiotherapists, speech therapists, nurses, medical support staff all play a significant role in the overall care for the patient. Methods to increase opportunities and training for their career and wage advancements are also key. This will ensure that a strong, core body of well-trained allied healthcare workers can pass down their experiences and knowledge to successive cohorts. How has the MOH prioritised their career and wage advancement and training?The Chairman: Ms Irene Quay, you can take your two cuts together.Medical Certificates by Allied Health ProfessionalsMs Irene Quay Siew Ching (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, I declare my interest as the President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore and the Assistant Director of Allied Health Office at KK Women's and Children's Hospital.I would like to speak on how MOH can empower our allied health practitioners, AHPs in short, and collaborative prescribing practitioners, or CPPs in short, to combat chronic diseases in Singapore by giving them the right tools through specific policy changes.I spoke during the Employment (Amendment) Bill debate in 2018 on allowing AHPs and CPPs to issue recognised medical certificates (MCs). Currently under the Medical Registration Act, only qualified medical practitioners are able to issue medical certificates.As our ageing population increases along with the surge in chronic diseases, we need to change our approach towards long-term follow-up for chronic patients to ensure healthcare and financial sustainability. AHPs and CPPs need to have the right tools to step up in their roles to care for these patients. At the moment, it is reassuring to see more of them taking over follow-up appointments for chronic cases as well as being equipped to manage them.However, they are handicapped for reasons pertaining to regulatory restrictions. Patients often require MCs after consultation and they will have to be directed to medical doctors for issuances of MCs. This results in unnecessary delays to patients and is disruptive to the AHPs and CPPs as well as the doctor who might be seeing another patient.I request that MOH consider permitting this group of healthcare professionals to issue MCs which are limited to two days per patient visit, starting with restructured healthcare institutions where AHPs and CPPs are taking on more in the management of chronic disease patients. This can be piloted through a regulatory sandbox approach. Perhaps, Public services can also take the lead to recognise time sheets and reimbursement for minor ailments and medication from retail pharmacies to relieve our polyclinics from their heavy workload.In a similar vein, I understand that MOH has been attempting to right-site chronic disease patients to be cared for in the community by AHPs. Can the Minister provide an update on the success of this shift so far and the projected targets for the next five years?I am concerned that the current financial gradient may not be steep enough to facilitate this shift from acute to the community. May I ask if MOH is looking at porting more subsidies for AHPs in the community settings to facilitate this transition? If done right, I see potential to effect an even more efficient and financially sustainable healthcare system for our citizens.Combat Medication AdherenceMr Chairman, in thisCOSspeech, I would like to address the need to direct support towards pharmacists in tackling medication-related issues within the community.One such issue is polypharmacy, which is the concurrent use of multiple medication. It is a growing and persistent issue in Singapore as our population rapidly ages alongside with an increase in the number of patients with chronic diseases.In the previous committee hearing, I talked about the different types of medication waste. Some examples include expired drugs, drug hoarding, drugs prescribed without indication, or duplication of drug therapy. I quoted a study from a local hospital on the estimated drug wastagecost detected during hospital pharmacist visits, at any time point, to be a staggering figure of $663 per patient.For this year's committee hearing, I would like to highlight another grave medication-related problem in our healthcare system – medication non-adherence or compliance. This issue is especially prevalent among the elderly.In late 2017, researchers from the National Healthcare Group Health Services and Outcomes Research department reported that seven in 20 newly diagnosed diabetic patients do not adhere to prescribed medication. This makes up about 35% of newly diagnosed diabetes patients in Singapore. There are many reasons for medication non-adherence, which include a lack of understanding or knowledge of diabetic medicine, difficulty in managing their complex medication regimen, concerns about medication side-effects and cultural beliefs.Another study by the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health and the Department of Pharmacy in NUS shows that pharmacists play an important role in educating patients on how their medication work. This can help to prevent long-term complications by explaining to patients the potential side-effects and how to manage them.However, to address the many concerns that patients may have is very time-consuming. Currently, pharmacists working in healthcare institutions are beset by high patient load on a daily basis. They are unable to tailor individualised care for the needs of each patient and to follow-up to ensure that their concerns are addressed.For instance, according to the Well-being of the Singapore Elderly (WiSE) study led by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) in 2015, one in 10 persons aged 60 and above may have dementia. This translates to almost 82,000 people in 2018, and the number is expected to exceed 100,000 in a few years' time. These patients requiring multiple medications will most certainly be at high risk of polypharmacy and non-compliance.I would therefore like to propose to MOH to set aside and expedite funding to support pharmaceutical services, particularly in the areas of medication review and reconciliation, de-prescribing efforts and related health literacy education, medication delivery services to facilitate instalment collections to avoid medication hoarding and waste, subsidies for adherence toolkits such as pill boxes and medication packaging instructions to fill these pillboxes, and multi-dose drug sachet dispensaries to improve drug compliance.A recent report from the MOH Health Manpower Development Plan (HMDP) visiting expert, Dr Catriona Bradley, pointed out that the resources of the current community pharmacists are not optimised, and that there is an uneven spread of work leveraging on the capabilities that exist within primary care. She recommends increasing the deployment of community pharmacists in the areas of medication management and pharmaceutical care, which is in line with directives from the World Health Organization's (WHO) Patient Safety Challenge of \"Medication Without Harm\".I quote verbatim, \"Where multiple prescribers treat the same patients across primary and secondary care, there is a need for a central point of review for medications\".I understand that MOH is currently piloting studies to explore the benefits andcost effectiveness of such pharmaceutical services, but in view of the ageing tsunami, expedited efforts are necessary to galvanise our healthcare professionals to oversee this urgently.Regardless of how much funding our Government pours in to subsidise drug treatments and improve access to medication, a patient's treatment cannot be optimised if he or she does not swallow a pill that is tailored to their needs.Mr Chairman, I would like the Committee to consider my proposal to increase funding towards pharmacists with regard to the above-mentioned points. This will enable them to provide more individualised care for patients and at the same time, reduce medication-related problems and long-term healthcarecost in the community.EldercareDr Lily Neo: Sir, may I ask MOH what further plans are in place to enhance the care of our seniors? Many seniors express the desire to age in place for as long as possible. What are the measures provided to facilitate them to achieve this aim? It is a known fact that keeping seniors socially, physically and mentally active early on when they are mobile will assist them to have healthier and happier lives as they age. This will enable them to lead independent lives, ageing in place in their own homes and in the community for as long as possible.Will MOH implement a baseline service model for all our eldercare centres to have programmes that will help achieve the above targets?2.00 pmPreventive healthcare, such as preventing premature mobility difficulty or disability, will enable our seniors to live independent lives for as long as possible. Thus, the aim is to limit and delay the onset of disabilities in old age which more often than not are due to diseases. The most common causes of disability among older adults are chronic diseases, injuries, mental impairment and visual impairment. Early detection and having good control on chronic diseases can prevent disabilities such as strokes and heart diseases. Physical activities and keeping active can make our seniors stronger and lower their chances of falling, reduce their fracture rates and prevent injuries. Regular eye checks to diagnose cataracts and other visual impairments for early treatment can also prevent disability in seniors.Our eldercare centres can support our seniors in this area by paying attention to their health, by checking their hypertension, monitoring their diabetes, arranging yearly eyes check and when necessary, referring them for medical help.As seniors live till ripe old age, frailty may inevitably set in. But even so, with the right measures of social and medical assistance in place to assist them with their daily living, they can still age gracefully in the comfort of their own homes.The Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) of MOH has in place such a program that presently looks after about 500 frail seniors living alone at HDB rental flats in the Chin Swee and Kreta Ayer precincts. It is an excellent scheme that should be extended to other constituencies. AIC has a team of two nurses and eight healthcare aides, who attend to the seniors; supervising their medical conditions and daily living essentials. This team also arranges for the grassroots volunteers and various voluntary care groups on assisting the social needs of these seniors in a coordinated effort. This has enabled residents to have lesser frequency of hospital visits and has enabled them to stay in their own homes despite their illnesses and immobility.Supporting Seniors Age in Place and GraceMs Tin Pei Ling: In Singapore, we see a rapid rise in elderly population and smaller families. On the ground, it is not uncommon to meet elderly parents who shared that they wish not to burden their children or who are struggling to get by because their children simply have too many life priorities but they are sadly not one of them. This shift in demographics, family structure and individual attitudes has a profound impact on our society and how we organise ourselves in time to come.At present, we see a network of community partners offering a range of services to our seniors. There are also efforts to better coordinate efforts across the different partners. Could the MOH share how effective has this approach been in engaging and serving the needs of our seniors? We have about 3,000 Silver Ambassadors now, how successful are we in reaching out to the different corners of our community? It is important that we reach the frail and lonely, every senior counts. How else can we better engage our seniors to avoid social isolation and better support them to age in place and with grace?How can we leverage technology to coordinate our community networks and resources better and to engage our seniors better?With so much done and will be done, I wonder when and how will we know if we have succeeded in achieving our vision of ageing in place and with grace. Could MOH articulate how Singapore has progressed in terms of caring for our seniors over the past decade? What is the state of physical and mental health of our seniors in Singapore and how has this changed over the years? Are there indicators that MOH uses to monitor our seniors' social well-being and how engaged they are in Singapore?Long-term CareAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong: Chairman, Sir, the Government has been preparing for the ageing society that is already upon us. Intermediate and long-term care, or ILTC as it is known, will become a critical sector in our healthcare system. This year Singaporeans will see the introduction of CareShield Life and MediSave withdrawals for long-term care.A severely disabled Singaporean, who is unable to perform three or more activities of daily living, will receive a payout of $600 for life, and if the Singaporean's Medisave balance is $20,000 and above, he or she can withdraw another $200 a month. If we add in the Home Caregiving Grant, there is another $200 in cash assistance to receive. This adds up to a potential $1,000 in cash withdrawals to support the financing of the long-term care needs of a severely disabled Singaporean. If the affected person is from the Pioneer Generation, there is another $100 in cash assistance.Sir, my concern is with the financing needs of middle-income households, especially those whose wage earners are from the sandwich generation facing thecost of raising school-going children and supporting ageing parents. The latest figure for 2019 from the Department of Statistics for median monthly household income from work per household member is $2,925. This suggests that about half of Singaporean households will not get any subsidies for their elderly household member accessing ILTC non-residential services, since cut off for subsidies is $2,800.A Long-term Care study by Aviva in 2018 suggests that one would need around $2,300 a month on average for care, medical and everyday expenses. Sandwiched middle income wage earners could be facing the additional financing burden of around $1,300 a month to support an elderly parent needing long-term care.I believe this burden will become widely felt in the near future, if it is not already being felt. Already, for the Home Caregiving Grant, there is a note on the AIC website that says it will take about three months to process applications due to the high volume of applications received. Has the Ministry done any study to ascertain the long-term care financing needs of middle-income households in the next five to 10 years? What more can be done to support the long-term care financing needs of middle-income households who fall outside of the Government subsidy threshold? Would opening CareShield Life to additional private insurance enhancements regulated by MOH like the Integrated Shield Plans of MediShield Life, with premiums payable by MediSave within limits be a possible answer?Foreign Domestic Workers and EldercareMs Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member): Chairman, Sir, in the last few years, the number of households with at least one member aged 65 years and above who hired a foreign domestic worker has been increasing. It seems that more families are relying on the help of a domestic worker to care for their elderly family member. Does the Ministry expect a growth in this number over the next few years?Overall, does the Ministry view foreign domestic workers as a long-term measure in supporting our aging population? What is the Government's overall strategy to the role of foreign domestic workers in providing eldercare? Will this extend to the government's management of foreign domestic worker employment agencies?Emerging data from AWARE's research on foreign domestic workers' role in eldercare suggest that domestic workers experience the lack of training in providing eldercare as a source of work stress. Would the Ministry consider mandating training for domestic workers who are hired to care for older persons or persons who need assistance with a certain number of Activities of Daily Living?Respite for Care-giversMr Christopher de Souza: A lot of strain and pressure is felt by care-givers,especially those who are caring for an elder in the family while working. These responsibilities sometimes fall on a sibling who is single and staying with a parent or both parents. They need to work at the workplace, come home to care for their elderly and make significant decisions for the person they care for. As such, what measures have we put in place to provide respite care and how effective have these measures been?Assisted LivingMs Joan Pereira: Sir, the Ministry announced last year that it was working with MND and HDB to pilot an assisted living development in public housing for the elderly. Seniors would be able to select a HDB flat with senior-friendly features and choose from a menu of care packages with optional add-on services to suit their needs and preferences. Examples of these choices include health screening, exercise classes, personal care, housekeeping and round-the clock emergency support. The development would even come with communal facilities and programmes to encourage social interaction.It is an exciting development and I am glad to note that Singapore's first Assisted Living Public Housing for seniors will be launched in Bukit Batok in May. I strongly believe that this will help our seniors age in place. May I ask the following: how has the progress been thus far? Which service providers have been shortlisted as partners? How much will such a unit and the care packagescost? Will there be enough assisted living flats for all seniors especially with our ageing population. What other initiatives is the Ministry considering to support active ageing and to help our seniors age in place?The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor.The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan): Chairman, ageing should not be regarded as a Silver Tsunami to be feared but rather as Silver Equity to be drawn upon. Longevity is also not a disease! It is a gift to celebrate, so long as we stay healthy. With the gift of time and health, we can pursue the things we enjoy.Minister Gan shared that Singaporeans have a life expectancy of 84.8 years, of which 74.2 years are lived in full health. How would we seize the opportunities of at least 74 good years?Since we launched the Action Plan for Successful Ageing in 2015, we have made significant strides in building a caring and inclusive home, centred on 3Cs – care, contribution, and connectedness. From scaling up the Community Networks of Seniors nationwide, to promoting learning and volunteering opportunities, we have sought to enable seniors to age in a caring environment, pursue the activities they enjoy and contribute to others in the way they wish.We are also helping our seniors stay connected by capitalising on man's best friend. No, I do not mean a dog or cat – Member Mr Louis Ng is not here – but, you might have guessed it. I mean the smart phone.Together with Smart Nation and Digital Government Office and Public Service Division, we have developed the Active Ageing module in the Moments of Life (MOL) app. As one of the 250,000 Merdeka Generation members that the Silver Generation Ambassadors have reached out to to-date, I found it really easy to access information about the various active ageing programmes via the MOL app and pick the one nearest home.From next month, not only can I browse information on the MOL app, I can also sign up and \"chope\" a spot for active ageing programmes by the Health Promotion Board (HPB), such as health talks, cooking demonstrations and more!This January, we launched the Healthy Longevity Catalyst Awards in partnership with the United States National Academy of Medicine, to spur bold, innovative ideas and technology to extend healthy longevity. This could include assistive devices, smart-enabled homes or job redesign solutions. We received more than 100 applications and I look forward to leveraging these innovations to help seniors stay active and engaged.With all our efforts, I am glad to inform Ms Tin Pei Ling that the 2019 Ageing Survey showed that Singaporeans generally had a positive outlook towards ageing. Across all age groups, those who were still working or volunteering were also less likely to describe themselves as old. However, 96% of Singaporeans cited health as the top concern in old age and three in four retirees wished they could have worked longer.As we plan for both seniors of today and tomorrow, we must respond to changing needs and aspirations. As part of the SG Together movement, the Government will engage Singaporeans across all ages to refresh the Action Plan for Successful Ageing, so as to co-create a future where generations of seniors may thrive in. Health and employment will be key focus areas in the Action Plan, to address our seniors' top concerns.Of course, while we strive to make the best of our golden years, most of us will eventually come face to face with creaky knees and back pain. But if we prepare ourselves and plan ahead early, we can better cope with the uncertainty and lengthen the good years of our lives.To that end, we have partnered the Centre for Seniors (CFS) to pilot bite-sized life-stage conversations, with the aim to reach out to some 5,000 mature workers, especially those in their early 50s, through collaborations with companies, union leaders and community organisations over the next two years. The conversations will touch on a wide range of topics such as employment, health and family, to help mature workers prepare themselves early for the transitions in their senior years. As of December, CFS had organised some 63 lunch-time talks for over 2,000 participants.Chairman, speaking from experience, I will now like to urge all younger Singaporeans in their 20s and even younger to prepare early for their golden years, which could so easily come upon us in the blink of an eye. Just like me – Members of this House on the right side of 50, I think would surely understand.Bone health, in particular, deserves our careful attention. With an ageing population, the number of hip fractures has nearly doubled, from 1,500 cases in year 2000 to nearly 3,000 in 2017. About 14% of those with hip fractures pass away within a year of fracture – a sobering statistic. Of the patients who survive, 20% require assistance with activities of daily living. Fractures can have a debilitating effect on our quality of life.2.15 pmTo reduce the risk of fracture when we age, we must start \"saving up\" calcium from young, before we reach maximum bone density at around 30 years old, after which, we can only maintain the density at best. To inculcate the importance of proper nutrition and a healthy lifestyle, HPB will be conducting a pilot outreach to 10 schools on bone health. Besides \"saving up\" calcium in our youth, we must also continually upkeep and prevent depreciation of our assets. In this case, depreciation refers to bone loss.HPB will be working with Osteoporosis Society Singapore to train 300 Bone Health Ambassadors to reach out to more Singaporeans on the importance of a healthy lifestyle and diet, starting in the second half of this year. These ambassadors will help to run public educational sessions, particularly in the area of fall prevention.Dr Lily Neo, Ms Tin Pei Ling and Ms Joan Pereira asked about our progress in supporting seniors to age-in-place. Since 2015, MOH has expanded the number of home and day care places by 70% to support seniors to age-in-place. For nursing homes, we have expanded bed capacity by 30%, we now have sufficient capacity nationwide.Besides expanding capacity, we are also enhancing the scope of services to better address the spectrum of care needs. I announced last year that we will enhance the scope of eldercare centres, to go beyond aged care to social support and preventive health. Currently, MOH funds 82 Senior Activity Centres to provide wellness programmes and social support to residents in rental flats. In the next four years, we will progressively level up and fund at least double the number of eldercare centres to provide an expanded suite of baseline support services for all seniors nationwide and not just those living in rental blocks.Services include active ageing programmes for the well, befriending services for the lonely, and information and referral for care services for our frail seniors.In addition, about half of the eldercare centres will also provide higher level care services, such as day care and community rehabilitation services, to cater to those who are more frail.We also echo Ms Irene Quay’s view that community pharmacists play an important role in ensuring medication adherence in the community. In 2017, of some 517,000 seniors, more than 43% were prescribed five or more regular medications and seen by three or more healthcare providers. Seniors who have multiple co-morbidities often struggle with making sense of many medications from many clinics and the risk of medication error then increases.Thus, MOH conducted a small proof-of-concept for a pharmaceutical care service for 150 seniors at eight eldercare centres last year. Community pharmacists from both private and public healthcare institutions worked with the centres’ care teams to optimise seniors' medications. Through one-to-one sessions with their pharmacists, seniors and their care-givers received tips on managing their medications, including medication packing and management of side effects, so that they may take their medications safely and independently at home. Feedback from participants of the pilot has been positive. Hence, over the next three years, we will be extending the pharmaceutical care service to another 2,500 seniors at more eldercare centres. This will allow us to establish scalable solutions to help seniors manage their medications safely.Besides pharmacists, community nurses pounding the ground complement the role of eldercare partners. To Ms Joan Pereira's question, we have expanded the number of community nursing posts from about 70 a year ago to about 120 community nursing posts today. These are sited at senior activity centres, community centres and religious sites, just to name a few. We now have a pool of 245 community nurses, exceeding our target to recruit 200 community nurses by end 2019. As feedback has been positive, we target to expand our pool to 300 community nurses by 2021. Kudos to our nurses from the Regional Health Clusters, who have attended to 86,000 residents in the community, up from just 33,000 just a year ago. I am glad that not only do our residents cherish our community nurses but nurses, likewise, found their job meaningful, and nearly all of them have stayed on the team since the pilot started. In fact, only one left.This year, as earlier announced by Minister Lawrence Wong, we will also be rolling out another HDB housing type – assisted living flats – to expand the housing options for seniors. The first one will be launched in Bukit Batok. These new assisted living flats are meant to provide seniors with a housing option for independent living, with care available if needed, and a gotong royong spirit amongst neighbours.We co-designed the flats with Singaporeans. In the past year, MOH and MND conducted 14 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with seniors, service providers and healthcare professionals.Chairman, may I display a few slides, please?The Chairman: Yes, please. [Slides were shown to hon Members.]Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan: The FGDs were conducted at these specially constructed mock-up flats and communal living room to help participants better imagine the assisted living experience. It was helpful as participants could give us very specific feedback: a moveable partition between kitchen and sleeping areas, room for a full-sized fridge, and more. We took in all the feedback and improved the design of the housing units, communal living room and basic service package. We are also exploring additional care service options to support frail seniors, such as after-hours care.So, what is the difference between assisted living flats and the range of senior housing options today, such as 2-room flexi-flats? Unlike 2-room flexi-flats, these assisted living flats will be sold, twinned with a service package. Elderly residents will benefit from 24/7 emergency response, as well as the assistance of an on-site community manager.The community manager will monitor the health status of residents and link them up with relevant care services according to their needs. The community manager will also curate programmes to foster a strong sense of neighbourliness, and residents can look forward to mingling at the communal space on every floor – much like the good old kampong days.The first Assisted Living flats in Bukit Batok will be reserved for seniors aged 65 and above. In addition, we will set aside some units where priority will be given to seniors with care needs. More details will be shared in the coming weeks. Planning for a private Assisted Living pilot is also underway. MND and MOH have consulted developers and care operators on this and will announce details later.MOH continuously seeks to wrap care and support around Singaporeans. Dr Lily Neo, Ms Anthea Ong, Mr Daniel Goh and Mr Murali Pillai highlighted the importance of taking this approach for not just physical health but also mental health. I agree and we are embracing this approach. For instance, the HPB promotes both physical and mental health in its preventive health programmes organised in the community and at workplaces.Like a migraine or backache, we should seek help for mental health issues early, so as to avoid problems that are more challenging to address later on. To that end, we have set up 43 community outreach teams and trained over 24,000 frontline staff from Government agencies and community partners across Singapore to identify persons with mental health needs in the community and refer them for appropriate support. As of December 2019, we have reached out to over 300,000 persons and provided assistance to more than 23,000 persons who were at risk of developing mental health conditions or dementia.IMH and the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) have also been driving the “Beyond the Label” national campaign to facilitate more conversations about mental health. This way, we hope to chip away at the stigma associated with mental health and encourage those with mental health issues to seek help promptly.Ms Anthea Ong should also be assured that physicians are bound by duty and ethics to protect patient confidentiality and to ensure data sharing and use for patient care purposes only – for all medical conditions, not just mental health. Healthcare institutions are also required by licensing conditions to safeguard confidentiality of medical records. Specifically, our public healthcare institutions have implemented safeguards to ensure access by authorised users on a need-to-know basis. Severe disciplinary and enforcement actions are taken against users who wilfully breach patient confidentiality. Organisations must also comply with the Personal Data Protection Act.Chairman, over the years, we have expanded our network of partners to ensure that persons with mental health issues can access the support they need. For example, the Institute of Mental Health operates a 24-hour Mental Health Helpline. NCSS has also recently launched a Helpbot named \"Belle\" to provide 24/7 access to consolidated information about helplines and mental health resources, according to what users are looking for. To date, Belle has supported 1,000 users.Community intervention teams have also been established to support partner General Practitioners (GPs) and service providers with allied health services, such as psychotherapy and counselling. Over 26,000 persons have been supported by these teams. In addition, persons with mental health issues who face social and family issues may approach Family Service Centres for counselling support.To date, more than half of our polyclinics provide mental health and dementia services. In addition, over 210 GP partners have been trained to diagnose and support persons with mental health conditions.These services are available to all Singaporeans, irrespective of their specific risk factors, such as disability or gender identity. However, we agree with Ms Yip Pin Xiu and Ms Anthea Ong that care providers need to take into account specific care needs and risk factors.For example, for persons with hearing loss, sign language translators will provide counsellors with the necessary support. The Singapore Association for the Deaf also provides counselling services.Over the next year or so, MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care will be engaging our stakeholders, including disability associations, to identify ways to improve mental health support.As highlighted by Ms Anthea Ong and Mr Daniel Goh, Singaporeans can tap multi-layers of financial support, such as Government subsidies and CHAS, MediShield Life, MediSave and Medifund, for treatment of mental health conditions.MOH reviews the amount of financial support regularly to ensure that they are adequate. For example, the MediSave and MediShield Life claim limits differ across inpatient treatments to reflect different bill sizes. As the bill sizes of inpatient psychiatric treatments are comparatively lower than other inpatient treatments, the MediShield Life and MediSave limits are also correspondingly lower, to cater to different treatment types.Based on the latest available data, fewer than one in 10 subsidised patients exceeded the MediSave yearly withdrawal limit for inpatient psychiatric stays, while fewer than three in 10 subsidised bills exceeded the MediSave daily withdrawal limit. As for MediShield Life, we have been reviewing the claim limits and more details will be announced later this year.For outpatient treatment of mental health conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP), which includes depression, anxiety, including Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) – so, that is included in CDMP – bipolar disorder and schizophrenia – CHAS cardholders may tap on subsidies of up to $500 per year for treatment at CHAS GPs, and more for our Pioneer and Merdeka Generation cardholders. Patients can also withdraw up to $500 per year from their MediSave for outpatient treatment for conditions under the CDMP. In 2018, only about two in 10 patients who withdrew MediSave for their outpatient mental health treatment reached the yearly withdrawal limit. To further defray thecosts for patients with complex chronic conditions, say, a patient with OCD and osteoporosis, we will be raising their MediSave withdrawal limit. Further details on this will be shared by Senior Minister of State Mr Edwin Tong. Singaporeans who still require financial support after tapping these schemes can apply for MediFund from our public healthcare institutions.2.30 pmWe must also not forget that the well-being of persons with mental health conditions often rests on the care-givers, and they are at risk of burnout.Hence, we will be piloting a structured system of support for care-givers of persons with mental health conditions. Under this system, upon first diagnosis of their loved ones, hospitals and community partners will provide care-givers with information, such as disease progression and expected care needs and link them up with the necessary health, financial and social support services. With this, we hope that care-givers will know upfront that they are not alone, that there is an entire network of support for them.Even as we expand our suite of care services for persons with mental health, we must strengthen our multi-pronged strategy to better address mental health and this extends beyond medical care. Hence, in the coming months, we will be undertaking a whole-of-Government review of our mental health strategy, to identify gaps and strengthen existing inter-agency efforts. Besides enhancing support for the mental well-being of seniors, we will also focus on youth mental well-being, which Senior Minister of State Lam will elaborate on.Chairman, in recent months, our healthcare workers are at the frontline, battling against the spread of COVID-19.I will also like to take this opportunity to thank all our healthcare workers who have gone above and beyond their duty to keep us safe. We are grateful, and we will do our utmost to support all of them.I share Assoc Prof Daniel Goh's pride in our nurses. It is unfortunate that some of our nurses were shunned and even berated for wearing their uniforms in public recently. Our nurses wear their uniforms with pride, and I hope members of the public can appreciate and trust their professionalism and affirm their effortsThe work of our healthcare workers is not any easier in \"peacetime\". Healthcare workers sometimes, inadvertently, bear the brunt of patients' and their families' emotions. Under the Protection from Harassment Act, the Government adopts a zero-tolerance policy against the harassment of public healthcare workers performing their official duties. The same Act also protects them as private citizens if they are harassed when off duty. All our public healthcare clusters also have counselling services and hotlines for our healthcare workers if they need help.But the best way to support our healthcare workers is not to react after harm is done but to refrain from taking out our stress on them. I urge Singaporeans to take a moment to recognise their efforts, and I am heartened by those who have rallied behind them.Chairman, our healthcare workers are truly the backbone of our healthcare system. Battling COVID-19 is but the latest example. Their role will only continue to grow in importance. As care needs increase in our ageing population, we will need a steady pipeline of dedicated healthcare workers. Manpower is a perennial challenge, but on the flipside, it is also an opportunity for Singaporeans who seek a meaningful career.We have made some headway in growing the number of healthcare workers. For instance, the number of practising nurses has grown by 3.3% per annum in the past five years. In comparison, Singapore's total employment grew by 1.1% per annum over the same period.With the expansion of services, we could see up to around 6,000 additional jobs in the healthcare sector in the next two years. This is on top of hiring to replace attrition. We will continue our efforts to attract and recruit Singaporeans to build a strong local core in our workforce.However, with shrinking birth cohorts, the labour market will become much tighter in the decade beyond 2020. To meet our growing manpower needs, we must rethink our current approach and find creative ways to attract and retain people in the sector, particularly in the growing community care sector.First, we need to diversify our hiring sources. Besides attracting fresh graduates, we will continue our efforts to bring mid-careerists into healthcare. Mid-careerists play a valuable role as they bring with them unique expertise and fresh perspectives from their previous careers. In the last two years, about 2,000 local mid-career PMETs transited into the healthcare sector, and about one-third of them are mature workers aged 40 and above.Besides healthcare staff, there are many administrative positions available in the healthcare sector too. Take, for example, Ms Noraini, who joined Ren Ci Hospital after spending more than 20 years as a special needs educator and then as a business executive. Ms Noraini's experience placed her in good stead for her role as a resident care manager in Ren Ci Hospital.Nevertheless, to support her transition into the community care sector, Ren Ci Hospital placed Ms Noraini under the Senior Management Associate Scheme (SMAS). When she completes her induction programme this year, Ms Noraini can continue to attend leadership programmes to support her development.Second, we must invest in our people, especially in the community care sector, to enable the shift of care beyond hospital to community.To support the attraction and retention of manpower in this sector, MOH previously funded a total of $350 million between 2012 and 2017 to community care institutions to raise salaries for their staff. Around 90% of MOH-funded institutions participated in this exercise.Over the next three years, MOH will set aside another $150 million to support community care institutions to further improve the competitiveness of salaries. We project that this will benefit up to 4,000 local nurses and support care staff, if it is fully taken up. After these three years, MOH will factor in the higher salary levels in our funding to community care providers.We strongly encourage employers to take the opportunity to enhance salaries of nurses and support care staff and continue to improve career prospects of our care staff in the community.We are also eager to bring non-practising nurses back to our healthcare family. Over the past four years, about 500 local nurses have returned to practice annually. Returning nurses may undergo a refresher course under the Return to Nursing scheme, and those who return to the community care sector are eligible for a retention bonus of up to $5,000. In response to Mr Melvin Yong, MOH has been actively working with the union and employers on the retention and development of our healthcare workforce.I also echo Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Christopher de Souza's call to continue supporting professional growth and development for nurses and allied health professionals.Last year, we launched the Skills Frameworks for allied health workers and medical social workers, just to name a few. This year, I am pleased to launch the Community Nursing Competency Framework, which can be used by community nurses and employers as a guide to identify skills gaps and pursue development opportunities.From this year onwards, fresh school leavers and in-service staff may apply for the new Community Care Scholarship to take up programmes relevant for the community care sector, such as in the disciplines of Occupational Therapy and Social Work.Besides training, we must also create opportunities for our healthcare workers to take on leadership positions in the sector.Nurses, in particular, play a leading role in care delivery in the community care sector and we must nurture those with strong clinical skills and leadership potential.Let me share the story of Assoc Prof Edward Poon. He started as a staff nurse at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) before joining the community care sector early in his career. Over time, he took on various leadership positions and he is now Director of Nursing at St Luke's Eldercare (SLEC).Assoc Prof Poon's impact extends beyond SLEC. In addition to upholding and maintaining the quality of care at SLEC, he also conducts training for the sector and collaborates with public hospitals on geriatric research.We hope there will be more budding professionals who will go on to take on nursing leadership roles in the community care sector, just like Assoc Prof Poon. Hence, we will be introducing a new Community Care Nursing Leadership Programme this year, to groom the next generation of nursing leaders for the sector. Regardless of their current place of practice, all experienced Registered Nurses who want to take on leadership roles in the community care sector are welcome to apply.The programme will provide nurses with opportunities in clinical training, leadership development, attachments and mentorship.Lastly, all of us must find ways to eliminate unnecessary workload and adopt best practices to work smarter. This would include process and role redesign as pointed out by Ms Irene Quay.Collaborative prescribing is one example. Since 2019, 34 advanced practice nurses and 31 clinical pharmacists in 11 healthcare institutions have been trained and empowered to prescribe drugs to their patients. We hope more institutions and professionals will come on board in the near future.In response to Ms Irene Quay, employers may already choose to go beyond the minimum provisions in the Employment Act to accept medical certificates or time chits issued by allied health professionals.In respond to Mr Faisal Manap, the regulatory scope of the new Healthcare Services Act (HCSA) includes traditional and complementary medicine services. MOH will monitor the prevalence of use and risks to patient safety, before considering whether to license these services under HCSA. Nonetheless, traditional and complementary medicine practitioners are already subject to relevant provisions under the Medicines Act and the Sales of Drugs Act, just to name a few.Chairman, even as we face shrinking birth cohorts, we are also presented with the gift of longer health-adjusted life expectancy, which we can capitalise. Singaporeans are living longer and healthier and we should allow them to continue contributing, if they wish to.This is a win-win scenario for both employers and employees. In 2019, around 99% of public healthcare workers aged 62 and beyond were offered re-employment and 95% of them accepted the offer.To support our mature healthcare workers who are able and willing to continue working, MOH has worked with the Healthcare Services Employees' Union and public healthcare institutions to raise the retirement age to 63, and re-employment age to 68 from July 2021 onwards – one year ahead of the national schedule. Those who wish to retire or stop working at 62 may still do so whilst those who want to keep working now have the choice to work even longer.In closing, it is our unending pursuit to find ways for each of us to age healthier, happier and in a fulfilling manner. I want to urge all Singaporeans – young and old – to help us achieve this.The Chairman: Ms Irene Quay.Antimicrobial ResistanceMs Irene Quay Siew Ching: Mr Chairman, I refer to the nationwide curbing of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), an issue which I have also spoken on before on the need for us to curb AMR through legislative changes.AMR is a major global threat that persists and will continue to worsen if left unchecked. I do not speak this lightly, but the potential fatal consequences of AMR will surpass that of SARS, H1N1, Ebola, MERs-CoV and COVID-19 combined.A quote from England Chief Medical Officer, Dr Dame Sally Davies, \"The threat of antibiotic resistance is as great as that from climate change.\" This imminent danger is a result of antibiotic overuse, misuse and the lack of regulation.A local study reporting a 10-year review of AMR in Singapore noted a marked difference in the community rectal carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, that is, 6.3% in 2006 versus 26% in 2016 between two dissimilar surveys, appearing to signify an increasing trend despite the differences in methodology.It is therefore with all urgency that I ask if MOH has any data to share on antibiotic usage in the community?I understand that the antimicrobial stewardship programme has been well established in our public institutions. May I ask if MOH has considered funding for such antimicrobial surveillance programme in the community, where the majority of our primary healthcare is provided by private practices?I would also like to request for an update on the progress of the National Strategic Action Plan on AMR.2.45 pmPrevention and Early Detection of DiseasesDr Lily Neo: Mr Chairman, I want to start by commending MOH as well as other Ministries in their efforts in tackling COVID-19 and limiting its spread, that has impressed WHO.Healthcare workers' calling and dedication are at the greatest committal situation presently; knowing that while looking after the sick, there is possibility that they and their family members may also get sick as a result of COVID-19. May I also encourage all our healthcare workers in both the public and private sectors, especially those in the frontline, to keep up their good work and keep their spirits high. May I also thank all other frontline workers that help us in limiting the transmission of COVID-19.I hope MOH will spare no effort in sharpening its future preparedness by enhancing this episode’s good practices and registering and correcting its shortfall. There may be areas that need attention, such as being self sufficient with locally manufactured preventive and protective items, for example masks, and enhancing our health scientist sector capability to fight viruses.Adherence to a healthy lifestyle is associated with a lower risk of mortality. It reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as type-2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and disability. May I ask MOH if there are new initiatives to assist more Singaporeans to achieve healthy living?Diabetes and hypertension can cause heart disease, renal failure and so on. Compliance on diet and medication are key factors on the outcome on war on diabetes. Can MOH promote and motivate more healthcare providers and patients themselves to achieve it?A local study found that the proportion of older adults with three or more chronic diseases nearly doubled from 2009 to 2017. If diabetes and hypertension are detected earlier, there will be lesser morbidity and disability amongst the seniors. All senior care centers can be tasked to assist detecting and maintaining good control for these two chronic conditions.Breast cancer remains the most frequent cancer among women in Singapore, and approximately 6% of all women will be diagnosed with invasive disease in their lifetime. The underlying premise for breast cancer screening is that it allows for the detection of breast cancers before they become palpable. Small tumors are more likely to be early stage disease, having better prognosis, and are more successfully treated.May I ask MOH on the percentage of women screened yearly and the percentage in detecting smaller treatable breast cancers? And how to improve its take-up rate?Colorectal cancer is now the commonest cancer in Singapore. The average population risk for developing colorectal cancer in Singapore is among the highest in the world. Most colorectal cancers develop from adenomatous polyps, thus its early detection and removal reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. Pre-malignant period of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence makes it ideal to screen for colorectal cancer and such screening has been proven to save lives. Will Minister consider subsidised colonoscopy screening, as it is more accurate and is also preventive in nature by removing polyps early, compared to present occult blood testing?Cervical cancer is the sixth most common cancer among Singapore women. The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent of essentially all cervical cancer cases. Because of this fact, and the fact that there are HPV vaccines that protect against infection with HPV, some countries like Holland and Australia are adopting a HPV DNA assays as primary screening methodology for cervical cancer prevention. Will MOH adopt the same strategy for better cervical cancer prevention?Stomach Cancer is the seventh most common cancer in men and the ninth in women here. Every year stomach cancer takes more than 300 lives in Singapore. Chronic infection with Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori), a bacterium that lives in the mucous lining of the stomach, may increase the risk for stomach cancer. H Pylori infection is a common infection in Singapore affecting about 31% of the population, and infection increases to 71% in adults above 65 years. H Pylori is an important pathogen that can be treated with antibiotics and should be eradicated if detected.A recently published report of a working group of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the WHO concluded that-randomised clinical trials have found that H pylori treatment is effective in preventing gastric cancer, and models indicate that H pylori screening and treatment strategies would becost-effective. Will MOH raise the awareness on this finding and look into the feasibility of population based screening and prevention of stomach cancer?Adult VaccinationsMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member): Mr Chairman, Sir, based on the reply to my Parliamentary Question (PQ) last month, after the launch of the National Adult Immunisation Schedule in 2017, the take-up rate for adult vaccination rose, but is still way below that of some other developed countries. For example, for flu vaccines among seniors, our take-up rate may be around 24% versus 70% in the UK, US and Australia.Can we do more to promote adult vaccination? For example, the Government works with employers to conduct health screenings, can those same platforms, events and working relationships be used to offer on-the-spot vaccinations to workers and companies?Can we also do more to nudge GPs to display material in their clinics that prompts patients to ask for vaccinations. Of course, price is always a consideration, as many would want to conserve their MediSave for other future needs. I would repeat my call made in Parliament for the level of subsidy given for adult vaccines to take into consideration the downstream fiscalcost savings to the state from fewer diseases as a result of vaccines.Finally, our child vaccination coverage for measles, for example, is high at around 95%. But in 2019 there were 152 measles cases, which was the highest number of cases since 1997. MOH figures also showed that there were several hundred cases of mumps every year since 2012.In response to a PQ about measures to prevent measles outbreaks, the Minister for Health opined that passivity could explain most of the cases of children not being vaccinated.However, the growth of anti-vaccination beliefs worldwide should not be under-estimated. I would like to ask for an update on what measures MOH is planning to reduce the numbers of children not receiving these essential vaccinations.Do all childcare centres require vaccinations certificates before enrollment? Can we do more, for example, working with pre-school centres and private enrichment programme centres to flag out cases of non-vaccinated children?Health Promotion and Preventive HealthMr Charles Chong (Punggol East): Mr Chairman, in October last year, MOH announced new measures which would affect the marketing of high sugar drinks. Now, I applaud this move, as consumption and availability of highly sugared drinks continue to be a great impediment on our war on diabetes. In announcing the new measures, MOH said that more details about the measures affecting highly sugared drinks would be released in 2020. I would, therefore, like to ask the Minister if MOH has crystallised its policy on highly sugared drinks and if he can provide an update on this?Sir, on smoking, I would like to ask the Minister about measures which are available to assist persons to quit smoking. Smoking's popularity has been in decline, as more people understand the health risks associated with smoking. I hope we can do more to discourage people from smoking and even more to encourage smokers to quit. Could the Minister provide us an update on the measures which have been put in place to assist smokers to quit and how successful has this been?In 2018, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health said that MOH was aiming to bring the smoking rate to below 10% by 2020 – this year. Could the Minister provide an update on how successful we have been at reducing the smoking rate?And finally, Mr Chairman, I would like to ask the Minister about what we can do or what has been done to encourage Singaporeans to take preventive measures for the sake of their health such as getting regular health screenings done and having vaccinations performed when they are needed. Could the Minister let us know how successful MOH's \"Screen for Life\" programmes have been and how many Singaporeans have taken advantage of the subsidised screening under under the programme? Are there any plans to expand \"Screen for Life\" to beyond what they really are, just basic level tests?Curbs on High-sugar ProductsMr Leon Perera: Sir, the Government has introduced mandatory front-of-pack nutrition labels for less healthy pre-packaged sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and advertising bans for the least healthy SSBs on local mass media channels. More than 30 countries have introduced such labels. In Chile, the sales of drinks with the unhealthy labels fell by 25% after one-and-a-half years. However, with the daily sugar intake of Singaporeans more than double that of the level recommended by the World Health Organization, could we go farther?Could MOH consider reviewing the results of these moves and if these are not effective consider adopting to some degree and in a tiered and calibrated fashion the measures that have been adopted for tobacco products, such as more graphic warning labels and packaging?A study by researchers at Harvard in 2018 suggested that graphic warning labels on sugary drinks reduced purchases more than text-based labels.Research funded by the UK's Department of Health also suggests that removing products from choice locations within a retail outlet – for example, at the check-out counter where impulse buying is common – can reduce sales. While product placement is negotiated in contractual agreement between the sellers and the retailers, it may be necessary to explore nudging retailers to move in this direction in time though, of course, not without industry consultation and piloting.Industry buy-in for such moves may be facilitated by the fact that many of the firms producing high sugar food and beverage products are gradually seeking to shift revenue share to healthier products over time, as they see the writing on the wall globally.The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Dr Lam Pin Min.The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min): Mr Chairman, for Singaporeans to continue to have good access to quality and affordable healthcare, we must press on to transform our healthcare system in the long-run, even as we face threats like COVID-19.With Singaporeans living longer, primary care plays increasingly crucial roles in maintaining one’s health throughout their lives. Our Vision, “One Singaporean, One Family Doctor”, remains relevant while we provide all Singaporeans with affordable and quality care, near their homes. Mr Chairman, may I display some slides, please.The Chairman: Yes, please. [Slides were shown to hon Members.]Dr Lam Pin Min: I announced in 2018 that our network of polyclinics will be expanded to 30-32 polyclinics by 2030, from 20 today. Since then, we have announced 10 new polyclinics, six of which will open by 2023.In response to Mr Chong Kee Hiong's feedback for a polyclinic in Bishan, as well as Mr Sitoh Yih Pin’s suggestion to build one in Bidadari, I am glad to say that your prayers have been answered. We will be developing a polyclinic in each of these areas by 2030. With Bishan and Bidadari polyclinics, we will achieve our target of having 32 polyclinics by 2030.To Dr Chia Shi-Liu's query, the new polyclinics will offer similar services as existing ones, including medical treatment for acute conditions, chronic disease management, women’s and children’s health services, and radiological, laboratory and pharmacy services.Dr Chia also asked about our primary care transformation journey. This involves promoting a regular family doctor, which is important for continuity of care, especially for patients with chronic diseases who need long-term follow-up.To work towards this goal, we shared last year that polyclinics are scaling up team-based care, where patients with chronic diseases see a regular care team.We are not far from achieving this goal in the private primary care sector too – two-thirds of Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) cardholders with chronic diseases have a regular doctor. This demonstrates how integral private sector General Practitioners (GPs) are to our primary care transformation efforts, which brings me to Mr Chong’s and Dr Chia's queries about support for GPs in providing better and more holistic care.Besides supporting them in their professional development, I will share more later, we have been partnering them to anchor and provide holistic chronic disease management through the Primary Care Networks (PCNs). Similar to polyclinics, PCNs are embracing team-based care.Thanks to their support, we are on track to have at least half of CHAS GP clinics participating in the PCN by end 2020. More than 500 PCN GP clinic partners are caring for over 100,000 patients with chronic conditions, up from about 70,000 last year.One of these patients is Mdm Lam. She was diagnosed to have diabetes and hypertension in 2007 and started visiting Jurong polyclinic to manage her chronic conditions. In 2015, she switched to Frontier Family Medicine Clinic (FMC) as she wanted to have one regular doctor to help manage her medical conditions holistically. She has also enjoyed having Frontier FMC closer to her home.Since then, she has been regularly consulting Dr Thia, whom she is now very comfortable with and who is familiar with her medical conditions. With Frontier FMC joining the PCN in 2018, Mdm Lam also benefited from team-based care, including nurse counselling, and diabetic foot and eye screening. Now, Mdm Lam does not have to run around for multiple appointments as the PCN clinic coordinator ensures her screenings are done conveniently at the clinic on the same day as her consultation with Dr Thia. She is grateful her care team has helped her understand her medical conditions better, and that has helped her improve and keep her medical conditions in check3.00 pmWith the continued expansion of the PCN, more patients like Mdm Lam will benefit from this scheme.Like chronic diseases, early detection and management of cancer can make a world of difference in health outcomes. We would like to thank Dr Lily Neo for her suggestions to improve screening and follow-up.The screening rate for breast cancer is about 39% and the rate of late-stage breast cancer diagnosis has remained around 28% between 2008 and 2017. There is therefore room for improvement. Oftentimes, all that is needed is a change in mindset. Misconceptions and fears are common barriers – thinking that screening is not necessary when one feels healthy, that \"it is better not to know\", and that mammograms are painful, are just some of the examples.To counter these, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) holds annual breast cancer awareness campaigns, conducts on-the-ground activities and uses social media to expand their reach. They will continue to work with partners to encourage more women to go for screening regularly.To enhance the take-up rate, breast cancer screening must also be made accessible and affordable. In this regard, the Singapore Cancer Society (SCS), Breast Cancer Foundation (BCF) and the National Healthcare Group Diagnostics (NHGD) introduced the Community Mammobus programme, where the first mammogram is free of charge and subsequent ones are $10 for Singaporeans. About 9,300 individuals have benefited from this programme since its launch in 2018.Mr Charles Chong asked whether there are plans to expand Screen for Life to include additional tests, and Dr Lily Neo also suggested alternative screening tests for selected cancers such as colorectal cancer and also mentioned about the Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) test for stomach cancer. MOH and HPB refer to the Screening Test Review Committee's (STRC) recommendations in deciding which screening tests to provide at a population level. These are based on robust scientific evidence to ensure that they are safe, effective, suitable andcost-effective.On colorectal cancer, both the Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) and the screening colonoscopy are recommended for population-level screening. However, the screening colonoscopy has risks due to its invasive nature. Conversely, the FIT kit can be safely and conveniently administered by the individual at home.Under Screen for Life, subsidised FIT is available at all CHAS GP clinics and those who test positive are referred for subsidised diagnostic colonoscopies. Screening colonoscopies are still available at Public sector hospitals and are MediSave-claimable should one choose to go for them instead.On cervical cancer, HPV-DNA testing for women aged 30 to 69 was introduced in mid-2019, following STRC's recommendation due to its higher sensitivity and lower frequency required, compared to the Pap smear.MOH and our partners will keep on striving to encourage more Singaporeans to go for early screening and follow-up, and update our strategies when new evidence arises.Mental well-being continues to be a top concern based on recent engagements with youths, which highlights the need to do more. Mr Melvin Yong and Dr Lily Neo, amongst many others, have recognised this and have asked how we can improve youth mental health services and make them more accessible.Minister Indranee Rajah has announced MOE's efforts to further support student well-being through mental health education and peer support cultures in schools. Complementing MOE's efforts, we announced last year that we will work with the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and our community partner, Care Corner, to develop an Integrated Youth Service (IYS), where youths at risk can access coordinated mental health and social support services in the community.I am glad to update that the Integrated Youth Service will be starting in Woodlands this year. Care Corner will reach out to youths at risk and raise awareness on mental well-being and resilience. They will also provide individualised emotional support, needs identification and peer support services, and refer those who require further intervention to appropriate health and social services.Moving forward, we will continue to take a whole-of-society approach and work with other Ministries to address youth mental health needs. This includes MOE, MSF, MCCY, including their National Youth Council (NYC), on the recently announced Youth Mental Well-being Network.As mentioned by Minister Gan, we must continue to move beyond quality to value. He shared that about 50% of the rise in healthcarecosts is due to higher utilisation and another 15% partly due to increases incosts of drugs and medical devices. We are therefore employing a suite of strategies to increase value and lowercosts so that all Singaporeans can access care without experiencing financial hardship. Let me elaborate.One of these strategies is the introduction of surgeon fee benchmarks for common surgical procedures in the private sector last year. Anyone, including doctors, patients and payers, can refer to them on the MOH website. I am glad to share that since its publication, surgical fees have generally converged, with the majority falling within range and more than 80% below the upper limit. We also saw a slight reduction in the average fees.Our work does not stop here. We will keep monitoring the charges, seek feedback from stakeholders, and review the benchmarks with the Fee Benchmarks Advisory Committee (FBAC), so that they remain relevant and effective.Building on this, the committee is studying expansion to surgical fees for less common procedures, doctors' inpatient consultation fees and other fee components like anaesthetist's fees, and plans to submit its recommendations later this year. With these efforts, all of us will be able to make more informed decisions and benefit from greater transparency of fees.We have also implemented measures to reduce drugcosts, including switching to generic drugs where possible. Generic drugs or biosimilars are medicines which are clinically equivalent to branded or originator drugs and typicallycost much less. If used appropriately, both patients and our healthcare system can benefit from enormouscost savings without compromising safety and quality of care.To encourage Public healthcare institutions to use more of such drugs, MOH works with the National Pharmacy and Therapeutics (NPT) Committee every year to select a basket of drugs which can be switched, and reviews their utilisation annually. In 2018, the usage of generics in the basket increased to more than 90% by volume. We will continue to work with the committee and Public healthcare institutions to increase uptake and thereforecost savings.We have also set up the Agency for Logistics Procurement and Supply (ALPS) in July 2018 to pool together supply chain functions and resources across our three healthcare clusters to achieve greater economies of scale. With ALPS, 85% of drugs used in clusters were purchased on national group contracts in 2018. Today, this proportion has increased to 95%, resulting in clusters saving at least 5% in drugcosts, benefiting our patients in turn. For example, thecost of drugs for epilepsy was reduced by up to 85%.Building on these efforts, ALPS will work with relevant agencies to encourage greater entry of generics and new sources of drugs in Singapore and launch different approaches in strategic sourcing and procurement to keep drug prices competitive.We must not only reducecosts, but ensure that our limited resources are spent on care that is of value.The Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE) conducts health technology assessments (HTA) to facilitate clinically-effective andcost-effective care, and negotiates with manufacturers to attain fair prices for selected health technologies. Their work has improved access and affordability for over 50,000 patients. Of note, they managed to cut down the prices of medicines such as those for Hepatitis C by more than half.ACE is on track to deliver savings of $75 million over five years, and will work on benefiting even more Singaporeans.MOH also introduced the Value-Driven Care (VDC) programme to deliver good health outcomes in a value-conscious manner. We are extracting value for the 17 high-volume, high-cost and therefore, high-impact conditions under this programme.Since May last year, we have been sharing data across providers to identify areas of improvement and facilitate sharing of best practices. As we are still at early stages, we will continue to monitor the programme's impact. At the same time, we are expanding our scope by identifying additional conditions and increasing the period of analysis.MOH and healthcare providers will work together on these on-going efforts to containcosts and ensure that all Singaporeans can access quality care. As individuals, we can also play our part too, by discussing with our healthcare providers on appropriate treatments for our conditions, and financial support available, if needed.MOH is committed to supporting the development of healthcare professionals. Today, ACE publishes Appropriate Care Guides (ACGs) to help healthcare professionals optimise patient outcomes. To support them further, ACE will be launching a national educational visiting service known as ACE Clinical Update Service (ACE CUES) in the second half of this year.While educational visiting may be a new term to many of the Members here, it has been made available in a number of countries, including Australia, US, Canada and Norway, and is shown in many studies to improve patient care and outcomes. Through educational visiting, best available evidence and information materials on patient care are brought to healthcare professionals at their workplace, where one-to-one, focused and customised discussions are held at their convenience.A range of clinical topics will be covered over time, the first being asthma, which affects many people of all ages, most of which are being managed in primary care settings by GPs. As there have been recent major developments in asthma treatment, it is timely for ACE CUES to bring these updates to GPs nationwide to benefit their patients, starting with those in the PCNs.Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked for an update on integrated personalised medicine into our healthcare eco-system.In Singapore, healthcare demands are changing fundamentally, driven by a rapidly ageing population and increased chronic disease prevalence. MOH is examining ways to be future-ready to ensure that healthcare delivery evolves to address these demands and adopts innovative approaches to transform healthcare while mitigatingcosts.Precision medicine is one such promising area. Work on the national strategy for precision medicine research and implementation has been on-going. It aims to accelerate health research and develop peaks of research excellence for Singapore, and, ultimately, to improve health by identifying clinical applications that arecost-effective, sustainable and relevant.The official launch of the precision medicine strategy and research programme is currently planned for the third or fourth quarter of this year, and more details will be made available later.Let me come to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Ms Irene Quay asked for an update on the National Strategic Action Plan (NSAP) on antimicrobial resistance and the measures MOH is taking to optimise antibiotic use and enhance surveillance.Following the launch of the action plan in 2017, we set up the Antimicrobial Resistance Coordinating Office (AMRCO) under the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) to oversee its implementation. To enhance surveillance, AMRCO is extending AMR surveillance and tracking of antimicrobial utilisation, already in place for public hospitals, to private hospitals and primary care. Guidelines for healthcare professionals on the management of infections and antimicrobial use are also being developed.In addition, AMRCO, together with MOH and partner agencies such as the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), National Parks Board (NParks), NEA and PUB, is examining an integrated approach to surveillance.As a first step, the First Joint Report of Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance in Singapore will be published this year. Singapore also enrolled in WHO's Global AMR Surveillance System (GLASS) to contribute surveillance data and learn from other countries' experiences.3.15 pmAll of us have a role to play in preventing antimicrobials resistance too by using antimicrobials appropriately. HPB will continue its \"Use Antibiotics Right\" public education campaign to address common misperceptions, increase awareness and encourage patients to discuss appropriate antibiotic use with their doctors.We generally take a collaborative approach for public health programmes. We have benefited from close cooperation with the public and our stakeholders, and will continue to work together to improve public health for all. While much has already been done, our healthcare transformation journey does not end here.As we continue to move beyond Healthcare to Health, beyond Hospital to Community and beyond Quality to Value, we need to keep in mind that success goes beyond having the right policies in place – the backing and invaluable cooperation and contributions of healthcare providers and citizens are paramount. With that said, let’s continue to work towards achieving our shared goal of accessible, affordable and quality care for all, so that we can remain a healthy nation for generations to come.The Chairman: Mr Gan Thiam Poh.Prevention of DiabetesMr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio): Chairman, while all of us are preoccupied with COVID-19, it is important for us not to forget about another health risk – diabetes. Diabetes can lead to health complications such as kidney failure, heart attack and stroke. One in nine Singaporean adults were affected by diabetes in 2010. As our population ages, the prevalence of this disease will increase as the risk increases with age. Rising obesity also contributes to the prevalence of diabetes in our population.Unfortunately, Singaporeans face many sugary temptations in their food and beverage choices daily. We may be able to resist snacks and so on, but most people will get a couple of drinks in the course of the day which are often loaded with sugar. These include coffees, teas, soft drinks and even purportedly healthy beverages such as freshly squeezed juices and herbal drinks. Will the Ministry share an update on the measures to control sugar-sweetened beverage consumption?Health of Low-income SingaporeansThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministers for Culture, Community and Youth and Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng): Mr Chairman, good health is not something we can buy, nor can it be taken away by people. One golden rule to good health is regular exercise, which can be free of charge, for example running. The other is a balanced diet. Food is not free, but the best and healthiest choice is home-cooked food. Buying fresh produce and cooking at home is generally cheaper than eating out.I have come across low-income families who do not cook. One common reason is lack of time, because some have more than one jobs to make ends meet. I especially worry for their kids who might resort to convenience food like instant noodles, which offer little nutrition. I have also met some seniors who live by themselves in rental flats. It is too much of a hassle for them to cook for themselves or he could be a widower who does not cook.So, I would like MOH to share if it has done some studies on this issue and how it plans to help low-income Singaporeans.The Chairman: Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim. Take your two cuts together.Prevention Better than CureThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim): The phrase \"prevention is better than cure\" is often used to encourage people to adopt preventive health measures in their lives. I commend the Health Promotion Board and other stakeholders who have passionately and persistently engaged Singaporeans to take on preventive health measures at the community and national levels.As we move forward, I would like to ask how will MOH encourage Singaporeans across all ages to take on preventive health measures, such as doing timely health screening, vaccination and quit smoking?Support to Community ProvidersHealthcare is not one size-fits-all, and often community providers are best able to customise services to fit the needs of local populations or vernacular groups.Over the years, we have seen many community providers coming forward to play a part and contribute towards a healthier Singapore. These community providers have helped to empower Singaporeans to lead a more active lifestyle and taking ownership of their health.As good health and active lifestyle are expected to continue to be an important national agenda, I would like to know how the Ministry is supporting these community providers, especially during this COVID-19 period?Community Care ProvidersMr Charles Chong: Mr Chairman, the speaker before has already said all the things that I wanted to say. So, I shall not repeat them, other than to say that I support what Assoc Prof Dr Faishal Ibrahim has said. [Laughter.]The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong.The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai): Mr Chairman, as the Minister for Health has shared, we have delivered on our Healthcare 2020 objectives, including having Minister Gan remain as the Health Minister till now.Today, Singaporeans live longer, healthier lives than when we made these goals in 2012. We enjoy some of the best healthcare in the world, and this remains affordable and also accessible to all. But the future will bring new challenges, and we cannot afford to rest on our laurels. It will take bold steps – from Government and the community in partnership – to ensure that we can continue keeping these commitments to our citizens.Our healthcare financing system has weathered the test of time. Each financing scheme plays a unique role in ensuring that no Singaporean will be denied appropriate care because of an inability to pay.First, Singaporeans enjoy means-tested subsidies across public healthcare settings, covering up to 80% of thecosts of treatment. Singaporeans are also covered by MediShield Life for large hospitalisation bills andcostly outpatient treatments. Coverage starts from the moment one is born, and is for life. Next, MediSave helps Singaporeans set aside some income towards future healthcare needs. It can be used to offset out-of-pocket expenses and also pay for health insurance premiums. Finally, MediFund provides a safety net for those facing financial difficulty.This framework has worked well for us. Seven in 10 subsidised hospitalisations by Singaporeans do not incur any out-of-pocket expenses or payment, while eight in 10 incur payments of less than $100. Still, we regularly review each pillar of healthcare financing to give Singaporeans peace of mind in seeking the care they need.As our population ages, we can expect more Singaporeans to face chronic conditions. Ms Tin Pei Ling asked how we are supporting chronic disease patients, and Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked specifically about what we can do to encourage them to seek early intervention in the community.In June 2018, we raised MediSave withdrawal limits for conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme or CDMP, from $400 to $500. We also expanded CDMP to cover ischaemic heart disease and pre-diabetes. Today, CDMP covers 20 conditions, including four mental health conditions: schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety. We regularly review the list of CDMP conditions in consultation with clinical experts, and will include conditions such as eczema in our review.Last November, we introduced higher subsidies for complex chronic conditions for CHAS Blue and CHAS Orange card-holders, and also expanded CHAS Orange to cover common illnesses. We also launched the CHAS Green card – part of a wider initiative to shift healthcare beyond hospitals and into the community. All Singaporeans are now eligible for subsidised CDMP treatments at CHAS GP clinics, regardless of income levels. This represents a fundamental shift in primary care financing, with universal subsidies for GP treatment.Ms Irene Quay asked for an update on the success of these measures. Let me just outline the broad parameters with reference to a few facts. I am happy to share that around 200,000 Singaporeans received their CHAS Green cards in 2019, entitling them to the programme that I have just outlined a moment ago. Altogether, 1.7 million Singaporeans have received their CHAS cards, seven times more than when CHAS was first launched in 2012.With our continuing efforts to bring more clinics onto the scheme, CHAS card-holders can now receive subsidised treatment at close to 2,000 GP and dental clinics island-wide. In 2019, we disbursed more than $160 million in CHAS subsidies, significantly alleviating thecost of outpatient treatments for Singaporeans.This year, we will be further expanding the use of MediSave for CDMP treatments in outpatient settings. Currently, Singaporeans can tap on the MediSave500 scheme for CDMP treatments, for approved vaccinations and screenings. From 2021, we will increase support for patients with complex chronic conditions by raising their annual withdrawal limit from $500 to $700. Patients with complex chronic conditions include those who have visits for two or more CDMP conditions, or one CDMP condition with complications, within a year. This is aligned with the higher CHAS subsidies we implemented for complex chronic patients in November. In effect, rather than MediSave500, these patients will in fact benefit from an extension of the scheme, or MediSave700.Administratively, we will align MediSave500 with all other MediSave schemes, shifting from a per-account to a per-patient limit. Overall, we expect more than 176,000 patients to benefit from the enhanced MediSave700 scheme.Ms Tin Pei Ling asked us to consider greater flexibility in the MediSave withdrawal limits, especially for seniors with significant balances. I believe Mr Pritam Singh also raised the same issue. We have been working to increase flexibility under MediSave in a few key areas. Let me outline them.First, covering new treatments and services. We are expanding MediSave to cover severe disability under the upcoming MediSave for Long-Term Care scheme. With cash withdrawals, patients will also have greater flexibility to choose appropriate care options, relevant for themselves and their particular circumstances. Second, increasing flexibility within existing schemes. So, first we cover new schemes and new treatments, and second, we look at increasing flexibility within the scheme itself. One example is lowering the age threshold for Flexi-MediSave in 2018 from 65 to 60. Another example is the MediSave700 scheme I have just outlined. The higher withdrawal limits increase flexibility for patients with complex chronic conditions, as they are likely to incur highercosts for their CDMP treatments.Overall, these enhancements are designed to strike a balance, as we have to continue to do, between current medical expenses and of course, future healthcare needs down the road. We will continue to take on board the suggestions, review our MediSave withdrawal limits in light of our overall financing framework, to introduce greater flexibility where possible, and to ensure that they are adequate for the majority of patients in subsidised settings.Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked how we can plan to keep healthcare affordable for elderly Singaporeans. The three pillars of our long-term care financing framework – CareShield Life, MediSave Withdrawals for Long-Term Care, and ElderFund – mirror the \"3M\" schemes that we have for acute care, and that has worked well for us. They complement existing subsidies of up to 80% for long-term care services, such as day care and home care.The first two pillars represent significant changes. CareShield Life provides better protection for severely disabled policyholders with lifetime payouts. MediSave Withdrawals for Long-Term Care, or MediSave Care for short, will allow Singaporeans to withdraw directly from their MediSave in cash, providing flexibility for long-term care expenses. Both schemes will be launched later this year.Assoc Prof Daniel Goh asked how we are supporting families who might fall outside of the subsidy thresholds. So, we have those within the framework, that I have just outlined. What happens to those who might fall outside the subsidy thresholds? First, let me clarify that the current income criterion of $2,800 for long-term care subsidies covers close to two-thirds of resident households in Singapore. The median household income per member quoted by Assoc Prof Goh includes the employer CPF contributions, which we exclude in assessing the eligibility for subsidies.The figure is also based on all employed households, and does not consider households with no working persons. Elderly households, or households with elderly members, tend to have a lower income per household member. Hence, a larger proportion of such households will qualify for subsidies, with many qualifying for the maximum rate of subsidies.Together with CareShield Life and other schemes highlighted by Assoc Prof Goh, most Singaporeans will be adequately covered for basic long-term care needs. In addition, as I mentioned to the House last year, we will allow private insurers to introduce additional severe disability coverage on top of CareShield Life, with premiums payable from MediSave.3.30 pmThe third pillar is ElderFund, a safety net for lower income and severely disabled Singaporeans. It supports those who are unable to benefit from schemes like ElderShield with monthly cash payouts, and opened for applications on 31 January.Mr Faisal Manap asked if patients with physical impairments can obtain support from MediFund for transportationcosts. This is an area where new measures complement the existing schemes to provide multiple layers of support. We provide means-tested subsidies of up to 80% for patients requiring transport for centre-based services, dialysis or medical appointments at polyclinics and also at SOCs. Patients who need additional assistance may tap on cash payouts under ElderFund or other schemes, to defray thecosts of travel to and from medical appointments. So, we look at the overall framework and these are the schemes that sit outside that supplement and work with the existing framework.Financial concerns represent only some of the challenges that Singaporeans face when loved ones encounter disease or disability. Beyond being able to afford care, we want Singaporeans to feel supported in caring for each other as well.Ms Yip Pin Xiu has asked about our long-term plans for eldercare. Over the years, we have improved the accessibility of aged care services and also deepened the range of services and options available in the community and residential care settings.Last year, for instance, we launched the Care-giver Support Action Plan to support those caring for seniors on their care-giving journeys. Since then, we have been working with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and various community partners to roll out new initiatives.Some initiatives focus on care navigation and care-giver training. Care-givers can obtain information and access referral services at four new AIC Links touchpoints in Toa Payoh, Nee Soon, Pasir Ris and also Choa Chu Kang, which complement the eight existing touchpoints already existing in our heartlands. We have also worked with healthcare professionals to introduce a course on the \"ABCs of Care-giving\", with customised components to help care-givers with the different mobility needs of their loved ones.Within the eldercare landscape, there is a range of care-giving options. Many families engage foreign domestic workers (FDWs) to provide care and Ms Yip Pin Xiu asked if care-giver training initiatives will be extended to them as well.There are, indeed. merits to training FDWs and families can decide on how best equip them. We have initiatives to support those who choose formal training for their FDWs, such as the Eldercarer FDW Scheme which we have run since 2016. Training is done before placements in the households that they serve and includes both classroom theory and as well as on-the-job practical training in managing the day-to-day care-giving needs of an elderly person. Care-givers can tap on an annual $200 subsidy under the Care-givers' Training Grant to offset thecosts of training for their FDWs or other approved courses.Mr Christopher de Souza has asked about our measures to provide respite care and how effective they have been. Mr de Souza will be pleased to hear that we have respite care options at more than 20 eldercare centres and 40 nursing homes, where more than 3,700 so far have benefited.We have recently expanded the range of respite care options as well, starting with a respite care pilot in September 2019 for care-givers of cancer patients on home palliative care and a night respite care pilot in December 2019 for care-givers of persons with dementia, who experience behavioural and sleep issues at night. And sometimes, these difficulties cause the care-giver not to have his or her own rest. So, that option is available.We have also been helping care-givers access respite care at short notice. Care-givers under our Go Respite pilot launched in April last year were able to pre-enrol for these services and activate the respite care at short notice. To-date, 450 care-givers have been pre-enrolled.Beyond expenses for home and community-based services, care-giving expenses can take many forms and we recognise that.So, in October 2019, we launched the Home Care-giving Grant, which replaced the previous Foreign Domestic Worker Grant with an enhanced quantum of $200 per month. By providing cash support directly to care recipients with permanent disability, care-givers have greater flexibility as to how best to deploy these resources.We have since approved more than 4,900 applications for the Home Care-giving Grant, bringing the number of beneficiaries under the scheme to over 16,000.Allow me to share the story of one care-giver, to illustrate how our schemes address the care-givers' different types of needs.Mr Shahril lives with his wife, three children and a 79-year-old father, who is bed-bound after a stroke and heart attack. In October 2019, Mr Shahril needed a break from care-giving duties, as his helper had left the country for home leave. He shared this with the AIC Link staff at Changi General Hospital where his father was treated. Within two weeks, they enrolled Mr Shahril's father in AIC's Go Respite programme at the NTUC Health Nursing Home, across the road from their home, across the road from where they live, and he began his three-week stay there. This arrangement made it easier for Mr Shahril to continue to provide for his own family, with the assurance that, at the same time, his own father was being cared for during this period.At the same time, Mr Shahril also applied for the Home Care-giving Grant. Today, his family receives a monthly payout of $200, which they use for essential items, such as diapers, milk supplements and other disposables, as well as for his father's medical expenses. All in all, our schemes have given Mr Shahril the flexibility and the assurance to care for his father in the long term.I have shared how the Ministry is taking important steps to help address thecost of care, both financially and otherwise.These will support Singaporeans in seeking the necessary care. But at the same time, we must take bold steps to encourage healthier lifestyles. I think Members have heard that narrative from the speakers before me. This will delay the onset of disease and reap downstream savings for our healthcare system.Members will also be, nonetheless, familiar with our efforts on this front. Minister had previously described some of our efforts to promote healthy living under the war on diabetes initiative.Although we have made progress in encouraging Singaporeans to exercise more and eat healthier, our daily sugar intake, as some Members have pointed out, remains high. In particular, beverages contribute to more than half of the sugar intake.Both Mr Charles Chong and Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked for an update on our plans to control the consumption of such beverages. The same issues and questions have been raised by Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar in the House last week, while Mr Leon Perera also made suggestions what else we could do should these measures not prove to be effective.As a start, let me outline what we will do. As a start, we will implement two new regulatory measures for pre-packaged beverages: a nutrient-summary label and an advertising prohibition for beverages with high sugar and saturated fat content. So, two elements – sugar and saturated fat. We want to provide Singaporeans with the right information to make their own healthy choices and also, at the same time, encourage the manufacturers to reformulate their products and create healthier options, a point that Mr Perera also raised.Under this new regulatory framework, all pre-packaged beverages will be given a colour-coded nutrient-summary label, called the ‘\"Nutri-Grade\". With your permission, Mr Chairman, may I display an example of the label for Members?The Chairman: Yes, please. [A slide was shown to hon Members.]Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: On the screen, Members see an example of the label: Grade A, corresponding to the lowest sugar and saturated fat thresholds, is in dark green; while Grade D, corresponding to the highest sugar and saturated fat thresholds, is in red.This provides a quick, at-a-glance summary of the nutritional quality of the beverage, allowing consumers to compare across products at the point of purchase. Besides the grade, we will indicate the sugar level of the beverage as a percentage of the total volume. So, if you see 12% on the label, it represents 12% sugar of the total volume in that particular product.This provides Singaporeans with more information so that they can compare sugar levels across beverages within the same grade. With your permission, Mr Chairman, may I display a slide summarising the grading system?The Chairman: Yes, please. [A slide was shown to hon Members.]Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: Thank you, Sir. Pre-packaged beverages will be graded on a single set of nutrient thresholds, based on their sugar and saturated fat content. For example, beverages with more than 5% sugar content will be graded C, while beverages with more than 10% sugar content will be graded D. But beverages may subsequently be \"downgraded\", at the point in time, be downgraded to D, if they also contain a high amount of saturated fat.We encourage all manufacturers to label their products with the Nutri-Grade, but the label will only be mandatory for beverages in Grades C and D.The label is intended to facilitate Singaporeans' decisions when they go and purchase these products at the point of purchase. It will therefore not only be displayed on the front of product packaging, but also at points-of-sale the where customers do not have direct access to the product. For example, at e-commerce websites, vending machines, drink fountains, they will be displayed at the point-of-sale as well.In addition to labelling requirements, we will prohibit advertising for Grade D beverages on all media platforms, including traditional and new media platforms across all time belts. This will reduce the impact of advertising on consumer preferences and encourage manufacturers to reformulate.We will continue to allow advertising of Grade A to C beverages, as well as all brand advertising, as we want to encourage manufacturers to reformulate. The point is not to deprive Singaporeans of their favourite drinks, but to encourage manufacturers on their journey towards reformulation to create a wider and broader range of healthier options for Singaporeans to enjoy.The new regulations will be published at the end of 2020, coming into effect a year later.If manufacturers start today, they will have almost two years to reformulate their products in line with these regulations and avoid being in groups, Grade C or D where they have to compulsorily put on the label.The Health Promotion Board (HPB) will continue to support industry reformulation efforts through initiatives such as the Healthier Ingredient Development Scheme. And HPB will also launch a campaign to educate consumers on using the Nutri-Grade labels to guide purchase and consumption decisions.At the same time, we have heard strong calls from all quarters to also regulate – beyond just the pre-packaged – the freshly prepared beverages, such as herbal drinks and bubble teas. It is clear that they are a substantial and growing source of sugar intake for many Singaporeans. Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar, in particular, asked whether there are plans to extend our regulations to these drinks.Over the past few months, I have met representatives from the freshly prepared beverage sector to hear their views on how we can work with them as well to help consumers make that transition to healthier choices.Most understand the need to inform consumers about the nutritional quality of their products and they support our objective of reducing Singaporeans' overall sugar intake.After a careful review of the local landscape, we have decided to extend the labelling and advertising measures to freshly prepared beverages. As a start, these measures will apply only to the larger chains, which are more likely to have consistent recipes, as well as significant reach and impact locally. We will study the local landscape to determine the appropriate criteria for what comprises a \"large chain\".Other jurisdictions with mandatory labelling in F&B settings have, in their own countries, adopted thresholds of 10 to 20 outlets as being the definition of \"large chain\". But we will study this in our own context. We will take reference from what has been done in other countries, which means that small businesses with one or two stalls, such as those in hawker centres, would not be affected in the first instance. Nevertheless, we will monitor the impact of these measures, and may gradually seek to extend them to more establishments – along the vein of what Mr Perera had mentioned earlier.Concurrently, we encourage F&B outlets not considered \"large chains\" to voluntarily adopt these measures. We will continue to engage the industry in the coming months to finalise details of these measures, including how to implement them in acost-effective manner. More details will be shared when they are ready.All these initiatives are part of a longer term approach to reshape consumer behaviour towards healthier living, not just in the choices that they make, but in consumption.Some have suggested stronger measures, such as an excise duty or an outright ban. These will require further study, like those suggestions that Mr Perera raised. In the meantime, we will work closely with industry partners to support Singaporeans in making those healthier choices.Finally, as a complement to our regulations, we also want to encourage Singaporeans to just go for more plain water instead – zero calories and very healthy on the overall grading scale.So, on that front, we have been working with agencies like NEA, HDB, LTA and also NParks to increase the availability and accessibility of drinking water in the community.Water dispensers are available in 30 hawker centres – Members might be pleased to know – and are also easily found in parks across Singapore. By mid-2020, more water dispensers will be installed in the remaining 82 hawker centres.3.45 pmIn addition, 14 bus interchanges and terminals already have water coolers and we will work with LTA and public transport operators to install water points in bus and MRT stations where suitable. In mid-2020, HPB will launch a nation-wide campaign to promote plain water, as part of their nutrition literacy campaign. Whether you are exercising in our public parks, enjoying a meal at the hawker centres, taking a bus, about to take a bus, or in the MRT station, we encourage you to choose plain water and we will make the options available as much as possible.Mr Chairman, to conclude, the Government will continue to enhance the affordability of healthcare and expand support for care-giving. Policies such as the enhanced MediSave700 scheme will provide additional peace of mind for those with chronic illnesses.At the same time, we will pursue downstream savings for our system by encouraging healthier living and supporting Singaporeans in making healthier and we believe, therefore, wiser choices in what they consume. Better health for us all is a vision and responsibility we must all share. We urge Singaporeans to partner with us as we strive for a healthier Singapore not only in 2020 but beyond. Thank you, Mr Chairman.The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Amrin Amin): Beyond Healthcare to Health – going upstream and supporting healthy living. This is part of our ongoing transformation. To push this transformation, we will do three things which I will cover in my speech.First, better financial support. Second, better community partnerships. Third, better use of technology.On better financial support, we want Singaporeans, regardless of income or social background, to enjoy good health. We will do so in a fiscally sustainable, targeted and effective manner. I am happy to announce three initiatives.(a)\tFirst, full subsidies for nationally recommended childhood vaccinations and developmental screening.(b)\tSecond, subsidies for nationally recommended adult vaccinations.(c)\tThird, subsidies for nicotine replacement therapies for eligible participants at smoking cessation pilots.The effective dates for the vaccinations subsidies and child developmental screenings will be before the end of 2020 – exact dates will be announced later.Today, only recommended childhood vaccinations against infectious diseases with high outbreak potential such as measles and diphtheria receive full subsidies, and this is only available at polyclinics in the primary care setting. There are currently no subsidies for adult vaccinations and smoking cessation in the primary care setting.Full subsidies will be given to Singaporean children for all vaccinations recommended under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule or NCIS. These also include pneumococcal and HPV vaccines. Subsidies will be available at polyclinics and at CHAS GP clinics across Singapore.For Singaporean children up to the age of six, full subsidies for child developmental screenings will be extended from polyclinics to include CHAS GP clinics. We are doing this to ensure early detection and timely intervention for developmental delays for all Singaporean children. This measure is part of our ongoing efforts to ensure Singapore remains one of the best places to raise a child. So I urge parents to take advantage of the free vaccinations to give our children the best possible start.All eligible Singaporean adults will enjoy subsidies for vaccinations under the National Adult Immunisation Schedule or NAIS at polyclinics and CHAS GP clinics. The NAIS covers seven types of vaccines that protect against 11 diseases, including influenza and pneumococcal disease. NAIS recommends vaccination to two main groups of adults: The first group, persons with certain medical conditions such as diabetes, chronic heart diseases and chronic respiratory diseases; and the second group, seniors aged 65 and above.Subsidies will be means-tested. At polyclinics, eligible lower to middle income Singaporeans will get 75% subsidy. This corresponds to CHAS Blue and Orange cardholders at CHAS GP clinics. Other eligible Singaporeans will get 50% subsidy for the vaccinations. Pioneer Generation get an extra 50% subsidies and Merdeka Generation get an extra 25%, off the remaining co-payment amount.Let me illustrate. Now Singaporeans pay about $70 to $80 for PPSV23 pneumococcal vaccination at a polyclinic. Assuming you fall within the NAIS recommendations and qualify for the subsidies, you can expect to pay about $20 to $40, depending on means-test. Pioneer and Merdeka Generation gets additional subsidies.Singaporeans can continue to pay out-of-pocket amounts using MediSave. Singaporean adults will receive similar levels of means-tested subsidies for these vaccinations at CHAS GP clinics. We will share details when ready.To ensure vaccination subsidies are passed to eligible Singaporeans at CHAS GP clinics, MOH will introduce fee caps for NAIS and NCIS vaccinations done at CHAS GP clinics. It is quite tongue-twisting. MOH have also worked with vaccine manufacturers so CHAS GP clinics can get these vaccines at favourable prices. We are studying ways to help those who may have difficulties going to polyclinics and CHAS GPs, such as nursing home residents, to benefit from these subsidies.I mentioned earlier about providing the subsidies in a fiscally, sustainable and targeted, effective manner. Let me explain.First, the NAIS scopes the group of people whom the Expert Committee on Immunisation (ECI) has assessed to be more vulnerable to certain diseases and are therefore recommended for the vaccinations. So, targeted group based on need.Second, our aim is to reduce the number of people who fall ill from vaccine-preventable diseases. Singaporeans with chronic medical conditions are particularly vulnerable and fall sick more easily. If diseases can be prevented, we can gain system-wide savings in the long run. Essentially, this is what we are doing: keep out vaccine-preventable diseases through vaccinations, keep our people out of hospitals and keep them healthy.Mr Perera asked about the coverage of childhood vaccinations and how we can raise adult vaccination coverage in Singapore. Coverage for childhood vaccinations in Singapore is high, with most vaccinations exceeding 95% coverage in the past five years. This is due to efforts in health promotion, comprehensive childhood immunisation services and a robust school health service. All childcare centres and kindergartens require immunisation certifications for compulsory vaccinations under NCIS before enrolment. Parental inertia and lack of awareness are some of the reasons a small minority of children are not vaccinated.We have a two-pronged approach to increase children and adult vaccinations. The first is to make vaccinations affordable through subsidies and the second, public education. Public education has taken on renewed importance with misinformation from the anti-vaccination camps. We aim to increase vaccination coverage among adult Singaporeans to over 50% by 2025.Smokers will get more support to quit. Subsidies will be given for nicotine replacement therapy, if found suitable, in smoking cessation pilots. New smoking cessation models will be piloted in our public healthcare institutions such as hospitals, polyclinics and our national specialty centres.Singaporeans can benefit from intensive behavioural support, follow-up for up to a year and a 3-month nicotine replacement therapy, if found to be suitable.MOH is evaluating the pilot proposals. The pilots will target 10,000 smokers. We plan to start the pilots after Public Healthcare Institutions (PHIs) resume normal operations. This will depend on how the COVID-19 situation develops.Mr Charles Chong asked about existing measures to assist smokers to quit and their efficacy. Success rates for smoking cessation programmes in Singapore have ranged from 10% for telephone-based interventions to 20% for programmes that combine intensive counselling and pharmaco-therapy.Smoking is one of the biggest risk factors for poor health. Standardised packaging for tobacco products will start in July 2020. The minimum legal age for smoking will be raised to 21 next year. This will set a good momentum to drive down our smoking rates further.I shared in 2018 our stretched target of reducing our smoking rate to below 10% by 2020. Smoking rate in Singapore dropped to 10.6% in 2019. We will do our best to reach that stretched target.SPS Faishal asked about community health promotion activities. Indeed, cultural connections and understanding are strengths we are tapping on to mobilise the community towards a healthy cause.HPB's Jaga Kesihatan, Jaga Ummah (JKJU), which means take care of health, take care of community is one good example. JKJU started in August 2017. JKJU brought together MUIS, 28 mosques and Malay Activity Executive Committees. I am proud that they have reached out to over 35,000 Malay participants in 2019. This is important, involving the community and powering community institutions to take ownership and mobilise people to action. Truly a healthy development.Masjid Maarof organised piloxing, zumba, a skit on coping with dementia and urged congregants to give up a cigarette puff for a less calorie curry-puff (\"A Puff for a Puff\"). Masjid Al-Ansar offered circuit training and stretch-band exercises for seniors.We are stretching out to involve more partners and people. Our Regional Health Systems (RHSes) will partner JKJU to bring more quality programmes and deepen outreach. This will help greatly, it is a promising partnership. Because RHSes treat patients who are residents in the area, they know the local ailments and the common problems within the community. RHSes can help local partners like JKJU shape programmes, provide targeted interventions customised to local needs and offer medical expertise to raise awareness on community trending topics.I am also proud of the excellent work of Chinese and Indian community groups, 27 churches and 10 temples have worked hard to organise health promotion programmes. From health screenings, national step challenge roadshows to physical activity workouts.The Hindu Endowment Board, SINDA and Narpani and various places of worship partnered HPB and reached out to 5,000 people in 2019. The Hindu Endowment Board partnered National Healthcare Group to conduct health screenings for 1,500 people at Sri Perumal Temple in 2019.Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng asked about helping lower income Singaporeans stay healthy. HPB will pilot the \"Healthy Living Passport\" in mid-2020, beginning with five sites located in Boon Lay, Woodlands, Jurong Spring, Chua Chu Kang and MacPherson. We aim to reach at least 15,000 residents, about 5,000 families, over a three-year period.Healthy Living Passport seeks to improve health literacy and promote healthy lifestyles, customised to the needs of lower income residents. Lower income residents have specific concerns. They shared with us about working shifts, not having enough sleep and missing out on various community exercise programmes. They shared that healthier food such as vitamins, vegetables and low-calorie options tend to be more expensive. They raised stress as a concern and many, unfortunately, turned to smoking to unwind. We cannot brush these concerns aside. We should try to address them and hear them out.Healthy Living Passport is a modest effort, a sincere outreach to help our fellow Singaporeans lead healthy lives. Let us work together.We are still working out the exact parameters of Healthy Living Passport. Broadly, we are focusing on equipping participants with knowledge on shopping for budget, healthier ingredients and prepare healthier, tasty meals and promote physical activity, oral health and mental wellness.We are targeting to impart health tips to both parents and children in a fun and interactive way. Volunteers from HealthySG Buddies will encourage and support families to use this Healthy Living Passport and embark on a meaningful and fulfilling journey.Mr Charles Chong asked how MOH empowers and supports community care providers. We are committed to supporting community partners deliver better care to Singaporeans. One way is through funding support. An example is the Tote Board Community Healthcare Fund. This fund helps non-profit organisations pilot and scale innovative projects in preventive health and community care. The Tote Board Community Healthcare Fund has committed approximately $230 million since FY2009.The Tote Board Community Healthcare Fund funds the Wellness Support Package. This package supports nursing homes to upskill their manpower and implement senior-friendly activities such as table-top gardening and wheelchair taichi. Seniors enjoy these activities and homes reported improvement in seniors' mood, well-being and self-esteem. Twenty-five nursing homes have benefited from this.We are working more closely together. For instance, the RHS-HPB Integrated Volunteer Network and the Shared RHS-HPB Learning Hub. We recruit, train and deploy HPB Health Ambassadors and RHS volunteers together to promote health in the community.4.00 pmSince April 2019, volunteers in the Integrated Volunteer Network reached out to over 4,000 patients and residents in areas such as rehabilitation, health screening and quit-smoking programmes.In 2020, we aim to bring volunteers from all public hospitals on board the Integrated Volunteer Network.Advances in technology present opportunities to better tailor programmes and messages, and engage residents and deliver effective programmes to the right person, at the right time, at the right place.In the next few years, HPB will develop a Population Health Data Hub. This will be a national data hub containing information such as demographics, lifestyle and health information.The Hub will help us better understand Singaporeans’ lifestyle, behaviour and health. Interventions and nudges may be customised to individual’s needs and lifestyle, empowering behavioural change and driving health outcomes. This will help us to better address the causes of ill health early, and reduce incidence of chronic diseases.We are developing a virtual Health Booklet (vHB) that can send personal reminders, empowering individuals to better manage health. We expect to launch the virtual Health Booklet in end-2020.We are making good progress with HPB’s National Steps Challenge. Now in its fifth season, more than 850,000 participants have taken part. Participants have grown more active with more step counts and higher intensity physical activity.Mr Chong asked about screening rates. Screening rates have gone up from 45.1% in 2010 to 66.3% in 2019. Under Screen For Life, over 62,000 individuals aged 40 years and above have gone for cardiovascular screening at CHAS GP clinics. Of those with borderline and abnormal screening results, 84.4% have gone for medical follow-up as at 9 January 2020.We want more Singaporeans to attend screening and follow up on their screening to reduce risk of developing chronic diseases. This year, we will pilot tele-coaching for people found to be at risk of cardiovascular diseases through the Screen for Life programme. HPB's health coaches will reach out to selected individuals and invite participants to work on health goals through HPB or other programmes. Mr Chairman, in Malay, please.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.] Please allow me to put on record our highest appreciation to our frontline officers battling against COVID-19 and I would like to give a reminder on the importance of staying healthy through two poems.This first poem is an ode to our healthcare workers who are the heroes that we admire and respect. The second poem is a reminder to everyone to wash their hands with soap and to practise this good habit daily.Our primary objective is a healthy society. Regardless of income or background, we want all Singaporeans to enjoy good health and a good quality of life.I am happy to announce that MOH will introduce three new subsidies this year: first, full subsidies for nationally recommended childhood vaccinations and childhood developmental screening; second, subsidies for nationally recommended adult vaccinations; and third, subsidises for nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) for those selected at smoking cessation therapies.First, subsidies for childhood vaccinations. They will receive full subsidies. In other words, all vaccinations recommended under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS), including pneumococcal and HPV vaccines, will be provided for free to all Singaporean children. These subsidies will be available at all polyclinics and CHAS clinics in Singapore.Full subsidies will also be provided for childhood developmental screenings for Singaporean children aged six and below, at all polyclinics and CHAS clinics. Early detection and recovery will result in better outcomes.To quote a Malay proverb – bend a bamboo while it is still a bamboo shoot. We want our children to start their lives healthy. This is an on-going effort to ensure Singapore remains one of the best places to raise children and have a family.Second, subsidies for vaccinations recommended for adults. This subsidy will be given for vaccinations recommended under the National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS) for some groups of adult Singaporeans. First, seniors aged 65 and above; and second, those with chronic medical conditions.NAIS covers seven types of vaccines that protect against 11 diseases, including influenza and pneumococcal disease. The subsidies will be means-tested. At polyclinics, lower to middle income Singaporeans will get a 75% subsidy. In general, these are the CHAS Blue and Orange cardholders. Other Singaporeans will get a 50% subsidy. The Pioneer Generation receives an additional 50% subsidy while the Merdeka Generation receives an additional 25% off the remaining co-payment amount.I urge all Singaporeans, especially parents and seniors, to take advantage of this subsidy. Prevention is better than cure.Singaporeans can continue to pay out-of-pocket amounts using Medisave. For instance, the pneumococcal vaccination (PPSV23) nowcosts about $70 to $80 at polyclinics for seniors. With the subsidies, Singaporean seniors pay only about $20 to $40. It is even lesser for the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation. Singaporean adults will receive similar subsidies if they go to CHAS clinics. We will share more details next time.Third, subsidies for nicotine replacement therapies for those undergoing smoking cessation therapies. One in four Malay Singaporeans are smokers. We will commence the smoking cessation pilot programme in public healthcare institutions after the COVID-19 situation subsides and normal operations resume.This programme will target 10,000 smokers and will offer counselling, nicotine replacement therapy if suitable and follow-up consultations up to a year. Do not wait until it is too late. Do not wait until you fall ill to quit smoking. We have done so much together. These include the \"Kita Dah Cukup Manis\" campaign to reduce sugar consumption, the \"Puff for a Puff\" programme to quit smoking, and the \"Get Fit for Haj/Umrah\" and \"Move and Be Happy\" programmes to invite everyone to be more active.I thank the community for their strong support. I am heartened and confident that there is a noticeable change. I have experienced it myself. When I was out for Hari Raya visits, I was often served plain water and reminded that \"We are already sweet enough, aren't we?\" Yes, definitely sweet enough.Let us enhance our efforts together to stay healthy and have a sweeter life.(In English): Mr Chairman, truly, health is wealth. We are reminded of how quickly things can change and how fragile life is with COVID-19. Let us support one another to stay healthy.The Chairman: Clarifications. Dr Chia Shi-Lu.Dr Chia Shi-Lu: Thank you, Chairman. I just have two clarifications for Senior Minister of State Lam and two for Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong.For Senior Minister of State Lam, besides building new polyclinics, are there any plans to redevelop or refresh existing polyclinics, given that many of the polyclinics are growing long in the tooth.Secondly, I asked the question whether there were any enhancements to the PHPC system. I may have missed his answer but I was wondering whether there are any plans to improve the system or to strengthen the system.For Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong, I think I am very heartened to hear about this new Nutri-Grade labeling system. But I saw on the slide that the label was \"subject to change\". I was just wondering whether Ministry has tried it out or done some test-bedding of these labels to see how effective they are, how clear they are.And my second question is, I note that he said that 70% of these pre-packaged drinks would be classified as C or D. I was wondering of that percentage, how many are actually under D.Finally, does this information also extend to those dispensed drinks, at soda fountains or at drink machines?Dr Lam Pin Min: I would like to thank Dr Chia for those supplementary questions. With regard to polyclinics' development, in addition to those that we have announced for new developments, which is up to 32 polyclinics by 2030, we do have existing polyclinics that are being redeveloped, one of it was Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic which was redeveloped some time back. And moving forward, we are also going to redevelop Toa Payoh Polyclinic. Of course, we will review and look at the requirements on the ground and for those polyclinics that can be redeveloped to cater to the increased capacity, we will do so.As for PHPC, currently, we do not have plans to enhance it. We feel that with the current 800 to 900 PHPC clinics on the ground, in fact, it is serving its purpose well but having said that, I think we will see how the COVID-19 situation evolves. If need be, we can enhance it as and when necessary.Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: On Dr Chia's two questions, the Nutri-Grade label, yes, it is subject to change as we look at the design. But he will be heartened to note that we have already looked at it very closely. We had about 12 focus group discussions and also studied with the food science people, people who looked at it from a behaviourial perspective. In fact, after this we will be putting up on our website the report of the findings that we have gathered from these focus group discussions.And so, generally, the label is designed, having in mind simplicity, giving fullest of information in terms of the choice, but also easy to recognise so that those who are not so conversant, the elderly, may be able to distinguish them.The Member's second point about the 70%, the figures approximately are 70% will fall into C and D. And of that, about 25, 26% will be D. Looking at these numbers, you can see why we have said earlier that there is a strong desire for us to encourage the market to reformulate on their own. Because much as you design the Grading system, what we also want to ensure – and we do not ban the items – so what we want to ensure is that the market, on its own, corrects it, and – I think, it is a point that Mr Perera made – manufacturers do appreciate that the market is looking out for healthier options. This is one of the ways, along with the advertising ban, that we want to push market in a particular direction.On the Member's final point about the soda fountains, yes, I mentioned that to the extent that we are not able to have the consumers review the product grading – the Nutri-Grade – before it is actually purchased, then at the point of sale, in other words, perhaps at the cashier or at the place where the orders are taken, that summary label will also be available.The Chairman: Dr Lily Neo.Dr Lily Neo: Thank you, Mr Chairman. May I ask the Minister whether there is a possibility of more widespread community spread of COVID-19? And will MOH be able to cope with this? And whether does our Government have more specific measures in place to cope with this scenario?Mr Gan Kim Yong: Mr Chairman, I thank Dr Lily Neo for this very important question. As I mentioned in my speech, we do expect to see more cases coming in, given the emerging cases all around the world. Many countries are beginning to see confirmed cases of COVID-19. In quite a number of countries, there are already significant community spread within the country and, therefore, there is a high risk of exportation of these cases to Singapore. We have raised precautionary measures: as you have seen, in recent days. We have introduced new travel advisories as well restrictions and we have also introduced a swab practices for those passengers or travellers who are showing signs of being unwell. These will help us to prevent or to minimise the number of imported cases.But some of these cases may still be imported because it is not possible to stop every case. Many of them may enter without symptoms because it is still within the incubation period. They may begin to fall sick while they are in Singapore. And there may also be Singaporeans returning from these areas – they may also develop symptoms, after arrival in Singapore.Therefore, we do expect to see a significantly higher number of cases in time to come. With a higher number of cases in Singapore, the risk of community spread will also increase. Therefore, it is important for us to re-emphasise the need for us to pay attention to public health and personal hygiene.That is why I mentioned that the SG Clean campaign is very important. Through this campaign, we hope to build a strong foundation of public health, raise the standard of public health – whether it is in our food outlets, in our public areas, in our public toilets – and at the same time, also entrench a higher standard of personal hygiene, and look at how we can improve some of the social practices like common servicing spoons and chopsticks in our restaurants.4.15 pmThese will go a long way in helping us to minimise and reduce the risk of widespread community transmission.As of today, we still do not have evidence of widespread transmission in our community here, but we cannot allow our guard to come down. We have to continue to be mindful and to exercise and practise high levels of personal hygiene.The Chairman: Ms Irene Quay.Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching: Thank you, Chairman. Senior Minister of State Lam shared about this national antimicrobial surveillance report. I just wanted to ask if the results are ready and how are we faring in terms of our antibiotic utilisation in the community? What are our national targets and what are we doing about it?Dr Lam Pin Min: I would like to thank Ms Irene Quay for the supplementary questions. As I have mentioned, the first joint report of antimicrobial utilisation and resistance in Singapore will be published later this year. So, I would not be able to let Ms Irene Quay know what the initial results are. Please be patient. The report will be released for public viewing.The Chairman: Ms Joan Pereira.Ms Joan Pereira: I have got two clarifications for Senior Minister of State Amy Khor. Earlier, she mentioned the Community Care Nursing Leadership Programme, or CCNLP. May I know how this complements the Community Nursing Scholarship that was earlier announced in 2017 to develop the pipeline of nursing leaders in the community?The second clarification is on assisted living. Though the Senior Minister of State shared that the Government is rolling out assisted living flats to expand housing options for seniors, I still wonder whether there will be enough assisted living flats for all seniors, especially with an ageing population.Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan: With regard to the Member's first question about the Community Nursing Scholarship and how this relates to the Community Care Nursing Leadership Programme. The Community Nursing Scholarship is for fresh school leavers, whether they are \"A\" Level or existing nursing students. So, they are fresh. What we are doing is trying to inject fresh talent into the community care sector – those with leadership potential and who have a passion to serve in the community care sector. As the Member has said, that started in 2017. Between 2017 and 2019, we have got 17 of these scholars. Although, of course, the class sizes in the Polytechnics are bigger, but those under this scholarship programme, there are 17 now.For the Community Care Nursing Leadership Programme, this is a talent development programme. It is leadership development for the existing cohorts who are already registered nurses. They do not have to be in the community care sector. So, any registered nurse with good, strong clinical skills as well as nursing experience, and who are interested to join the sector, could apply for this. They will have an individual development plan for them to become leaders, take leadership positions in the sector.Regarding assisted living, the Member's question was whether there will be enough. Firstly, let me say that there is already a range of housing options for seniors. One of them, of course, would be 2-room flexi flats. They can also choose to stay in their existing flat and get the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) and the Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE), and then, get services like home care, day care and so on, and with the support of family. Or they can sell and use the housing grant of up to $30,000, the Proximity Housing Grant, to stay near their children or stay with their children.What we have done is work with MND, and also based on feedback to look at another housing option for seniors – assisted living, which is not just the hardware, the physical space, but is actually the flat twinned with a basic service package that will be sold to the seniors. It is really to meet different preferences, needs as well as lifestyle aspirations. This might be useful for a group of seniors who want to be independent, live independently, may not have very strong family support, who feel that as they get more frail, they will need more services. In addition, they want to prevent themselves from being socially isolated, they want to have some kind of communal living and yet have some privacy. So, that is what this assisted living housing form is for.We will monitor the demand for this. This is a pilot. We will monitor the demand and decide if we will build more of this housing form. As I have said, we are also looking at a pilot in the private housing market.The Chairman: Ms Anthea Ong.Ms Anthea Ong: Thank you, Chairman. I first want to thank Senior Minister of State Amy Khor for announcing to the House that there will be a whole-of-Government and multi-Ministry effort to address mental health as a national priority. It is very sweet, D grade-worthy news, I think. But I hope that it is not just the elderly and the youths that we are looking at, because the sandwiched ones are the very ones who are playing a big role in the mental well-being of our youths, and they are also the care-givers of our elderly.So, if the Senior Minister of State will indulge me, I have four clarifications and one comment, from the four cuts.I understand the Ministry is not intending to bring to parity the limits for MediSave and MediShield in terms of physical and mental health conditions, which, to me, would be the loudest anti-stigma signal, with that parity. Can I urge MOH to conduct its own public consultation or studies to examine the many affordability issues that were raised in our own rudimentary public study that I shared both in the Budget debate speech and earlier.I know because I think we all understand that the treatment process for mental health conditions is a lot —The Chairman: Ms Anthea Ong, given the number of clarifications we have, could you keep it to just clarifications, please?Ms Anthea Ong: Sure. Thank you. So, a lot more nuanced and protracted, so there is acost implication.The Senior Minister of State also confirmed that Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is now included in Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP), but I just checked the MOH website and it is still not there. Earlier, Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong also only listed four mental health conditions that are covered but not OCD. So, can Senior Minister of State Khor please confirm that.I asked the Ministry about the plans to improve the waiting times, which is right now 27 to 28 days to see psychiatrists and psychologists. Can I please ask Ms Amy Khor to respond to this ask?The next ask that I also filed in my cut, which has not been responded to, is – I asked the Ministry to consider MediSave to be used for community organisations that are providing mental healthcare services. Can I please have a response to that?Last but not least, Senior Minister of State Khor assured that the Ministry will look at specific needs of the differently-abled in public mental healthcare. Can the Senior Minister of State also assure that the LGBTQ+ community, that their specific needs will also be looked at, as I had outlined in the dedicated cut on this.Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan: I think it is more like six follow-up questions, not four. I will try and answer them.First of all, this thing about parity between MediSave and MediShield Life. As I have tried to explain, when we set the withdrawal limits for MediSave or MediShield – say, inpatient, for the different types of treatment, different types of conditions, not just mental health but other conditions, we look at the bill sizes.To give you an example, in 2018, the average daily bill size for inpatient psychiatric treatment at IMH is $90. But for acute hospital, the average bill size, taking out thecost of surgery procedures, is $480. So, if you talk about parity, we are talking about parity in terms of making sure that the withdrawal limits will cover a majority of thecost of the treatment for subsidised patients. Therefore, for MediSave daily withdrawal limit, it is $150 for psychiatric treatment.And as I have said earlier, for inpatient MediSave withdrawal limit, less than one in 10 actually exceed their $5,000 yearly withdrawal limit and less than three in 10 exceed their daily limit. So, that is what the parity is. It is not the absolute amount but what is the bill size.I assure the Member that we will and we have always continued to monitor to make sure that the withdrawal limits are adequate, to make access to healthcare affordable to our subsidised patients. And, as I have said for MediShield Life, the MediShield Life Council is reviewing the MediShield Life limits for the different conditions. So, the same thing with MediSave withdrawal for outpatient treatment.The next question is on OCD. The word is not there. It is under \"Anxiety disorder\". So, if a doctor says under anxiety, it is OCD, it is covered. Dr Chia Shi-Lu is nodding his head. So, it is covered. The word is not there. I only listed a few, because I did not have enough time.For wait time, as in for access to many other treatments, we are always mindful of the wait time. What we are doing to try and reduce the wait time is that for the hospitals and polyclinics, they are trying to see how they can review their work processes to optimise the appointment slots. For instance, you try to tighten the triaging, so, they call the patient before the appointment, to try and optimise these slots.We are also looking at tiering of services to provide the appropriate level of care, because not everything has to go to the specialists. When it is possible to get care in the community or in primary care sector, then we will refer them to the primary care sector or community care sector.For the Member's information, as I have said over the years, we have tried to increase access to treatment and we have now got about 210 GPs who are trained to provide mental healthcare. If they do not need to go to a specialist, they can be treated or cared for in the primary care sector. And, actually, there is no wait time, and they still can get a subsidy, through CHAS as well as through CDMP.If they access care through the community intervention teams, the first referral is within two weeks – 14 days – a lot shorter.That is what we are trying to do. And then, only for the more complex cases, they go to the specialist – to try and shorten the wait time.Besides that, if urgent medical mental health assistance is needed or they need to see the doctor immediately, they can contact IMH through the 24-hour Mental Health Helpline or show up at the IMH 24-hour Emergency Services. Having said that, we are working on how we can reduce the wait time. So, I hope that answers the Member's question.Regarding mental health of the LGBT community, as I have said earlier, healthcare providers who are caring for all persons with mental health conditions, are trained and they are supposed to provide these patients with empathy, sensitivity and due consideration to their specific care needs as well as risk factors. What we have done is to adopt a team-based approach to healthcare and ensure that different perspectives are considered. If need be, they can get the experts to come in to provide holistic care.In addition to that, let me say that in 2017, the Institute of Mental Health set up the Gender Care Clinic. This clinic provides counselling and psychiatric treatment for persons experiencing emotional difficulties pertaining to gender identity, including the people who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria. And approximately 50% of these patients have a co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis. Majority of them will have anxiety and depressive disorders, and they are actually treated there. So, there are various avenues that we help this group of people.4.30 pmI think I have answered all the queries. Oh, one more. If the community care provider is working together, say, with the GP or with the polyclinic and they are referred to them, then I think they can access MediSave. But, of course, the community care provider must be qualified.The Chairman: Mr Melvin Yong.Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye: Sir, my first question is for Senior Minister of State Amy. Besides raising the retirement and re-employment age ahead of schedule, what else is MOH planning to do to support older healthcare workers and maximise their employment at the workplace?My second question is for Senior Minister of State Lam. He announced the introduction of the Integrated Youth Service in Woodlands with Care Corner. Could the Senior Minister of State share more details about what services are provided under this Integrated Youth Service?Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan: The public healthcare institutions welcome older workers or mid-careerists to work in the public healthcare sector.For us, manpower is a perennial challenge. So, we are doing everything we can to attract as well as to retain our mid-careerists and to re-employ older workers. Some of the things that we have done is firstly, to design age-friendly workplaces as well as put in place age-friendly employment measures. So, redesigning the job roles, flexible work arrangements, part-time, for instance. The nurses now have access to part-time work, more flexible work arrangements, as well as even preparing, what we call, pre-retirement preparatory training to prepare them to be re-employed again or to encourage them to be re-employed again.And then, in the community care sector, we are also working to redesign jobs so that they can be broken up and seniors or older workers can do part-time work. A very good example is NTUC Health. They break up care roles so that seniors could be escorts to bring the patients to the senior care centre or care for them through active ageing programmes in a care centre.Another one would be to reduce the manual burden or workload on the senior workers. So, patient uplifters, transfer aids and so on, which are really helpful to our healthcare workers, including nurses. Lastly, even within the healthcare institutions, we have got jobs that help to take some of the workload, say, from the nurses so that nurses can focus more on their clinical work, so \"Basic Care Assistants\", for instance. And we have got 100-odd of them now and more than half are actually above 50.Dr Lam Pin Min: I would like to share Mr Melvin Yong that the new Integrated Youth Service (IYS) has been developed to provide holistic support for social and mental health services to at-risk youths. There are basically four services that IYS provide. First, which is to outreach for prevention which is to increase awareness and encourage help-seeking behaviours. This is done through activities like roadshows, talks and workshops on mental health topics.The second service they provide is to identify needs and to provide a one-stop service for care coordination.The third service will be for peer facilitation and mentoring. So, at IYS, we will look for model youths who will provide that kind of a role model for these youths at-risk as well as to look for youth volunteers who can actually better engaged these youth during activities like roadshows and outreach programme.And the last service that IYS provides is to provide emotional support and monitoring. It can be done in the form of group sessions to improve resilience as well as coping skills.The Chairman: Ms Tin Pei Ling.Ms Tin Pei Ling: Thank you. I have two questions. Firstly, I would like to ask whether the Ministry will consider setting up a matching fund to boost the funds raised by community organisations, including grassroots with the aim of supporting seniors who need help with their healthcare financing. I declare my interest because in MacPherson, we have a MacPherson Care Fund since 2012. So, obviously, such a fun will help us stretch that dollar to help more seniors.The second question is about bone health. I fully agree with this. The statistics about the risk of hip fractures to the health of seniors were very alarming. I would like to ask: what is the Ministry doing more upstream, perhaps what HPB is doing to help encourage Singaporeans to take care of their bone health earlier, perhaps even targeting women who are at higher risk because they may have given birth to children, prolonged nursing and so on? I think these are all factors that may contribute to calcium loss.Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: I will address Ms Tin's first point. On the matching fund, MOH has set up the Community Silver Trust in 2012. That is to encourage donations and also additional resources to providers in the intermediate and the long-term care (ILTC) health space. And that is done by providing a matching grant, every dollar for every dollar, for eligible ILTC providers.The Trust's matching grant supports providers in building capabilities, enhancing the quality of care. The matching grant also frees up charity dollars, which organisations can then channel towards defraying thecosts of healthcare for their seniors.Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan: Let me say personally that I also felt that many people may not realise they only have a very limited amount of time to build up bone health. And for women, I am told is actually even before 30 years old. You will maximise your bone health and after that, either you try and keep it or you are going to lose it. And from menopause onwards, it is a steep decline if you do not do anything.For seniors, we have been working with seniors on bone health. But as the Member has rightly pointed out, what we want to do now is to go upstream. We are not the first. In the US, they provide a guide to the parents about how to build up strong bones in their kids from young. So, what we are doing is to work with HPB and Osteoporosis Society to trial this, to pilot this in 10 schools. We want to try and do it in a fun way. So, they are developing the curriculum as well as putting up videos to get students to understand and have a healthy lifestyle, good nutrition as well as exercise and so on.The Member is right that one of the things is, under our Women Health Advisory Committee, we are also looking at how we can reach out to get more to understand that if they do not do this, fracture is really a very debilitating condition.Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: I would also like to let Ms Tin know that the Trust is made up initially of a $1 billion injection by the Government. And Ms Tin might remember that in 2018, it was topped up by another $300 million. Since the inception of the Trust, it has matched up to $700 million in terms of donations from the eligible organisations.The Chairman: Would Dr Chia like to withdraw his amendment?Dr Chia Shi-Lu: Chairman, I wish to thank all Members who have taken part in this debate and, of course, Minister Gan, Senior Ministers of State Amy Khor and Dr Lam Pin Min and Mr Edwin Tong and also Senior Parliamentary Secretary Amrin Amin, together with all the staff at MOH for their replies and the work they have put in for the healthcare system for the benefit of all Singaporeans. On this note, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $11,696,866,200 for Head O ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $1,713,083,800 for Head O ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.The Chairman: I wonder whether we are suitably inspired by MOH to skip tea-break, eat less and be healthier? So, I will pose the question to you. The question is, we are inspired by MOH to skip tea-break, eat less, be healthier and happier. As many as are that opinion say aye. To the contrary say no.Hon Members: No!The Chairman: I think the noes have it, the noes have it. I propose to take a break now.Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the House.Mr Speaker: Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 5.00 pm. Order. Order.Sitting accordingly suspendedat 4.40 pm until 5.00 pm.Sitting resumed at 5.00 pm[Mr Speaker in the Chair]"

        "Content": "Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [18 February 2020] [1st Allotted Day],\"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021.\" ‒ [Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance].Question again proposed.12.33 pmMr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah): Mr Speaker, Sir. There is never a dull moment for this tiny island. The COVID-19 outbreak is the latest uncertainty to be added to our list of challenges the country faces – even as we grapple with growing stresses in the global trading system, the impending shake-up in the international tax regime, the increasingly difficult geopolitical dynamics that we have to navigate through – to name a few.These are all working against our operating proposition, where, as a small and open state, we thrive on a rules-based multilateral system and where each has its opportunities and livelihood based on competitive advantages.In the midst of navigating these daunting external developments, we have also our domestic challenges to content with – such as the ageing demographics, peaking of the local labour workforce in the decade ahead, the friction that we saw in jobs matching and so on.At times like this, it may come across as the world is collapsing upon us. But then, this is Singapore. We are no stranger to crisis. We have been hit by external shocks many times in our history. We have had to deal with many existential threats and challenges. Some, we have overcome and some are still out there, like rising sea levels. And very often, we turned the solutions to our domestic challenges into opportunities and possibilities – like the water story, or how we build physical and non-physical connectivity with the world to make up for our lack of size and hinterland.The Singapore's exceptionalism story has always been about constantly in the mode of preparing and readying for the next crisis to come even as we hope that things can be smooth sailing. And when the crisis does hit us, we respond decisively, purposefully and with ample fire power to make a difference. Thereafter, regroup, build up again and get ready for the next crisis.So, here we are again. Let me start with the fiscal management of the Government, which epitomises this psyche of preparing and readying for a crisis. Thanks to disciplined and prudent financial management as well as the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC), the surpluses accumulated in this term of Government, allow us to mount a massive and robust response to the current situation, yet allowing us to still press on with our longer term agenda.Without NIRC, three out of the last four fiscal years would have ended in deficit positions. So, we are already spending more than what we have collected from taxes. The call to spend more, the need to spend more is expected to keep rising. The calls were even louder in Budget 2018, where there was a bigger that projected surplus of $10.9 billion for FY2017 due to a one-off contribution from MAS and stamp duties collections.It is understandable for all of us here, in this chamber, to push for more spending and subsidies in areas that we feel strongly about. I do that a lot here. The Finance Minister would then have the unenviable task of allocating the next dollar based on our priorities; and also importantly, based on how these spending commitments can be sustainably funded.It is always tempting to be nice and popular – spend more today and worry about tomorrow later. Fortunately, this is not the case for Singapore's Ministry of Finance.I remember at last year's Budget Statement speech, the Finance Minister said this: \"Our fiscal discipline and prudence gave us the resources to respond decisively to unexpected challenges, such as the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. We must not take this for granted.\"These words said last year may sound like the Finance Minister knew what was to come in 2020. But we know that the good old adage of \"Saving for Rainy Days\" has never failed Singapore. It is our most valuable 20-20 foresight and so aptly shows up in Budget 2020.A case in point here is how we used the savings for rainy days to come up with this $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package to deal with the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak.Indeed, the first wave impact to the affected businesses such as tourism, aviation and retail have been sharp and severe. Some hotels have almost immediately seen 50% drop in occupancy as travellers deferred their trips and many international conferences and meetings were cancelled. Air travel has dropped significantly, especially for routes to the affected areas. Cinemas, restaurants, taxis have all seen lower patronage. Even neighbourhood coffeeshops' businesses are affected as more eat at home and do less outings.The Stabilisation and Support Package has rightly focused on tackling two situations. Firstly, the weaker cash flow position of businesses due to sudden drop in revenue; secondly and actually more importantly, to focus on saving jobs as the sudden drop in businesses have also resulted in excess labour.The announced measures of rental waivers, rebates, temporary bridging loans, point-to-to point support package for taxis and private hire car drivers are practical and helpful relief measures to businesses and to Singaporeans.I am glad that Government has also introduced the Jobs Support Scheme to provide wage support to companies. It not only helps companies with their cash flow situations but also incentivise employers to hold on their workers. Coupled with the enhanced upskilling measures that were also announced, the message to employers is to tap on these assistance schemes to send workers for training and skills upgrade during this lull period and be ready to seize opportunities again when the recovery comes.I would like to make a technical suggestion here to the Finance Minister. The qualifying period for the Job Support Scheme is for salary paid during the months from October 2019 to December 2019. And hence, there is this possibility that employers who enjoy this cash grant could still lay off the workers in the months later. While I believe most employers will be grateful and understand the Government's good intention, MOF could eliminate this possibility by adding another condition; which is that that the wage support will only be valid for those workers who remain in employment from January to July 2020.Sir, I welcome the update by the Finance Minister on timing of the GST rate increase and that it will not happened in 2021. The $6 billion Assurance Package does help to address the concerns of Singaporeans on the GST increase.The COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting sudden surge in demand for its related medical services further underscored the critical need to allocate sufficient funding for healthcare services and that we not only need to have the right capacity but also the deep specialisation and expertise to deal with any public health threat of this scale.As our population ages, the recurring annualcosts to provide healthcare services will surely rise. And our expectations for higher subsidies, better quality healthcare and better accessibility will also keep rising over time.For example, at my Constituency, we are building a new 12-storey polyclinic which comes at acost of more than $100 million and thereafter, millions of dollars in recurringcosts to run the centre. We are also looking at sites within our estates to build more senior day-care centres that come with medical facilities to handle long-term chronic illness. I understand thecosts of each such centre is minimally $1 million and again, thecostly recurring expenses.While I dislike seeing GST rate increase, I do understand that the Finance Minister would need additional funding to help pay for these new expenditures as well as other increased spending in social areas in education, in security and so on.I am convinced that our system of GST that stapled it with a massive and almost permanent GST offset package does mitigate its impact on lower and middle households and re-tilt it from a regressive to a progressive tax system.GST taxes on everyone who consume. But those who spend more especially on more expensive items will contribute more GST. These tend to be from the wealthier or the higher income group. Even foreigners who are here for work, businesses or leisure also contribute to our GST coffer when they spend in Singapore. Just like if I travel to Japan, I would also have to pay the 10% consumption tax for my spending there and in effect, directly helping to fund Japan's budget deficit. Here, it would be useful if the Finance Minister can share on the proportion of GST collected that is being contributed by the higher income groups and foreigners.The Assurance Package that will come into effect when the GST rate increase kicks in after 2021 is specifically targeted at helping the lower and middle income Singaporean households and seniors. Under the Package, every adult Singaporean will receive a cash payout of $700 to $1,600 over five years. The majority of Singaporeans will receive offsets to cover at least five years' worth of additional GST expenses incurred.In other words, to the majority of Singaporeans, the effect of the GST increase will be further pushed back by another five years when the new increase kicks in because of the Assurance Package.Mr Speaker, Sir, I am heartened that in the midst of a long list of agenda items in this year's Budget, the Finance Minister has not forgotten on a group Singaporeans who are increasingly worried about their job security and employability. These are workers in their 40s and 50s. I would like to speak for them today. In Mandarin, please.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Mr Speaker, I am heartened that Finance Minister has pointed out in the Budget speech that in the next bound of SkillsFuture, there will be a dedicated focus on mid-career workers, those in the 40s and 50s.Indeed, many of the workers in the 40s and 50s, especially the Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs), are very worried about losing their jobs and they feel a great sense of insecurity.Those who unfortunately lose their jobs at this age face an uphill task to find another job that commensurate with their work experience and their expectations, even though they may be prepared to lower their expectations by a few notches.I have met many such job seekers at my Meet-the-People session. I can fully understand what they are going through. They are often under tremendous pressure to find a new job quickly and the entire family is also impacted as these job seekers are often also the sole or main breadwinner.As what the Deputy Prime Minister has related in the Budget speech, for people in their 40s and 50s, when they started work, it was normal to stay with one job, in one or two companies, for life. They lived through the period when Singapore’s economy experienced high growth, and technology was not changing very fast as to have a major impact on the workplace. So overall, their jobs were stable.But, now, economic growth is a lot slower and the workplace is undergoing major changes at a rapid pace. This has a direct impact on job market stability.Of course, as our economy transforms, new jobs are created while old jobs disappear and never return.The issue is that these new positions are often not filled by this age group of job seekers. Reasons often cited are that there is mismatch in skills or expectations from both job seekers and hirers.There are also situations where, even after the training and skills upgrade, employers are still not willing to take on these workers as they have younger ones to choose from.This trend is particularly worrying, especially when we are now raising the retirement and re-employment age. We do not want these workers who are still in their prime to prematurely experience unemployment and even stay as long-term unemployed. This would be a high socialcost to the individual, their families and the society. The economy will also be deprived of a major source of human resource and talents.The situation calls for direct interventions from the Government, including more upstream and pre-emptive actions, including stronger retrenchment and job placement support.The Government saw this problem coming some years ago and that is why we have packages such as the Adapt and Grow and the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP).The best way to do this is to help workers stay employable when they still have a job and for them to have the option to move to new jobs and new roles if need be. We need to reduce difficulties in job transition and enhance their capabilities to better match jobs so that job seekers can be re-employed faster.Hence, I welcome this new SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package which aims to do that. Under this initiative, the Government aims to double the annual job placement of local workers in their 40s and 50s to around 5,500.The capacity of our existing reskilling programmes will also be stepped up, such as the PCP, career transition programme and sector-specific programmes.I would urge the agencies that run these programmes to also focus more on helping job seekers to overcome psychological barriers and make mental adjustments.On the other hand, we know that there are indeed biases on the part of employers, including ageism when hiring.Hence, the most significant announcement in this package is that the Government is providing hiring incentive to employers who hire local job seekers aged 40 and above through the reskilling programme. For each eligible worker, the employer will receive 20% salary support for six months, capped at $6,000.This salary support is equivalent to a negative workers levy and I hope that it will move more employers to consider these experienced workers. Of course, we need employers to collaborate and give these job seekers a chance.The Deputy Prime Minister also announced that the Government would review the support package for talent hiring and retention to maximise its impact.To further encourage lifelong learning, the Minister has also announced a special SkillsFuture top-up of $500 to every Singaporean aged 40 to 60, so that this group of Singaporeans will get $1,000 SkillsFuture Credit in total.The Finance GPC has raised its concerns and views with the Minister for Finance in our Budget engagement and I thank him for hearing us out with this substantial upgrade in package to help our workers in their 40s and 50s, so that they can benefit and have peace of mind.(In English): Mr Speaker, in his Budget speech, Deputy Prime Minister Heng also called on Singaporeans to work together in partnership to build the future of our choice.It is in difficult times like this that we need to rally the spirit of SG Together. At our communities, we have seen spontaneous acts by fellow residents, such as coming together to bottle hand sanitisers and placing them in lifts for residents to use, volunteering at masks distribution centres to distribute masks at RC centres or expressing gratitude and cheering on our frontline healthcare workers.Social organisations, artists, sports persons and many others have also organised various efforts to help vulnerable groups. We have also seen commercial organisations like banks, insurance companies, MNCs coming up with relief packages to help their clients tide over the difficult period.Budget 2020 represents a very strong set of decisive actions by the Government to deal with the COVID-19 situation. But these counter-crisis efforts can be even more effective or powerful if more stakeholders can also facilitate and reinforce the relief measures introduced by the Government. For example, landlords who enjoy the new 15% property tax rebates should quickly pass this on to their tenants in the form of reduced rentals or do even more.I have just gotten confirmation from the coffee shop operator at my CC who promised me that he will completely pass on half a month's rental waiver to the self-employed stallholders who are impacted by the crisis as well and I would like to urge other coffee shop operators to do the same, especially those in HDB estates.Companies that are not adversely affected by the crisis could consider using the wage support received from the Jobs Support Scheme meaningfully, for example, to invest in their employees' skills upgrade or on their welfare or flow some of it to their clients that may be impacted by the crisis.Each of us and our businesses can do our part, big or small, each in our own way, to help out fellow businesses that are affected. All these efforts add up and go a long way in helping Singapore ride out this difficult period and emerge even stronger. Sir, I support the Budget.12.52 pmMs Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast): Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing me to participate in the Budget debate. Let me start by sharing a story.A young resident came to my Meet-the-People Session (MPS) some years ago to ask for financial assistance to pay for his ITE school fees. I told him that we would assist him, but I asked that he promise me that he would put in his best effort to do well. I still remember how he, without hesitation, agreed to do so. That year, he did come back, showed me his grades and it did reflect him doing well. And I was very glad for him. After a year, one of my residents came to see me asking for help, saying that he needed help for me to speak to his son. He explained that his family had financial difficulties and because he was a low-income worker. He said that his son wanted to quit school to be able to earn an income to help the family with its finances. He asked if I could convince his son to stay and continue his studies. So, I told him I would try my best and hope that we could do that. After he left, I asked my grassroots leader to please go and see if this is the boy that came to see me a year ago because we need to convince him that he needs to stay in school because his grades are good and we need to help his family.I am glad to say that we were able to convince him and he did continue with his studies and we were able to help his family. By sheer coincidence, I was invited to an ITE graduation ceremony and I witnessed the graduation of him and he was receiving an award and a scholarship to the Polytechnic. At that time, he informed me that, with his scholarship, his family could manage and he asked that we channel the support to other more needy families.Now, many years later, I recently met this young man. He now has a promising career and he and his family are doing very well. And he said this to me repeatedly. He said, \"I know the importance of opportunity and I am grateful that by continuing my studies, I was able to take the opportunities that came my way\". So, he had potential and he would have been able to help his family had he gone and found a job at that time. The fact that he was able to build on the foundation and acquire the skills to enable him to access better opportunities really made the difference for him and he is now clearly able to take on larger opportunities that come his way. Of course, his learning continues.So, why am I telling this story? Addressing current challenges and keeping businesses viable are important because, if they fail, Singaporeans who work for these organisations will lose their jobs and their livelihoods will be impacted. We must not, however, give up on building for the long term. I am glad that Budget 2020, while seeking to provide the much-needed support and help for workers and businesses to weather the short-term uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 situation and geopolitical tensions, is also balancing this with ensuring that we stay on track with the strategic economic transformation plans to prepare Singapore and Singaporeans for the longer term and to be ready for new opportunities.The structural shifts brought about by economic trends, technological disruptions and demographic changes require businesses and workers to transform and this will take time and effort. With the business slowdown, organisations must take the opportunity to execute these transformation plans and reskill their employees. As the famous quote attributed to Winston Churchhill says: \"Never let a good crisis go to waste\". In times of a crisis, it is also time for us to come together to find ways to address the challenges and also see opportunities that present themselves even in these difficult times.An important thrust of the Budget is the development of our people and supporting continual learning. The measures in this Budget support nurturing every Singaporean to achieve his or her full potential. And I must tell you this. It is a little bit disconcerting sometimes but I have residents who come and ask me, \"Can you get me approval to transfer my SkillsFuture credit to my family members?\" The reasons given are that they do not need this to learn new skills because they are too old or just that they do not need it or they think that other members of the family may have more need for training. The need to continually learn, unlearn and relearn is important for everyone, regardless of age or stage in life. This is to build confidence not only for employability but for active participation in life in an economy and society that is more complex and fast-changing. With change comes the need to be agile and to be able to handle ambiguity. Therefore, building relevant skills, picking up new knowledge and the ability to deal with change are key to not only availing oneself to employment opportunities, but also to enabling us to be confident to participate and thrive in society. This will impact an individual's quality of life. The challenge is how we can help as many Singaporeans as possible to understand what training is available, assess what is relevant for them and to make access to learning easy. Today, many more people are taking courses and, while this is encouraging as it shows the willingness to learn, we need to do more to ensure relevancy and the impact of the learning in helping with employability or addressing required life skills.Skills are important and we must develop deep skills to play and compete in the areas of new opportunities. But we must also recognise that skills and knowledge have a shelf life and do become obsolete. What is equally important is to develop in our people the underlying capability and capacity to learn and relearn to stay relevant, the ability to deal with change, ambiguity and the application of knowledge with the practicality and resolve to make things happen even when there is no charted path.I particularly like the focus on enhancing the role of enterprises in developing their staff. The various measures to encourage businesses to transform their business and redesign jobs, including giving enterprises more direct control over the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit Fund of $10,000 per company, enabling partnerships between employers, IHLs and the involvement of large anchor enterprises to support training for their sector and value chain partners, together with providing Singaporean students real-life learning work experience. This will better align training with what businesses require. This will, in turn, drive real productivity and value for both employers and employees.The new Asia Exposure Programme and the enhanced support for Internships under the Global Ready Talent Programme are also key platforms to give our young Singaporean students the opportunity to acquire cross-cultural skills and perspectives, developing networks of relationships and understanding of the region. This learning experience and exposure will better prepare our young to take advantage of new opportunities with the growth of Asia and add value to organisations that they join after they leave school.The current uncertainties are driving concerns on the implication for businesses, and workers; and workers are really worried about keeping their jobs. The short-term measures in the Stabilisation and Support Package will provide businesses some relief from the impact of the COVID-19 situation and will help workers retain their jobs. But while the support will help, the reliefs are short-term. No one can tell how long the COVID-19 situation will continue and more help may be required.We do have to recognise that for some businesses, the impact of the current uncertainties has been quite sharp and although their business operations have been viable, the drastic drop in business demand and impact on supply chain will have significant short-term operational and cashflow impacts. Going through the immediate challenges will have to be priority for them if they are to be able to keep jobs. While the Stabilisation and Support Package does provide some relief on wagecosts and funds training support, they may not be sufficient to help businesses. Employers will need to take the leadership oncost-management measures as well as partner with employees to help withcost-saving measures to protect jobs. Perhaps, more can be done to help businesses navigate existing programmes already in place that can complement Budget 2020 to manage this current business impact.While the number of self-employed workers and freelancers form a small proportion of the workforce, they too, are experiencing a drop in demand for their services and they may need help with support or maybe even to find an employment. And I do hope more can be done for this group of workers as well.The Budget's special focus on support for mid-career workers currently in their 40s and 50s who form a significant number of the workforce is welcomed. As Deputy Prime Minister Heng had said in the Budget, some in this segment have stayed with one company and have not made career changes since they left school. With the disruptions that we are seeing, the new technologies and the nature if jobs changing, many in this segment do need help to re-skill and more importantly, to adapt to the changes to compete for new opportunities.While training and re-skilling is important, knowing what the opportunities are and aligning the training to available job opportunities is key for mid-career workers to secure suitable employment. And I must tell you that I do see my residents in this age group, struggling with finding suitable employment and this is not because they have not tried. Anxiety levels are really quite high, not just for them, but also for their families. I am also somewhat concern with the emphasis on training and re-skilling with this Budget because if many are trained and yet, they are not able to find suitable employment, we may have a situation where there is even greater frustration and anxiety.For the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs), there is an online listing of roles and industries from different industries – from Precision Engineering, InfoComm, Food Manufacturing, Logistics and many more – outlining the scope of the application criteria and requirements for participating companies. What is the current number of available jobs that the PCPs have, either in the \"Place-and-Train\" orthe \"Attach-and-Train\", and how can mid-career workers avail themselves to these opportunities?As we focus on supporting mid-career workers to develop new skills, we also have to find new pathways to allow these workers to learn new skills, and at the same time build upon the relevant skills and experience that they have built over the years. Sometimes, I feel that when we talk about re-skilling, we forget that these mid-career workers bring a wealth of knowledge, capabilities and experience that we should leverage on while we help them with re-skilling. This is something that I hope we can pay some attention to, because otherwise, it will be a waste of opportunities and also wasted skills. For example, if data analytics is the area of focus, as we re-skill the individual for this, how do we also look at his/her experience – perhaps we can say it is marketing,or management – and say how do you avail them to be able to use these skills across different industries and roles as they pick up this new skill. I think that is a critical area and it is an important area that we have to focused on.Another area that I would also like to highlight is as we encourage employers to recruit, retain and re-skill mid-career Singaporeans, we must recognise that the current employment policies and practices need to also align. And what do I mean by that? Let me give you an example. For organisations, when they look at on-boarding their staff, they look at on-boarding staff to the new environment in the office, to the company and the company's policies and practices and business. For the mid-career worker, what is additionally required is also the on-boarding and transition to a new industry when you are looking at re-skilling and job role changes. I can tell that to you personally because I have experienced that. I have changed industries. And it can be extremely scary because you suddenly find yourself in situations where you do not even know what questions to ask, because you may not know what you do not know of your new industry. That kind of orientation – on-boarding and so on – is very important as well as the support systems to be put in place for that. Performance systems and management systems need to also evolve in the same way.I am also encouraged that Budget 2020 focuses on supporting the building of social capability and capacity to foster a climate of change in our community and to channel the energies of our people around important social causes. Beyond the provision of funding, equally important is these platforms to encourage ground-up participation and bringing stakeholders together to catalyse more ground-up initiatives, crowd source ideas and drive innovation. The partnership of our people, businesses and Government to address social challenges together will help build a more cohesive and resilient Singapore for all Singaporeans. With that, I support the Budget.1.07 pmMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied): Mr Speaker, the Government has called this year's Budget, a \"Unity Budget\". Following from the theme of unity, the focus of my speech today is Unity Amidst Disruption.Of all the areas covered by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat's Budget speech, I was especially interested in the section on Navigating Long-Term Structural Shifts. He acknowledged the global decline in support for globalisation, with protectionism and nativism on the rise. On my part, I have been studying the phenomenon of globalisation for a while, and I would argue that the main debate today is not between those who support or reject globalisation. Instead, it is a more nuanced and constructive debate, about the kind of globalisation we should strive for, that would improve human welfare in a sustainable way. Those who advocate such human-centred globalisation are sometimes called \"alternative globalisers\".At the outset, I should say that Singapore has been a major beneficiary of globalisation, with the Government providing leadership in this endeavour over the years. We have benefited from open trade, foreign investment and becoming a global financial centre. We are increasingly becoming a global knowledge hub. While these benefits are undeniable, the question is how the \"losers\" from globalisation are treated.In 2006, when Singapore hosted the World Bank meetings, we were met head-on by protestors who came from abroad to make their customary presence felt at these meetings. While some may see them as disruptive and a nuisance, it is increasingly acknowledged that their underlying concerns were valid. These were concerns about the excesses of global capitalism, such as market destabilisation, exploitation of workers in poorer countries and the destruction of the environment through pollution.Though some far-right groups in the world today seem to reject globalisation outright, this is not constructive, as it is simply not possible to unwind today's world of inter-connectedness and multi-polar supply chains. The most useful debate today is between the Neoliberalists, who overwhelmingly believe in the global free market, and the Reformists, who argue that global capitalism can be a force for good only when accompanied by policies that promote equitable growth, human security and sustainable development.Today, three decades after globalisation took off, the protestors' core concerns are being recognised in the halls of power. Climate Change is on the international agenda and in this Budget. The OECD has sponsored work on subjective well-being and social welfare. Green financing is gaining momentum, with EU law requiring large companies to publish climate-related financial disclosures.International financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, have had a re-think about their policies too. This is especially so after the experience of the Asian Financial Crisis and the collapse of Latin American economies that took their advice. It is now acknowledged by these institutions that different countries are at different states of readiness, that there can be no universal set of rules for everyone. Indeed, the relative success of China and India in the era of globalisation has been attributed to their opening up of their markets in an incremental manner, giving local enterprises and workers time to adapt.The lessons from the 1990s show that governments have an important role to play, to actively manage globalisation for their respective countries. The World Bank highlights that governments need to pay attention to the aspect of human security, such as through targeted poverty reduction and social safety nets.Sir, I believe the Singapore Government knows this literature all too well. Though the Government does not label its initiatives in terms of alternative globalisation, some of its policies including in this Budget seek to mitigate the harsh impacts of economic liberalisation on Singaporeans. There are various schemes for targeted poverty reduction, for example, through rebates and other financial transfers weighted in favour of the poor. There are also important social safety nets, such as retraining and re-skilling efforts, which it is now re-doubling on.Yet, as Deputy Prime Minister Heng acknowledges, workers have anxiety, especially those in their 40s and 50s. It is useful to unpack the source of such anxiety. Workers in their 40s and 50s are at a stage of their lives when they can least afford income disruption: they have children to raise, mortgages to pay and elderly parents who may be ailing and need financial support. Disruption can come anytime, through industries being off-shored elsewhere, or by being displaced through foreign competition within Singapore. To this end, I agree with the Government's effort in this Budget to boost the hiring of locals and mid-career transitioners, by reducing the S Pass sub-DRC in the Construction, Marine and Process industries.Despite all these efforts, mid-career workers' anxiety will be hard to assuage. Why? Transitions into new industries take time. There could be mismatch between openings and applicants. Seeking assistance from Government agencies also positions the citizen as someone applying for help, which can be a humbling experience. All this can be a tremendous mental and emotional strain on the whole family. To illustrate, I know of one retrenched man, who has still not told his wife that he lost his job some months ago; every day he leaves home as usual and comes back at the usual time, while trying to find another job.In dealing with the long-term structural shifts, the Government has devoted significant resources to enable workers to skill-up and transit to other industries. This is certainly needed. But is it time now to consider other measures too, that Singaporeans can tap on more seamlessly, and for security and peace of mind? It had always been a tenet of this Government to promote self-reliance among Singaporeans. Singaporeans, too, prefer to be self-reliant and not have to seek Government assistance at every turn.With the weak economic outlook and soft job market, it may be the time to re-examine some policy approaches. For instance, I know of some mid-career employees who had been laid off and turned to Government agencies for assistance, but were unable to secure work for months, a point Ms Jessica Tan alluded to earlier as well. Some of them wanted to chart their own re-skilling towards a professional qualification in another field, which would require a significant cash outlay. One measure, which I think should be considered, is allowing more liberal use of CPF savings for education and re-skilling. This would be reasonable for CPF members whose savings already exceed the applicable Minimum Sums. I will speak more about this at MOM's Committee of Supply debate.Another measure for consideration is some sort of redundancy insurance. This has been previously debated in this House, with the Government calling it, \"not a crazy idea\", but preferring its current approach of job creation and re-skilling. How confident is the Government that its existing schemes will be able to find solutions for everyone who applies?Today's economic climate illustrates how such insurance could provide a stabiliser to workers, to soften the cliff-edge that they face with job disruption. Suffice to say for now, Sir, that the Government would need to re-assess its approaches periodically, as economic and technological realities change. If the anxiety of citizens is not taken seriously enough, the door to populism and nativism will widen.Mr Speaker, I have tried in this speech to sketch out how globalisation has largely been a boon, especially to Asia and to Singapore. The forces of globalisation also pressure us to constantly up our game, re-skill and be prepared to be uprooted to stay relevant. This transition is not easy, and I appreciate that the Government has poured in resources to support Singaporeans in re-skilling and career transition. However, the anxiety and insecurity aspects will also need to be addressed adequately, in order to shore up the concept of unity which is the theme of this Budget.Mr Speaker: Minister Ng Chee Meng.1.16 pmThe Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Ng Chee Meng): Mr Speaker, we have had a challenging start to 2020. Singaporeans ushered in the new year amidst slowing economic growth and geo-strategic uncertainties. With COVID-19, this has further impacted the health of our economy. Although the severity of COVID-19 remains unclear, the Labour Movement will work closely with the Government and businesses to tackle the spread of the disease and protect workers.I would like to thank workers on the frontlines, who are working tirelessly to keep us all going: our medical staff, drivers, air crews, cleaners, security officers and many more. Thank you.Mr Speaker, we are not unfamiliar with the current situation, given our experience with SARS. We are now much better prepared to tackle an infectious disease outbreak such as COVID-19. Our medical infrastructure, public health knowledge and training have improved significantly over the years.However, this time round, we are facing a deeper, more wide-ranging impact to our economy than before. Our world is now much more interconnected with China and the disruption to China's economy is starting to cause far-reaching ripple effects that have affected Singapore as well.So, let us all be mentally prepared and importantly, ready ourselves, stay strong, and overcome any challenges that come our way.As Secretary-General of NTUC, I commend the Government's swift and collected response to the outbreak. The strong Budget this year reflects the whole-of-Government approach to tackling the virus and maintaining our workers' confidence in the economy.Over the past few weeks, the Labour Movement has been hard at work collecting worker feedback through our union leaders, industrial relations officers and from employer partners. Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has factored this feedback into the Budget.During this difficult time, workers are understandably worried for the health of their loved ones, friends and co-workers. Additionally, workers in some of the hardest hit sectors are facing daily disruptions and as Members have said before, they are worried about sustaining a steady income in this uncertain environment.Just to give you a sense, hotel occupancy rates have gone down to as low as 35% or worse, from highs of 85% and more. Our taxi and private hire drivers have given me feedback that income has dipped of up to 40%. And even attractions in Singapore have seen visitorship drop by as much as 90%. So, many workers are anxious. They do not know if they can keep their jobs and worry about reduced incomes, given less work, less overtime.As for employer feedback, we are starting to see delays in the supply chain as the reach of COVID-19 deepens. Also, some companies are suffering from a shortage of labour, while ironically, other sectors have excess capacity.I am heartened to see the Budget address these issues and many more.The $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package announced by the Government will help businesses across industries and specific sectors most affected by the outbreak, to help them defray businesscosts. Our workers can take comfort in knowing that the help for businesses will also help them keep their jobs and incomes. The $1.6 billion Care and Support Package shows care for workers and addresses the needs of older workers, young families, the lower income and our future generations.On NTUC's part, we are doing what we can to help and protect our workers and their families.Our union leaders are working hard to help companies manage excess manpower and reducecosts by arranging for subsidised worker training and upskilling through NTUC Learning Hub and NTUC e2i during this lull period. In some cases, this is arranged through our Company Training Committees which we launched last year and have proven useful.We are also looking at ways in which we can help workers, in particular PMEs, with their job worries.Something that could help is a pilot that NTUC is introducing this year, called the NTUC Job Security Council. I will explain more on this shortly, in response also to Ms Jessica Tan and Ms Sylvia Lim's point about worried workers.For the self-employed, the Labour Movement is working together with Government agencies to help cushion the financial blow and organise relevant training.Whilst we work together to overcome today’s challenges, I support the Government's $8.3 billion Transformation and Growth effort to transform our economy and prepare for the realities and opportunities that lie ahead.Singapore continues to face long term challenges. Industry 4.0 is changing the nature of many jobs and creating new types of work: from 3D printing of our HDB flats, to friendly chatbots providing 24/7 frontline service to customers. All these are exciting opportunities which, if we can seize, will bring greater possibilities for our economy and for our workers.And our labour force is also changing. Our resident labour growth is slowing and our workforce is ageing. There are now more PMEs in the workforce with better education and, in contrast, the proportion of rank-and-file workers is declining.I know that it can be difficult to think about structural change over the long term while we are facing immediate concerns that seem so much more pressing. In these circumstances, workers do tell me that they sometimes struggle to keep up with these new realities. They are prepared for transformation and change but at the same time, these cause them much worry, whether they can adapt to these new realities.But the Labour Movement wants to assure every worker that you matter and we will do our best to support you during this time.And, in my view, every job counts.And there is one thing we must do to enhance and that is to bring better job security for our workers. We believe that job security is the umbrella that protects our workers from passing thunderstorms.In today's context, job security does not necessarily mean guaranteeing a job for life.Times have changed. More and more, job security means providing workers with what they need for skills progression and job placement, which ultimately will improve their work prospects that would bring them more confidence and give themselves, the workers and their families peace of mind in the new economy.Our NTUC Labour Members of Parliament will be speaking today on how we are working to ensure job security for every worker: older workers, women in the workforce, and especially the most vulnerable segments of our population, such as the lower income and the self-employed workers.Ms Jessica Tan was almost speaking like a Labour Member of Parliament. And given that she has an important appointment as Director in Raffles Medical Group, it is music to my ears to hear an employer speaking in Parliament, calling for more to be done for our workers.Let me elaborate on some of the tools with which we can promote job security for all workers, as Ms Sylvia Lim has also articulated.NTUC introduced the Company Training Committees last year for union leaders and their management partners to work together for the company to drive towards transformation in partnership.I am glad to hear Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat mention the benefits that the Company Training Committee platform has brought to our businesses and workers. These CTCs enable companies to refresh and deepen workers' skillsets in line with new technologies and importantly, tap on Government resources, such as the new SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit to aid with the needed training.They have also the added benefit of providing a ready-made platform, avenue for management to discuss more immediate issues with the union, such as manpower andcost concerns arising out of COVID-19 today. Not originally intended but necessarily a good tool now for CTCs to enable the discussions between management and workers to think about training in the lull period.Wildlife Reserves Singapore, which manages the Singapore Zoo, the Jurong Bird Park and other attractions has, as I said earlier, experienced a significant drop in visitor arrivals because of COVID-19.Through a recent Company Training Committee meeting with the management, and in my discussion with them just this Monday, our unions proposed sending the workers for training and upskilling during this downtime. This will build the company's and the workers' capabilities in tandem and prepare them when the upturn in the economy comes, when more visitors come back to the Singapore Zoo and the Jurong Bird Park. Such a move will also give their workers the added assurance that they can continue with their jobs – less anxiety.And I am happy to see that Wildlife Reserves Singapore is fully on-board. The company is particularly keen to build on their digital roadmap with the help of NTUC Learning Hub to identify and customise relevant courses, such as SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace, for its workforce of about 1,100 workers. These courses will help shape Worker 4.0, actualise the value of technology in the workplace and equally importantly, help workers improve their work prospects and job security over time.When we first announced the Company Training Committees last year, the Labour Movement made a goal to have 1,000 CTCs in three years. I am pleased to update the House that we are well on our way to meeting this target. To-date, we have formed 352 CTCs and we are starting to see workers in companies, such as Wildlife Reserves Singapore, reap the benefits of this partnership. So, well done, Wildlife Reserves Singapore and our unions, Attractions, Resorts and Entertainment Union (AREU) and the Singapore Manual and Mercantile Workers' Union (SMMWU).However, we can do more. There are still some workers who continue to fall through the gaps.Through my conversations, I have noticed. as many of your have, that there is a growing concern among workers, especially those in their 40s to 50s and, more often, PMEs who find themselves displaced or retrenched because their skills have become redundant as technologies evolve. And if they are retrenched, they can take a long time to get back into a job and one which may not pay as well or may not even fully utilise their skills.Although these numbers are not large, for the individual worker or PME, who has mouths to feed and bills to pay, the situation can cause a lot of fear and anxiety. NTUC wants to ease this situation and help these workers and PMEs.While the Labour Movement has already been training and matching workers on an informal basis, we want to formalise this process. NTUC is therefore piloting the NTUC Job Security Council, to improve the matching of displaced or retrenched workers into new jobs.We will create an eco-system of \"releasing\" companies and \"receiving\" companies: \"receiving\" companies being those which can absorb skilled workers and PMEs into their workplace from the \"releasing\" companies.The Job Security Council will work with companies to gather information on the job vacancies, jobs that may be phased out and importantly, jobs that could be redesigned for workers and PMEs. The Job Security Council will then match these workers and PMEs to vacancies within this network and where needed, identify the new skillsets required and top up workers' and PMEs' skills, where necessary, with the necessary training.The Job Security Council can also help companies access the many Government schemes, such as the new SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package. All these schemes are intended to enhance skilling and placement efforts for local workers and PMEs. And NTUC or this Job Security Council can be the conduit to focus workers and companies on accessing the grants to help the workers seek new jobs and upgrade their skills.The pilot will start with more than 4,000 companies. We have strong support from our valued tripartite partner, the Singapore National Employers Federation and many other Trade Associations and Chambers, such as the Workforce Advancement Federation supporting local SMEs, the Singapore Manufacturing Federation and the Specialists Trade Alliance of Singapore from the building and construction industry. These 4,000-plus companies come from a wide range and diverse industries and are of many different sizes. I am excited to see MNCs such as Rolls Royce and GE Aviation coming on board. I visited Rolls Royce recently and was impressed by their dedication and commitment of the management to the workforce.We have also some start-ups, local start-ups and SMEs such as Ebenezer Group in the Engineering sector, Blue Ventures Holdings in the Wholesale Trade as well as Swee Heng Bakery and Montreux Patisserie in the Food and Beverage sector.Swee Heng Bakery is a household name and has been in the bakery scene for just over 30 years. Their efforts to keep relevant, causes them to up technology and in the process, partnering e2i to up the skills of the workers in using machinery and upping their productivity so that they can remain relevant and do a thriving business.All these companies will stand to benefit from a lowercost ready-made recruitment tool through the Job Security Council; and with the added bonus of training and skills upgrading for our workers.Companies will also have access to a community of HR personnel and senior management sharing best practices and progressive employment standards.Through the Job Security Council, we want to create a win-win for companies and our workers. We hope to lessen the anxiety for workers and PMEs, and assure them that NTUC, the Labour Movement is doing what we can to help them find good jobs.We look forward to taking this pilot further and we call on companies who may not have yet joined us to contact NTUC to come on board. So, Ms Jessica Tan, I expect a call from Raffles soon. Mr Speaker, in Mandarin, please.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]I have been very concerned about the employment situation of our workers, especially the middle-aged workers and PMEs who are in their 40s to 50s. Many who lost their jobs shared with me that they faced all kinds of difficulties finding a new job.A year ago, we started exploring ways to help these workers. In the past half year, NTUC’s e2i has been in talks with many companies to join the NTUC Job Security Council.Companies that join the Job Security Council – a handful may reduce manpower but many more want to hire workers. Through the Job Security Council, workers who are at risk of losing their jobs will be matched to companies that have suitable jobs for them. And if workers need to have different skills to take on the new jobs, e2i will arrange for them to undergo training and upskill themselves.To date, we have more than 4,000 companies on board the NTUC Job Security Council, employing a total of more than 500,000 workers. More than 90% of these companies are SMEs.We will continue to work with companies from more sectors and get them on board the Job Security Council so that more workers can benefit.(In English): Mr Speaker, I will conclude. Around the world, the social compact in many societies is breaking down. The trust citizens have for their political leaders is eroding.But in Singapore, we have the trust of Singaporeans. It is something that we must never take for granted. In Singapore, we enjoy the fruits of hard-earned tripartism, which has brought us economic resilience and social stability. Underpinned by this year's strong Budget, all these will ensure that Singaporeans’ lives are uplifted together.The Labour Movement will continue to work with our Government and employers to improve the social and economic well-being of Singapore and Singaporeans. To this end, we will continue to strengthen and adapt the uniquely Singapore social compact so that it will stand the test of time. Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Budget. [Applause.]Mr Speaker: Mr Patrick Tay.1.35 pmMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast): Mr Speaker Sir, I rise in support of this year's Budget. Today, as we debate Budget 2020, Singapore as a country must grapple with the round-the-clock challenge of battling with COVID-19. This is over and above the continued race to keep up with the rise of digitalisation, new technologies and economic transformation. Against the backdrop of these exacting forces, the future of work, workers and workplaces will – and must – evolve and transform.Thus far, many union leaders, workers as well as my grassroots leaders and residents have shared positive feedback about this year’s Budget. At a personal level, I am sure the Stabilisation and Support Package announced at Budget 2020 will be a boon to both businesses and workers, as it provides assurance and support in this time of economic uncertainty and ensure every worker matters and every job counts. On one hand, businesses will receive job and cash flow support to retain and retrain workers. On the other hand, our workers – from the young and mid-career to older workers – will get a much-needed boost, through the various SkillsFuture Credit schemes to upgrade, upskill and stay employable. What is particularly reassuring, is that Deputy Prime Minister Heng has also stated affirmatively in his speech that the Government is prepared to do more should the need arise.This year’s Budget is seen as an expensive as well as an expansive one. I am particularly happy and delighted with three items fleshed out in the Budget because it has answered three calls which I have been making in this House.First, is the $500 SkillsFuture Credit top up for all Singaporeans, which I have been lobbying for over the past two years. Some of you may not know but what is particularly beneficial and useful is that freelancers and self-employed individuals can also tap on their SkillsFuture Credits to learn new skills or even develop in their field. I am heartened, therefore, that this top-up will give all Singaporeans aged 25 and above, an added push, as they make lifelong learning a way of life.Second, is the added focus on mid-career workers between the ages of 40 to 60 years old through the various programmes and policies. Based on labour market statistics and reports, this group continues to be the most vulnerable and affected by retrenchments, with higher skilled, middle-aged PMEs the hardest hit. Mature and older workers, including PMEs, also face greater difficulty in the job market with the long-term unemployment rate of Singaporeans climbing with age. For those who are unemployed or retrenched, re-entry into the labour market is also an uphill task. In my interactions with mature workers, and especially PMEs, they have shared their concerns about being made redundant by younger colleagues or being replaced by technology and job automation. In short, they worry about staying employed and employable.Third, would be the creation of the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit for Employers. This is also something I have suggested in this House. I hope this credit for employers will serve as a catalyst for companies, especially SMEs, to develop their workforce as they transform their business, by embracing and investing in skills upgrading and training of their workers. In particular, the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit will further augment and complement existing efforts by the NTUC and our affiliated unions to partner companies in forming Company Training Committees. These efforts, which were introduced last year, aim to equip workers across all sectors and all sizes of companies with the necessary skills, so that they can secure better wages, better welfare and better work prospects.Notwithstanding a laudable budget, I have five specific suggestions for consideration.First, to speed up the disbursement of Jobs Support Scheme and SkillsFuture Top-Up. In the near term, some companies that are directly affected are already feeling the effects of economic fallout brought about by COVID-19 and any immediate relief is welcomed. As such, can the disbursement of the Jobs Support Scheme be brought forward from the start date of July 2020?In the same vein, many workers, especially the freelance and self-employed, have asked if the SkillsFuture Top-up originally scheduled in October 2020 can be rolled-out earlier, so that they can make use of this period of downtime to embark on the relevant training. As I urge the speeding up of disbursements, I also suggest for the Government's support to lengthen and stretch the validity of these schemes should the situation worsen or become prolonged.Second is to expand the Training Support for Mid-Career Singaporeans. My second suggestion is not to confine the additional top-up for those aged 40 to 60 years old only to those 200 career transition programmes offered by the CET centres as outlined in Annex B-2 to the Budget Statement. I urge for the courses availed to include those recognised under the ITM Skills Framework as well as suitable Government and NTUC run courses and programmes and those of our company training committees. By the same token, to minimise jobs and skills mismatches, career advisors could look at providing peer-level support for this group and additional support such as coaching to identify skills gaps and training intervention that may be needed.Third is to restore the Surrogate Employer Programme. During the SARS crisis in 2003, I was in NTUC overseeing the Surrogate Employer Programme, where NTUC acted as a surrogate employer and helped many of those affected by the downturn such as Tour Guides as well as SIA's Cabin Crew who were on unpaid leave, to go for training and upgrading while benefiting from a training allowance. These efforts resulted in a win-win-win for all, in that when the Singapore economy rebounded months later, affected workers who had the training allowance as stipend, could now return to their jobs and assignments quickly to the delight of their employers and customers. In addition, they were now armed with additional qualifications such as a Diploma in Hospitality or other related certifications. I see a good opportunity for us to revisit and reintroduce this scheme to support workers who may fall through the cracks or those not covered under the current schemes such as our freelancers and self-employed Singaporeans.To further support this group of workers, could the Government also look at extending calibrated wage support through sector agencies to help them cope with the immediate impact brought about by the current economic situation. NTUC stands ready to partner the Government to administer the Surrogate Employer Programme so that this group of workers can also benefit from training assistance and incentives.Fourth, to raise the absentee payroll and course fee funding. In light of the current situation, as well as business slowdown for many industries and possibility of recession, the Government can step in to provide an additional nudge and incentive for employers to send all their workers for training and skills upgrading through increasing the absentee payroll and course fee funding. Minimally, I submit that this enhanced critical funding can help to address the vulnerabilities of the mature and older workers in this time and space.Today, the world has changed and continues to change. Against an increasingly uncertain global environment and an economy that is facing challenges both in the short term and long term, many of our workers are understandably worried that their jobs will be impacted.To ensure job security for workers, my fifth suggestion would be the formation of Job Security Councils. As NTUC Secretary-General and Minister Ng Chee Meng has shared, NTUC will be piloting a Jobs Security Council, JSC, for short, to pre-emptively match at-risk workers and PMEs into jobs. Through the JSC, NTUC and its affiliated unions will help displaced workers find new jobs within the network – and where necessary, provide the requisite training to help workers smoothly transition from one job to another. Mr Speaker, in Mandarin please.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]The COVID-19 outbreak will undoubtedly affect our economy. Many workers have told me that they were worried about their jobs. I fully understand their concerns.The new Budget, as announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng, is both assuring and stimulating. Not only does it address the immediate needs but also focus on long-term planning. With regard to this, I have five suggestions:First, speed up the disbursement of the Jobs Support Scheme and the additional $500 SkillsFuture Top-up, encouraging businesses and workers to make use this period of down time to restructure, train and upgrade.Second, allow Singaporeans between 40 to 60 years old to have more courses availed to them, including those recognised under the ITM Skills Framework or relevant courses offered by NTUC.Third, restore the Surrogate Employer Programme so that freelancers, self-employed persons or certain neglected workers can also receive allowances during their absence so that they can go for courses for upgrading.Fourth, raise the absentee payroll to encourage businesses to send their workers for training.Fifth, at the same time, we must pay attention to jobs security of our workers. As NTUC Secretary-General Ng Chee Meng has announced, NTUC will set up a Jobs Security Council to help retrenched workers with job matching and necessary training through e2i.(In English): My view is that this is a comprehensive and inclusive Budget – one that will help Singapore overcome our short-term challenges and at the same time prepare ourselves for future threats, disruptions and opportunities. I urge our tripartite partners and all of us in Singapore to rally together, stay united and look out for one another. This is so that we can navigate and overcome this rough patch together, and then ride on the wave of change and embrace the upturn thereafter as one Singapore.1.46 pmMr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Budget. The COVID-19 crisis is named for the last day of last year on 31 December 2019, China informed the World Health Organization of a novel virus pneumonia in Wuhan.Singapore has close links with China. Our Changi Airport receives an average of 330,000 visitors from China each month. On 2 January, MOH alerted all doctors to identify any patient with pneumonia and a recent travel history to Wuhan. A day later, we started temperature screening at our airport of all travellers arriving from Wuhan.More information starting coming out from China, including the vital fact that the virus could be transmitted from human. By then, it was late January. On 23 January, Singapore diagnosed its first case of COVID-19, a tourist from Wuhan. Since then, we have seen the best, and the worst of ourselves. The heroes in this fight are undoubtedly the healthcare staff – doctors, nurses and all in the healthcare industry – who work under incredible pressures and fears.Nurses who care for COVID-19 patients are working with cumbersome masks and protective wear. Those of us who have worn an N95 will know how hard it is to breath under one of these, even for half an hour. Yet they have to go through entire working days with these, sometimes doing delicate work, taking blood and other procedures, all the while knowing that these bodily fluids are infected. There is a real risk. And many of these same people would have worked at their jobs when we had SARS.When they can finally take off their equipment, clean up and go to lunch, some of them are unfortunately shunned and avoided. On trains and buses, their uniforms are a badge for isolation. Unfortunately, there are some who mocked the great, who toiled so hard and late.Prime Minister Lee, our Ministers, our union leaders and community leaders have all made many visits to these workers, openly standing shoulder to shoulder with them, no masks, just smiles.I also count among these, the selfless and courageous grassroots volunteers. In the distribution of masks exercise, many volunteers stepped forward to make the whole process seamless and smooth. There are also others who declined their quota of masks, saying to give them to others as they already have secured their supply of face masks.Then, there are the students of our Universities which give me hope for the future. I saw on television a student's union President Mr Richard Wang, who delivered food to his fellow students regularly and without complaint. Then, there was SCDF Corporal Mohd Shahrom who picked up a patient suspected to have, and later confirmed to have the virus. And then, there was Mr Keith Aw, from MOM, who checked on foreign workers on Leave of Absence, speaking to them for up to 10 minutes a time.All these people act, not because they have no fear, but they act in spite of fear. There is no Budget measure that accounts for greatness.I also want to speak about the wise – the key decision makers, including public health officials who have acted so quickly and decisively in this crisis. Contact tracing and quarantine orders were swiftly issued. We instituted travel declarations and entry restrictions; there were also leave of absence from work and stay home notices that were instituted.These are not easy decisions and cause a lot of disruption to people's lives and livelihoods. But the price of leadership is to sacrifice the popular for the right.For many of us in this House, this solidarity reminds us of SARS in 2003 when 238 people were infected with 33 fatalities. Since that time, we have the new National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), we have also built a national stockpile of face masks. This again, is the prescience of those who are wise among us.The leaders who have made all the difficult calls. Not just the Cabinet Ministers but the men and women on the ground who have had to make difficult calls at a time of fear and panic. And, of course, the opportunists will mock the wise, they will spew untruths and outright lies. Even in such trying times, some would take the opportunity to spread fake news. The POFMA office was kept busy during this period too. I am glad that we have POFMA. Left unchecked, the spread of deliberate online falsehoods will have serious consequences which society will ultimately have to pay a heavy price for.I count these measures that we have outlined in this Budget to be among the wise decisions. Overall, there is nothing much that one can find fault with our Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister in this year’s Unity Budget. I would like to confine my comments to SMEs and have a couple of suggestions for the Finance Minister to consider.For promising SMEs, the Government has announced that ESG will launch an Enterprise Transform package with focus on leadership. It will also support business leaders of 900 SMEs over the next three years with training and mentorship.This is a much welcome move. However, smaller SMEs might have issues understanding Government initiatives and programmes in English and so I suggest such initiatives and programmes to be translated into Mandarin, Malay and Tamil so that the wider business communities can understand and embark on such initiatives. The language gap requires another sort of translation. We need to make these schemes more accessible by showing SMEs how such Government grants can help them so that they do not miss out on them.The Government has also announced COVID-19 relief measures to support SMEs in affected sectors in the form of tax rebates, bridging loans, rental waivers, wage subsidies, higher absentee payroll and training course subsidies, foreign worker levy waivers and so on. These are certainly appreciated by SMEs and businesses. However, there are some gaps.First, the ground feedback that I have received is that the Job Support Scheme to be given out in July 2020 is rather late and does little to help mitigate cash-flow issues. Time is of the essence for these SMEs as the adverse business impact they are facing now due to COVID-19 is a significant one and they are crying out for help with urgency.Second, there is no additional Absentee Payroll and training course subsidies for enterprises affected by COVID-19 to send excess manpower for training.Third, there is no foreign worker levy waiver for enterprises affected by COVID-19, especially when foreign workers represent a significant manpower share in the food services and retail sectors.I hope the Government will consider and see if these gaps can be addressed.The day that Singapore announced that it was going DORSCON Orange, there was frenzied buying at the supermarkets. But it was not the long queues at the supermarkets but the long queues later for a separate matter that I would like to remember.Two weeks ago, the Red Cross Singapore called for Singaporeans to donate their blood as blood stock levels for some blood types were running critically low. Many came forward – there were crowds of Singaporeans at the four blood banks around the island. Meantime, there are other stories of people being incredibly altruistic – leaving sanitizers and masks for their neighbours.Then unfortunately there are those who take advantage of this crisis, to do great harm. MOH had to release a statement to warn the community of scam calls impersonating the MOH Contact Tracing team in an attempt to retrieve personal financial details. The Police have also arrested five people for their suspected involvement in five separate e-commerce scams involving the online sale of face masks.There are those among us who are great and wise and good. And there will always be those who mock them. Those who use fake news or false news. Those who are socially irresponsible. Those who behave badly.What about those of us, who are neither great, nor wise, nor good? We ordinary men and women of Singapore can be decent. As you know, Fairprice was caught up in this panic buying. As the Group CEO of NTUC Fairprice, I witnessed first hand the shopping frenzy by many people on those two days – Friday and Saturday. This shopping behaviour was quite broad-based covering all age groups, races and social strata.To instil calm to all, NTUC Fairprice instituted a variety of measures including the imposition of purchase limits on some items; as to be expected, when this was first announced, it attracted quite a lot of noise and there was a minority group that criticised our move but I would say a large majority were in favour. In fact, many of them suggested to me that when this episode is over, FairPrice should not allow people who stock up to return their excess goods to us to get a refund. This is actually our standard policy. This so as to teach people a lesson on buying responsibly and not hoard first only to return the stocks later. I thank everyone who have given me various suggestions – I think what we will do is to encourage all those who had bought probably a bit too much to consider donating their excess stocks to Food Bank or Food from the Heart. Maybe I will set up a collection counter for them too.At the same time, I am also heartened and warmed by the many calls from members of the public who reached out to me to volunteer their services to help out in any crisis, if needed.As I look back over the last one month, I see a Government that has led from the front, been decisive in managing this crisis and coming up with a comprehensive, assuring and caring Budget that takes care of businesses and citizens alike whilst transforming, supporting and building a sustainable Singapore .Even in the aspect of face masks, I think Singapore may be the only country in the world to ensure that every citizen, every household has some face masks at their home.Mr Speaker, this Budget is for all of us, those among us who are great and wise and good. Those who mock them – purveyor of false news, socially irresponsible, the boors of society. Most of all, the Budget is for the ordinary men and women of Singapore who are decent and care for our fellowmen, who would work together to stem out the foul storm that is facing Singapore. This Budget has something for us all, and I thank the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng and his team for their inclusive and thoughtful rendering that is this Unity Budget.1.58 pmMr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar): Mr Speaker, COVID-19 has grabbed headlines as the first major public health emergency of this new decade, and I am glad to see that the Government is dedicating a substantial $5.6 billion to help businesses and workers most affected by the crisis.But while our nation unites to tackle the pandemic, we must not forget that long-term structural challenges – such as the declining support for globalisation, an ageing workforce and the uncertainties surrounding our economy – continue to persist. More worryingly, some of these challenges are now being accelerated due to COVID-19. The confluence of these factors will impact our entire economy, and I am heartened to note that the Government will be investing $8.3 billion to drive industry transformation and develop our workers for the future. However, more can be done to help our PMETs, which according to a 2019 report published by DBS Senior Economist, Irvin Seah, PMETs are now the \"new vulnerables\" among our workforce.My speech today will focus on how we can help vulnerable PMETs stay employed, be more employable and help those who are feeling “sandwiched” financially. Let me elaborate.Mr Speaker, I am happy to note that Budget 2020 has placed an emphasis on helping mid-career PMETs, currently in their 40s and 50s, through the Mid-Career Support Package. This is a timely move as PMETs in this age group are arguably at one of the most vulnerable stages in their careers. And they are vulnerable in two key areas – employment and employability.Let me first touch on employment vulnerability, or better known as job security. Employment data over the past decade has shown that PMETs are increasingly at risk of being retrenched. According to the retrenchment statistics released by MOM, the proportion of PMETs among workers being retrenched annually has grown from 37% in 2008 to 65% in 2018. This upward trend is unlikely to be reversed anytime soon and will be accelerated in the event of an economic downturn.PMETs, particularly those in their mid-career, are also vulnerable in terms of employability. Those who do not keep their skill sets current will find it hard to secure new jobs when they are displaced. As the Deputy Prime Minister noted in his Budget speech, many of our mid-career PMETs grew up in a time when it is seen as the norm to stay in one company for life until retirement. However, with technology cycles shorter than ever, many are now at risk of being displaced by fresh graduates if they do not equip themselves with new technical and new technology skills.Quantitatively, we are already seeing this trend happening. If we analyse the rate of re-entry into employment among retrenched residents from MOM's Labour Market Survey, it shows that workers aged 40 and above have lower re-entry rates than their younger counterparts.So, how then, can we better support this group of vulnerable mid-career PMETs to have better job security, and boost their employability if and when they get displaced? I am proposing three strategies: (a) build a strong eco-system of job security support within each sector; (b) bring training closer to our mid-career PMETs; and (c) equip them with adaptive skills beyond technical and technology skills.Let me start with providing better job security support to our PMETs. First, I would like to commend Budget 2020 for introducing the Stabilisation and Support Package amounting to $4 billion, which will support our enterprises in keeping their workers during the economic slowdown and position them to rebound quickly once the crisis is over.However, in the longer term, we need to ensure that our economic sectors are self-sustaining. And in my view, the concept of the Job Security Council, which the NTUC Secretary-General Mr Ng Chee Meng had highlighted in his speech earlier, is a useful way forward. By creating a structure to formalise the matching of displaced workers in an affected sector to a growing sector in need of manpower, we will be able to achieve a more resilient employment landscape. The NTUC Job Security Council will benefit all working professionals and will go a long way to mitigate the increased risk of retrenchments that our PMETs face in today’s fast-changing operating environment. I am therefore glad to see such strong support during the pilot phase and I urge more companies to come on board this initiative.Mr Speaker, we also need to ensure that our PMETs remain employable and constantly upgrade themselves to take on the new jobs of tomorrow. To do so, we must bring training closer in terms of relevance,cost and location.First, we need to make training more relevant to our PMETs. From my weekly visits to workplaces, many PMETs have told me that while they understood the importance of going for training and staying current with industry trends, they are unable to see how going for generic courses can help them in their specific line of work. This is why the NTUC, through its affiliated unions, has initiated the formation of Company Training Committees (CTCs) with our unionised companies. These CTCs are meant to help our workers answer the two common questions of \"Train what?\" and \"Train for what?\" Through the CTCs, we work with companies to assess their specific business and operational needs and translate these needs into a targeted training plan for employees to close the skills gap and at the same time remain employable.In the area ofcost, training must be made more affordable and within the financial reach for our PMETs. In previous Budgets, my fellow Labour MPs and I had called for top-ups to the SkillsFuture Credit and we are glad that this suggestion has been adopted. The top-ups will certainly help our workers offset thecosts of keeping their skill sets relevant. I also support the $500 special top-up to the SkillsFuture Credit accounts for mid-career workers aged 40 to 60.I note, however, that this Special SkillsFuture Credit is limited for use to only about 200 selected career transition programmes. I hope that the Government can expand this to include all Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) courses as well as programmes to help our PMETs to deep-skill themselves. Deep-skill training programmes require a certain level of experience as a pre-requisite and are often morecostly due to their small niche. Perhaps the Government can consider mapping deep-skill training courses to the proficiency levels found in the Skills Framework and allow eligible programmes to be further subsidised. This way, we can help to reduce the out-of-pocket expenses for those who wish to gain a deeper mastery of their profession.Additionally, with our ageing workforce and the corresponding rise in our retirement and re-employment ages, I hope the Government can extend the Special SkillsFuture Credit top-up to those beyond 60 years of age. Just as we should support those who wish to continue working beyond 60, we should also support them in their pursuit of lifelong learning.Like my NTUC colleague, Mr Patrick Tay, I would also urge the Government to bring forward the disbursement of the SkillsFuture Credit top-ups from the current date of 1 October. As the Chinese proverb goes: \"远水救不了近火\". We should disburse the additional SkillsFuture Credit sooner rather than later so that our workers can attend the necessary training during this near-term economic lull and be equipped with new skills and confidence when our respective industries recover.Beyondcost, we need to bring the training programmes physically closer to our mid-career PMETs. Some courses just cannot be done online. For courses that require a physical premise, schools, institutes of higher learning, and even neighbourhood Community Centres (CCs) serve as a more convenient location for our working people to go and upgrade themselves.The Labour Movement will do our part to bring training closer to our working professionals. Here, I would like to announce that our U PME Centre will evolve to a mobile centre and bring our services closer to our PMETs. Currently, the U PME Centre sits at the NTUC Members Hub in One Marina Boulevard, helping to equip PMET union members with a growth mindset through services such as career development workshops and job preparation courses. The existing centre has done well, serving over 1,500 individuals in the past three years. Moving forward, we will bring these workshops and training programmes closer to our PMETs. For a start, U PME Centre will set up on-demand mobile centres at the three CCs located within the Moulmein-Cairnhill constituency at Cairnhill, Tanglin and Pek Kio. I understand the grassroot advisor has been most supportive of this. We will gradually extend our services to all 11 CCs located within the Tanjong Pagar GRC. I hope that the Government can partner with us to progressively open all CCs and even the Residents' Committee (RC) Centres to the mobile U PME Centre so that we, the Labour Movement, can deliver our programmes closer to the heartlands.Mr Speaker, as the pace of technological transformation at the workplace accelerates, employers are increasingly looking to hire and retain candidates with the right set of adaptive skills beyond just technical skills that can enable them to succeed at the workplace. Skills such as project management and communication are becoming more in demand.The Labour Movement will therefore work with our extensive network of professional associations to equip more PMETs with adaptive skills to improve their employment prospects. I am pleased to share that we will be partnering with the Project Management Institute Singapore Chapter (SPMI) to roll out free workshops on project management fundamentals through our new mobile U PME Centre. We will also work with ClickInsight, a digital marketing firm, to provide free digital marketing workshops.NTUC will continue working with our professional associations to expand the range of our adaptive skills training. I urge all PMETs to sign up as an NTUC member to enjoy access to these workshops and to also tap on the yearly $250 union training subsidy, which can be added onto your SkillsFuture Credit top-ups to improve your own employability.Mr Speaker, as the demographics of our working population shifts to become majority PMETs, more emphasis needs to be placed in equipping them with the necessary financial management skills and tools. Many PMETs find themselves \"sandwiched\" financially as they have both young children and elderly parents to care for. It is therefore important that we help them navigate through this period and emerge with sound financial footing so that they can achieve their desired quality of life during retirement.The Labour Movement has been doing our part to support workers in financial planning. MoneyOwl, one of our new social enterprises, was created to offer comprehensive and conflict-free advice to families and help them plan for their retirement needs. Since it was formed in 2018, MoneyOwl has benefited more than 5,000 people. I am happy to share that MoneyOwl has recently launched a comprehensive financial planning service to help Singaporeans plan for retirement and for their children’s educational needs. This tool incorporates the use of the various CPF schemes and provides workers with an analysis of their financial health, including gaps in their insurance protection and investments based on their own individual risk profile.Moving forward, NTUC will partner with the Financial Planning Association of Singapore to run complimentary financial planning workshops for our union members. These workshops will be made available through the mobile U PME Centre to benefit more PMETs and their families.The Labour Movement, through the good work of our social enterprises such as the NTUC Fairprice, will continue to do our part and do our best to help moderate thecost of living in Singapore. Through the Consumer Association of Singapore, we have also launched tools such as Price Kaki and Fuel Kaki to help consumers compare prices of essential household goods, hawker food and fuel. I urge everyone to tap on these resources to get more bang for your buck.Mr Speaker, as the Deputy Prime Minister has rightly pointed out, Singapore’s biggest asset is our exceptional people. COVID-19 can serve as an opportunity amid a public health and economic crisis. I call on employers to use the resources presented at this Budget as a springboard to position your businesses and our workers to ride the waves of recovery. We can also do more to equip our PMETs with the right financial planning skills and help them in their journey towards better retirement adequacy. Together, let us continue investing in our people and ensure that our people remains exceptional.Finally, to all our PMETs, the Labour Movement is aware of your concerns and your anxieties. We have weathered through storms and crisis before and we will do so again. Regardless of whether you are a fresh graduate, in your mid-career, or in your silver years, the Labour Movement will be there for you because for us, every worker matters. Join us and, together, we can and, together, we will turn crisis into opportunity and emerge stronger and more future-ready than before. Mr Speaker, with that, I support the Budget.Mr Speaker: Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon.2.14 pmThe Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon): Mr Speaker, Sir, Budget 2020 is a strategic budget. One that not only addresses short-term concerns of our workers and businesses but also invest in the long-term economic transformation and growth of Singapore. The theme for this year's Budget – \"Advancing as One Singapore\" – reminds us that when we work as one, we can overcome any challenges.Our frontline workers who have been working tirelessly around the clock in our fight against COVID-19 and the many ground-up initiatives and responses from the community rallying behind them embody the strong Singapore spirit that will see us through any challenge.To our doctors, nurses and healthcare workers, our cleaning and security personnel, public officers and all our frontline workers, thank you. Thank you for working tirelessly to keep Singaporeans and Singapore safe through this COVID-19 period.While the impact on COVID-19 is most acutely felt in sectors like retail, tourism and hospitality, the prolonged shutdown of factories in China, has disrupted supply chains around the world and the manufacturing sector here in Singapore is not spared from such an impact. The manufacturing and service sectors are also facing a manpower squeeze as many workers from China are unable to return to Singapore yet for work. This adds extra pressure or our already tight labour market.As the Deputy Secretary-General of NTUC and the Executive Secretary of the Metal Industries Workers' Union, I get feedback from our management partners that for companies with supply chains that are linked to China factories, they have been a reduction in demand of their products by up to about 20%. Some may experience even greater drop in demand. Some manufacturing companies have therefore started to reduce or freeze workers' over-time hours while others are planning for shorter work week, if the situation in China does not improve.While support measures have been extended to sectors such as those that are most immediately affected by COVID-19, I hope that the Government can pay special attention to sectors that may feel the downstream ripple effects of COVID-19, especially if the situation is protracted.Sir, the Stabilisation and Support Package brings relief to the cashflow of companies and helps them cope with the impact of COVID-19 through a combination of rental waivers, tax reliefs and bridging loans. Manpowercosts are also a significant expenditure for companies and the wage support measures that are announced during this period will help companies to \"cutcosts to save jobs\" instead of \"cutting jobs to savecosts\". This is well received by many of my union leaders and workers, who told me that while they are worried about the impact of COVID-19 on their job security, they are thankful that the Jobs Support Scheme and the Wage Credit Scheme will help enterprises retain their workers and protect the jobs that they have. Protecting the jobs of our workers will also allow our companies to retain their critical manpower capabilities, so they can respond swiftly when the DORSCON level normalises and the economy picks up again.During a downturn when the volume of work is reduced, the enhanced Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) and the newly announced SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit can help companies to redesign jobs, upskill their workers and look at long-term business transformation so that when economic recovery occurs, companies will be able to swiftly respond and capture new opportunities. These two points are worth emphasising. The Labour Movement supports the Budget measures in the Stabilisation and Support Package.Our unions have been working closely with their management partners over the last few weeks to see how best they can utilise the downtime to re-skill workers, especially those whose jobs have been impacted by COVID-19. One such example is Copthorne King's Hotel. Working with the Food Drinks and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU), the hotel's General Manager, Mr Kung Teong Wah, saw value in tapping on the Hotel Job Redesign Place-and-Train programme to multi-skill their workers in other job functions so that they can actually be cross-deployed into other departments when there is a shortage of manpower. He even took the initiative to convince General Managers from other hotels within the same group to do likewise in order to avoid asking their workers to go on mandatory annual leave or to take no-pay leave. This is just one of the first-mover from our unionised companies, who is taking the lead to send workers for training during this downturn and I hope that more companies will also seize the opportunity to do so.However, some companies and workers have expressed difficulties navigating the huge number of courses available for skills training and therefore are unsure of how to select the courses appropriate for their needs. They found it difficult to map the type of training to the specific skills in the skills framework that are promulgated by SkillsFuture Singapore and hope that the training they received could be better recognised by employers as well as the industry towards their career progression. There is a need for Government agencies to work with tripartite partners as well as HR practitioners to streamline the approach and make the \"customer journey\" of lifelong learning a much easier one to navigate. This will complement the Government's efforts in providing more SkillsFuture Credits at both the individual and enterprise level.For companies that are keen to train their workers but are unable to find courses due to training gaps currently available in the industry, NTUC LearningHub stands ready to work with companies to bridge the gap and strengthen training in the respective sectors.In coping with COVID-19, many companies have also implemented their Business Continuity Plans or BCPs. Many have split team arrangements to minimise the risks of community spread while ensuring operational continuity. In place of face-to-face meetings or discussions, the teams now meet virtually over their smart phones or laptops. Companies can take this opportunity to help these workers transit and become more digitally confident and at the same time, use this as impetus to accelerate the digital transformation of their business processes. Through the use of technology and job redesign, flexi-work arrangements for certain jobs can indeed be a more permanent arrangement to save on operatingcosts like office rental and utilities while providing the opportunity for employees to remain productive and empowered to manage their time flexibly. This can also meet the needs of many working mothers to balance their childcaring needs and career aspirations while contributing positively to our labour force. So, it is in a crisis where we must make the full use of it to push ourselves to transform even faster.In coping with the near-term challenges brought about by COVID-19, our companies should therefore not forget about the long-term goal of growing and expanding their businesses through deeper industry transformation. The Labor Movement has been advocating for the formation of Company Training Committees (CTCs) to help drive companies' transformation. As shared by NTUC Secretary-General, Mr Ng Chee Meng earlier, to date, we have 352 companies, that have formed CTCs across the various industry clusters.Allow me to share a little bit more about this. NTUC has also, in this process, partnered A*STAR, to train a group of 28 Industry Training Officers (ITOs) to conduct the Operations Technology Roadmapping (OTR) process through the CTCs as a platform in which the process can run. This helps our companies to systematically map out the process of using technology, process change, work re-design and workers' training to turn their strategic business objectives into concrete, tangible, actionable items.Some CTCs have already completed the OTR process and are pushing ahead with their transformation. Let me share an example. Energizer, a unionised company, a household name, under the United Workers of Electronics & Electrical Industries (UWEEI), is one such example. The US-based multinational corporation has over 500 workers in their branch here in Singapore and they were looking to increase their productivity, optimise resources and manpower, as well as upskill their workers. The company embarked on the OTR process in September last year and within a month, completed the entire process. Our Union Leader, Sister Sukartini, who is the Branch Chair of UWEEI in Energizer, was involved in the whole OTR process. Because she was able to give critical inputs about workers' concerns and understanding of the ground situation, this has helped the company's management to identify gaps and blind spots in the roadmap. The OTR process has certainly helped Energizer to identify transformation priorities and action plans. The CTC will be the platform for regular tracking of their transformation objectives.Apart from MNCs, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, the SMEs, are also leveraging the CTC platform and the OTR process to systematically transform their businesses. Fong's Engineering is an SME unionised under the Metal Industries Workers' Union. I have shared in previous Budget speeches before how Fong's has embraced innovation and business model transformation very much early on to help keep themselves ahead of the competition. While having done their own company planning previously, Fong's still chose to undertake the OTR process in November last year. The aim is to re-evaluate the relevance of their previous transformation plans and through this OTR process, Fong's managed to pinpoint some blind spots in their current transformation plan that needed a further in-depth analysis, they identified additional talent and training needs and updated their transformation plan to move even more decisively for the next two years ahead. So, whether you are a MNC or a SME, let me encourage all companies to work with our Labour Movement via the CTC platform to hasten and to deepen your transformation.Through the CTCs, the unions work closely with the companies and relevant agencies in the Government to tap on the various support measures and resources to make the company transformation and the workers' training a reality. The enhanced EDG and the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit announced in this Budget will provide useful funding resources to this tripartite effort to catalyse industry transformation. Mr Speaker, in Mandarin, please.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]With the reduction in workload during this lull period, the Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) as well as the SkillsFuture Enterprise Grant can be used to help companies re-design jobs and enhance the skills of their workers. They can focus on business transformation, respond quickly and seize new opportunities when the economy recovers. In the past few weeks, NTUC and our management partners have been working closely to see how we can make full use of the lull period to upskill workers.Currently, there are many skills upgrading courses in the market. However, with so many different courses to choose from, some companies and workers are at a loss about which courses to pick. They also find it difficult to map the training courses against the skills framework developed by SkillsFuture Singapore, and hope that the training they have undergone will be better recognised by their employers and the industry, and that it will help advance their career. Government ministries and agencies need to work with their tripartite partners and human resource professionals to streamline the matching of courses with the skills framework, and make the “customer experience” of lifelong learning more manageable. This will fit in better with the Government’s efforts to provide more SkillsFuture Credits at the individual and enterprise level.To manage the operational risks of COVID-19, many companies have rolled out business continuity plans, adopted segregated work arrangements and allowed some workers to tele-commute using their laptops. Companies can make use of this opportunity to build digital confidence amongst employees and accelerate the digital transformation of their business operations. Flexible work arrangements for certain job functions could also be made permanent. This will not only help companies save on operationalcosts like office rentals and utilities, but also help many working parents better balance work demands and parental duties, which will encourage more to contribute to our workforce. I hope that companies and workers will ride on the momentum driven by this crisis to deepen and accelerate the pace of transformation.The Labour Movement is committed to partner with the Government and employers to work towards a brighter future for Singapore.(In English):Mr Speaker, this year's Budget builds on the previous year's efforts to upskill our workforce and transform our industries while providing crucial help for our workers, our enterprises and our economy to get through the challenges posed by COVID-19. The Labour Movement stands ready to work with the Government and our employers to Advance as One Singapore and build a stronger and better future for Singapore. I support this Budget.2.30 pmMr Arasu Duraisamy (Nominated Member): Mr Speaker, Budget 2020, as announced by Minister for Finance, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, is both responsive and forward-thinking, amid the on-going COVID-19 outbreak and a slowing economy. The Budget reflects the values and priorities of our citizens and charts the direction to deploy our limited financial resources to meet our nation's goals and objectives. A substantial budget amount has been put aside for Health, Education and measures that address climate change. Rightly so and I welcome these moves.The Deputy Prime Minister spoke on another critical aspect of the Budget that is of importance to the workers of Singapore. That is on transforming our industries and workforce. Let me pause here to declare my interest as a unionist and a representative of the Labour Movement in Singapore.Singapore went through a major industrial transformation in the 1970s and the government of the day then stepped up training of the workforce to handle new jobs that came into Singapore. Fifty years have gone by and we now at the crossroads of change. Our economy while fundamentally strong has slowed down tremendously with an overall growth of just 0.7% in 2019. With global trade slowdown and growing uncertainties, MTI has downgraded Singapore's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to be around -0.5% to 1.5% for 2020.To deal with the immediate challenge, the proposed Stabilising and Support Package under Budget 2020 will help enterprises with wagecost and cash flow pressures as they grapple with the current economic slowdown. At the same time, it will help our workers to stay in their jobs and to go for skills upgrading.I applaud the Jobs Support Scheme, which aims to ensure that our workers stay employed by supporting companies defray their wagecost. It will offset 8% of a Singaporean worker's wage, capped at $3600. It is estimated to benefit 1.9 million workers.But may I seek clarification from the Minister as to the reasons for the short duration of the support? What happens, God forbid, if the COVID-19 outbreak stays around longer? Also, companies do need time to adjust even after COVID-19 is over. Will the Government consider extending the support? How do we ensure that companies that benefited from these subsidies will not let go of their workers after the support ends?Yesterday, MOM announced the introduction of a temporary scheme to help the manufacturing and service sectors manage their manpower needs. MOM will allow businesses in these sectors with excess foreign workforce to transfer their workers to companies with manpower shortage. While I support the move, can the Government go further and consider reducing foreign worker levies for firms affected by COVID-19, similar to what was in place during the 2003 SARS period?Under the Transformation and Growth strategy, there are three key thrusts, of which developing our people is one. This aims to enable our citizens to get better jobs, better wages and to stay employable. The new SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit and the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package aim to do that. It is a welcome move as both companies and workers benefit. It will encourage the companies to send their workers for training and skills upgrading and at the same time, workers will benefit in terms of their employability.My main concern is the implementation of these schemes.In many sectors, a portion of workers' monthly pay comprises of variables such as operational incentives, over-time or shift allowances. Workers will have to forego these variable payments to attend training to undertake new or additional roles. In some cases, these variables can be as high as one third of their monthly gross pay, if not more.The Labour Movement calls on employers not to shortchange employees and to share the productivity gains fairly while recognising workers who support the company transformation through skills upgrading, at the expense of undertaking short-term pay reduction. This gesture will strengthen the trust between employers and their workers while ensuring the workforce is well-equipped and future-ready.At the last National Day Rally, the Prime Minister announced raising the retirement age to 65 and re-employment age to 70 in phases by the end of the decade.The Labour Movement has since then called on companies to move forward the implementation date before the law comes into place. Unfortunately, many are reluctant, citingcost as a significant factor.I am happy to hear of the introduction of the Senior Worker Support Package. The Labour Movement hopes there is less of an excuse now to hold back but to move forward to our call.The Senior Employment Credit and the Senior Workers Early Adopter Grant, together with the CPF Transition Offset, will help companies manage the overall wagecost. I urge employers to not view these workers ascost burden but as valuable assets with tacit knowledge, for these senior employees will be the ones mentoring the next generation of workers.On that note, there are some groups of senior employees that the companies are reluctant to extend their retirement and re-employment age. They are mainly the general administrative staff who are easily replaceable with younger employees as their wagecost is lower and with employees in specific roles where physical fitness is a requirement.Technologies such as robotic process automation, or commonly known as RPA, execute repetitive business processes cheaper, faster and without human errors. As such technologies become more pervasive in workplaces, office-based generalist staff become vulnerable and face more reduced opportunities for re-employment when they retire.The Labour Movement calls on employers to intervene early through career planning customised to individual employees' needs and profiles. The companies can consider re-skilling them in their 40s to achieve better job security and job progression when they retire and seek re-employment in the company.An example of a forward-thinking company is PSA. It has taken active steps to embark on upskilling and re-skilling its employees through job redesign. The more matured workers are given similar opportunities and encouraged to upgrade their skills and to adopt technologies so that they continue to contribute productively. For example, PSA currently offers alternative employment for personnel from the Emergency Response Team, or the ER Team, upon retirement at the age of 55 years old. Working with the union, PSA is encouraging the ER personnel to transit early in their 40s so that they have a longer runway in a new career path while they are in a better position to make the transition.This re-skilling reframes one's mindset and gets them prepared for the change. It takes two hands to clap. While employers do their part, employees themselves need to embrace the culture of continuous upskilling and re-skilling.In conclusion Mr Speaker, in his Budget speech, the Deputy Prime Minister spoke on the importance of the short-term measures to deal with the immediate challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak and economic uncertainties while planning for the long term on growing our economy and creating opportunities for our people. Budget 2020 is a step in the right direction.The Deputy Prime Minister's call resonates with the Labour Movement. Our call is the Government's call. Every worker matters. The time is now to take action and walk the talk. I rise in support of the Budget.Mr Speaker: Mr Zainal Sapari.2.38 pmMr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol): Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Budget. This year’s Budget intends to mitigate the short-term vulnerabilities faced by businesses and workers without taking our eyes off the future. The Budget has addressed these vulnerabilities due to COVID-19 through various schemes such as the Jobs Support Scheme, tax rebates, bridging loans, rental waivers and many others. I would like to urge companies to translate these savings into saving jobs and reducing workers' vulnerability due to COVID-19.In the medium and long-term horizon, the rapidly changing job market and business models can leave many workers behind if they are unprepared. The vulnerability of workers can manifest itself in the form of stagnating wages, job insecurity, skill redundancies and poor working conditions, among many others. While the Budget can help mitigate these vulnerabilities, a concerted effort by the tripartite partners and a mindset change in our society is still needed to alleviate some of these vulnerabilities because every worker matters and every job counts.There are workers providing essential services that are very susceptible to low and stagnating wages and poor working conditions due to the business nature of their industry characterized by competitive biddings and under-cutting.In terms of mitigating workers' vulnerability due to low and stagnating wages, it is undeniable that the tripartite partners have done a lot to help our workers in the outsourced industries such as cleaning, security and landscape. Given that the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) has shown its effectiveness to help improve workers' skills and wages, I urge the Government to support industry stakeholders if they are keen to adopt PWM so that more workers can enjoy better wages coupled with better skills and increased productivity. Sectors like waste collection and strata management are keen to have a mandatory PWM and it is important to have Government support to identify and leverage on the key levers that would encourage widespread adoption.Lack of knowledge on what constitutes fair wages can also increase workers' vulnerability. Given that wage data are collected in the annual Occupational Wage Survey, we can help these workers by having a wage benchmark by occupation and sector so that workers can identify a fair wage for their occupation and be more aware of the industry standard to make informed decisions about their careers. Perhaps, as a trial to set industry wage benchmark, the tripartite partners could start with the F&B industry where there are around 180,000 workers in diverse roles.I also welcome the Enabling Employment Credit that was announced in the Budget to provide wage offsets to companies hiring Singaporeans with disabilities. There are many with disabilities who are working or would like to seek employment. However, it may not be easy for them to work in a building where the physical structure may pose a big hindrance or for them to find companies that offer employment to people with disabilities. In this aspect, I would like to call for the Government to consider providing funding support to help employers offset thecosts needed to modify infrastructure at workplaces, especially in older buildings, to encourage employment of people with disabilities. The various job portals such as MyCareersFuture.sg or the National Jobs Bank should indicate positions that welcome persons with disabilities. All these measures would promote a more inclusive workforce because every worker matters and every job counts.Workers are also vulnerable if employers cannot pay their wages because the company has ceased operations. While these workers can lodge their salary claims with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM), in most cases, their salaries cannot be recovered once the company has ceased operations.We need to do more to protect our workers from failed businesses. Currently, there is a short-term relief fund administered by the NTUC U Care Centre to help low-wage workers who are owed salaries because their companies have ceased operations. I would like to call for the fund to be extended to help more workers beyond low-wage workers. Many of these workers who are owed salaries are sole breadwinners and for them and their families, the hardship is real and painful. All workers deserve to have their rice bowl protected and we must continue to explore ways to help and protect more workers.Workers can also become vulnerable due to unfair employment contracts. Some employers have included in employment contracts certain clauses that may not be fair to the workers, perhaps to address staff attrition, recoup losses that they incur due to liquidated damages or protect their business interests. Regardless, including unfair clauses is unethical and they abuse the vulnerable position the workers might be in.There needs to be greater engagement to help workers understand employment contracts and this outreach could start in our tertiary institutions. In addition, MOM would also want to consider a \"cooling off period\", perhaps up to five working days, that will allow workers to rescind the contract they have signed, without penalty. MOM may also want to consider starting a watchlist if companies are found or reported to have unfair clauses in their employment contracts. Administrative penalties should be imposed on companies on this watchlist.Tripartite partners must also work together to ensure that all Singaporeans can work with dignity. A tripartite advisory on the provision of rest areas for outsourced workers has been released to act as a guide for service buyers and service providers in providing proper rest areas for outsourced workers. We would like to call on the Government to provide incentives to urge more building owners to provide rest areas for their outsourced workers.Perhaps a tipping point that the Government can seriously consider to encourage a higher take-up rate is to allow for rest areas not to be counted as part of the Gross Floor Area (GFA) of a building as the area is usually an unused space or has little commercial value. This would help many building owners that have already maxed out their GFA to provide a rest area without penalty. Mr Speaker, in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]I welcome all the various top-ups to SkillsFuture and I am especially heartened by the special attention given to mature workers through the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package to help them undergo upskilling and reskilling. While Government has given hiring incentives for employers to hire local mature workers, the efforts to enlighten employers to have a truly inclusive workforce must continue. In addition, we should also consider administrative penalties if employers are guilty with age discriminatory practices.I am also equally heartened with the Senior Worker Support Package for older workers to reduce their employment vulnerability. This package will give our older workers greater assurance that they can continue working if they want to. This is a good opportunity for companies to tap on the Senior Worker Early Adopter Grant to raise their retirement and re-employment ages ahead of legislative changes. Regardless of one’s age group, every worker matters and every job counts.(In English): Every Budget must provide funding and resources to help workers reduce their vulnerabilities. We need to work together to reduce workers' vulnerabilities and to show we care for the workers. While I call upon employers to uphold their responsibilities to their workers and to do more for their welfare and well-being, I would also like to remind workers all my fellow workers to take charge of their career development and be future-ready. All of us have a part to play in creating an inclusive and caring society where every worker matters and every job counts. I support the Budget.2.47 pmMr Desmond Choo (Tampines): Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate. Budget 2020 is empathetic and bold. Measures such as the Job Support Scheme and the Wage Credit Scheme will reassure workers that the Government is helping to secure jobs. Amidst the immediate needs to mitigate against the adverse impact of COVID-19 outbreak, it is easy to lose sight of our longer term imperatives. It is understandable as immediate survival is key. I would like to ask the Minister how do we continue to grow our economy and create good jobs for all Singaporeans even as we battle the outbreak? This outbreak has also highlighted the problems of being dependent on a large economy or being inter-connected with multiple economies. Do we now need to re-examine our strategies and adjust course, rather than doing more of the same?With its obvious focus on the COVID-19 economic fall-out, how are we still ensuring that we are funding our social strategies in education, healthcare and housing to ensure equal opportunities for all? It is critical that we need to stay true to what has made Singapore successful – equal opportunities for all Singaporeans.Being a comprehensive Budget, it would almost be nit-picking to find gaps. I would like to find some time on three other issues: needs of the self-employed persons, unmet needs of the younger workforce and the longer term workforce gender disparity issue.The COVID-19 outbreak highlights the precarious situation of Self-Employed Persons (SEPs). Many SEPs were and still are adversely affected – not only those in hospitality-related industries but also those in the creative, events, sporting, outdoor learning and transport industries. Budget 2020 will help SEPs as every Singaporean 21 years old and above will get cash support, SkillsFuture Credit and targeted support for tourism-related industries.But most of the Budget 2020 measures are channelled through companies, and our SEPs might not be helped. They also have limited medical and training support except those provided via SkillsFuture.Those dependent on platforms such as Grab food delivery riders have an imbalance of bargaining powers. We often hear of adjustments to incentive structures unilaterally without consultation with the SEPs. This would probably not have happened or to a lesser extent, in a typical employer-employee structure.The way forward is not one of absolute parity with traditional employees – SEPs do treasure the flexibility of contract work. Thus, there must be some trade-offs. It is one of having better balance of bargaining powers, especially for those working with larger entities such as the platform companies.There are two possible approaches. One, to allow for greater union representation. And two, to classify SEPs, within a limited definition, especially the platform workers, as workers defined by the Employment Act. Both of these approaches are not without their limitation but it certainly betters the lot of the SEPs. Their ranks will certainly increase over time. I hope that the Ministry can also consider providing greater support for the SEPs in the second phase of COVID-19 support, if ever one is needed.Next, on the unmet needs of the younger workforce. Our Young NTUC survey showed that younger Singaporeans are keen to develop themselves overseas. The Asia Ready Exposure Programme in Budget 2020 would greatly help our students to pick up those valuable experiences while still in school.We also hope that young Singaporeans in their first or second career can also have such opportunities. Especially those in the early 20s, there is still sufficient runway for an internship. However, the resources available to them are limited. Those Singaporeans who have graduated are dependent on their companies for overseas exposure. Can Government provide a one stop centre, and perhaps subsidies for younger Singaporeans to explore careers in Asia, especially South East Asia?Next, let me discuss on the gender wage gap. It is not a common Budget debate topic. But first, it is an important issue and second, there are opportunities afforded from COVID-19 outbreak. MOM did a study not too long ago and found that women in Singapore are earning less than men today and that gap has grown slightly from 16% in 2002 to 16.3% in 2018. The adjusted gender pay gap was 6% in 2018.  The main adjustment was for occupational differences. Yet, it still runs counter to the principle that all things being equal, men and women must obtain the same pay if they are doing the same job with similar outcomes.We acknowledge that there has been progress. And we also acknowledge that absolute gender parity in job outcomes is not necessarily a normative ideal. But there is immense value to pursue the economic outcomes of greater equality, besides addressing the social issues and the values that we engender as a nation.Indeed, there are benefits for greater women participation at all levels. In an IMF blog piece by Christine Lagarde and Johnathan Ostry on 28 November 2018, their conclusion was gender diversity matters. I quote, \"Our analysis springs from the observation – supported by considerable microeconomic evidence – that women and men bring different skills and perspectives to the workplace, including different attitudes to risk and collaboration. Studies have also shown that the financial performance of firms improves with more gender-equal corporate boards…. our evidence – from macroeconomic, sectoral, and firm-level data – shows that women and men complement each other in the production process, creating an additional benefit from increasing women's employment on growth.\" Therefore, the key benefits from narrowing gender wage gaps are: first, a bigger boost to growth; second, higher productivity; and third, a more equal and inclusive society.There are structural issues to tackle: first, human resources – and how we grade women who are out on maternity. A working mother would be entitled to up to 16 weeks of Government-Paid Maternity Leave. But oftentimes, in some organisations, they might be graded on the same 12 months as any other colleagues. This meant that from a work output perspective, the women on maternity are already at a disadvantage. Companies would argue that it would only be fair to the other colleagues who picked up the slack. But this also meant that good talent on maternity would not be given a level playing field to progress as progression are usually based on consistency of better graded performances. This has perhaps contributed to a lack of women in senior leadership positions over time.Second, we see a persistent lack of women at the top leadership positions. Perhaps having a more diverse leadership might provide for better gender-neutral policies.Third, some women decide to leave the workforce entirely because of a lack of supportive workplace measures such as Flexible Work Arrangements. Currently, only 47% of firms in Singapore offer full-time flexible work arrangements, according to a McKinsey report.Women are still often expected to take on the primary role at home. The responsibility of care-giving and housework also continue to disproportionately affect women, who find themselves taking on the double shift of working a job and taking on most of the household responsibilities. This added burden of care-giving might have resulted in 83.4% of married men being employed in 2017 compared to 63.3% of married women in the same period of time.So, what can be done? I would like to offer a few suggestions.First, women should be given the right to flexi-work arrangements (FWA) post-maternity. Normalising flexible work arrangement options to give a degree of comfort to working women, as it helps working care-givers avoid the conflict they face in trying to balance their careers with responsibilities at home something especially accentuated post-maternity. It can be very difficult to ask a woman to ask for FWA if it is seen as a privilege and not a norm. COVID-19 outbreak has clearly shown that organisations can and are able to operate with broad FWA, even as we speak now. Previously, the argument was it was not possible.Second, companies should grade women on maternity on an eight-month basis rather than a 12-month basis. Planning from the start meant that women will still be able to have a more level promotion path after maternity.Third, key leadership positions in our listed companies ought to be tracked and monitored to ensure that women are not being grossly under-represented. Company-wide reviews can be done consistently. Citigroup, for example has adjusted the pay in Singapore of women who earned less than their male peers for doing the same job. We all need to lean in to create a more inclusive environment for women.Budget 2020 is bold and comprehensive. It tackles the immediate challenges head-on without losing sight of the future transformation needs. No Budget is expected to address all issues which is why we must also view each Budget as part of a larger whole. It is a longer financial plan after all.The COVID-19 episode requires significant shift of resources but it is necessary. COVID-19 will also eventually come to pass if we are united. And we must be ready when the upturn opportunities present themselves. Notwithstanding my earlier suggestions, I support the Motion.2.57 pmMr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio): Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.] The sudden onset of COVID-19 has dealt a serious blow to our economy. Not knowing how long this epidemic will last, many Singaporeans are worried that their livelihood will be seriously affected and they might lose their jobs.Nevertheless, with the previous experience of fighting SARS, most Singaporeans were not panicky when COVID-19 struck. On the contrary, we could face this challenge calmly. The greatest test is not whether we are able to stock up groceries or whether we can adopt healthier habits, but whether we are able to display confidence and a cooperative spirit to fight this disease.Undoubtedly, self-preservation can only ensure that we and our families are protected temporarily, but in the long run, it will not protect our national economy, companies or job situation. To deal with the impact of COVID-19, we need to work together and make full use of the government measures provided in the Budget.Let me give you an example.Over the past one month, many taxi drivers and private hire drivers told me that the point-to-point (PTP) transport service industry has been badly affected. With the significant decrease in customers, their incomes have plunged and many drivers have decided to stop driving. Fortunately, most drivers are still working as usual. They do not complain but hope that there will be adequate solutions or packages to help them tide over this period.On normal days, there is already intense competition between taxi drivers and private hire drivers. Fortunately, when COVID-19 hit us, the tripartite partners consisting of unions, the Government and employers worked together like \"plywood\". Plywood can take on much heavier loads than an individual layer of wood. Each layer of plywood may be made of different materials and differ in terms of quality, but when binded together as plywood, the effect is very significant.The spread of COVID-19 has brought about stern challenges. Although we cannot proclaim to have solved every problem easily, at least we have been able to come up with measures as the situation evolved. During the initial stage, unions took the initiative to understand the concerns of our taxi-drivers, and most drivers expressed hope that they can drive their cars safely but said they lacked protective supplies like hand sanitisers and disinfectants. Since then, unions have tried their best to procure these necessities for drivers through various channels and distributed the supplies to them.The Government and operators have also provided necessary resources and helped drivers to monitor their body temperature, so as to give customers peace of mind. We have also used our funds to help drivers who had to stop driving due to quarantine orders, so that they can tide over this difficult period. The timely launch of the $77million assistance package by the Government and operators is also an initiative to assist taxi drivers and private hire drivers as soon as possible.Hence, workers from the PTP transport sector are able to receive help from the Government and operators with swift and targeted measures. Only with this \"plywood\" cooperative spirit, are we able to help workers keep their jobs and keep companies going. This is what job security means.Only a strong enterprise, a resilient labour force, a thoughtful and efficient union, and a nation with wit and resources can ensure the job security of Singaporeans. Job security means that the economy, companies and workers must receive appropriate support, and establish close partnerships where everyone works to help one another.As we know, a lot of things are easier said than done.Our tripartite partners have been working together to stabilise the economy, while continuing to help transform industries and assist workers in training, so that they can upgrade their skills, keep their jobs and tide over this difficult time. During this period, I witnessed how taxi-drivers and private hire drivers turn from competitors to cooperative partners. They volunteer to distribute masks and hand sanitisers to colleagues and help them to do temperature checks. Although there has been talk that frontline healthcare workers are being discriminated by members of the public, many of our taxi-drivers have volunteered to ferry healthcare workers to and from work.All of us have chosen to help each other in this crisis period and to weather the storm together. Each party has put aside their different views and corporate brand names, with the single objective of consolidating the economy and development of Singapore. Once again, I would like to thank the Finance Minister for giving a booster shot to the PTP transport industry. Our tour guides have also just received help from the Government, and the tripartite partners are working to assist them.On behalf of the unions, I would like to urge the Government again to roll out more measures to help freelance workers. I have reached out to several freelancers to understand their situation and discuss ways to help them. They include sports coaches, instructors, technicians, performers and photographers, and so on. Their income have plunged due to the decrease in customer. I hope that the Government ministries can take the lead and work with industry players to think of ways to help them reducecost and expand customer base. Some of these freelancers would like to go for training during this lull period, but are deterred as this would mean a loss of income, so they are also feeling a little helpless.However, I believe that with the joint efforts by the tripartite partners, we can ensure that all the top talents in the various industries will be able to keep their jobs, and make use of their talents to enhance Singapore’s competitiveness when the crisis is over.In fact, some taxi drivers have urged me to organise an activity for everyone to eat beehoon together. Some Hokkien taxi drivers joked that we will \"wun wun jia beehoon\" (eat beehoon calmly). So, I hope that we can be strong and steady, and not be overly worried.Although the impact of COVID-19 may not blow over in the short term, the Government will continue to support the economy, companies, workers and families. We must remain confident, maintain healthy lifestyles, lead normal lives and try to revive our tourism industry, this is the greatest help that we can give to all our industries and all our workers.Let us work together and show determination in adversity.Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Budget.Mr Speaker: Senior Minister of State Heng Chee How.3.04 pmThe Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How): Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join the debate on this year's Budget.At Budget debate 2018, I called for tripartite discussions to determine the new longer term retirement and re-employment ages. At last year's Budget debate, I expressed hope that the Tripartite Workgroup formed by MOM in May 2018 to negotiate higher retirement and re-employment ages and enhanced CPF contribution rates would soon come to a win-win outcome so that older workers would have added confidence about their employment and retirement savings. As Singapore's population is ageing, progress in these areas is necessary and important to help sustain the added years.Prime Minister Lee announced at last year's National Day Rally the consensus reached by the tripartite partners to raise retirement age progressively from 62 to 65 and the re-employment age ceiling from 67 to 70 over the course of a decade. Specific first moves were also announced, namely, to raise retirement age from 62 to 63 and the re-employment age ceiling from 67 to 68 in 2022. And one year before that, in 2021, first steps will be taken to raise the CPF contribution rates for workers aged 55 and older.The agreement that we reached shows the strength of our tripartism to tackle real and serious issues. It also showed the Government's commitment toward looking after the interests of our older workers.So, on behalf of older workers, I thank the Government and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) for working hand in hand with NTUC to achieve these win-win outcomes.A year has passed and we are now in Budget debate 2020. How fast things have . Since January this year, the Singapore economy has been buffeted by the negative disruptive effects of the COVID-19 virus outbreak internationally even as the downsides of the US-China trade war continue to slow global trade and growth.Against this background, Singapore's growth forecast has been revised downwards significantly, from between 0.5% and 2.5% that was estimated in November last year, to between -0.5% and 1.5% in February this year. So, within these months, it was the revised downwards significantly.On the ground, these changes in projections reflect falling demand, supply chain and manpower disruptions, as well ascost, credit and cashflow pressures and worries for companies. And these worries for companies in turn translate into worker concerns over loss of over-time and other forms of income, wage freezes and even cuts, and increasing anxiety over the security of their jobs.Older workers, both executives and non-executives, feel vulnerable in this environment. They are afraid that in any industry or company shakeout, they may bear the brunt. They are also worried that if they are displaced from their jobs, it would be more difficult for them to find new work or to expect to maintain anything near their original pay levels. And if that happens, then it would erode the progress of prior efforts to strengthen the sustainability of our ageing population over the long run.Older workers therefore look to the Government and to this Budget for reassurance. They hope to see and they want to trust that this Government will continue to have their backs and would lean forward to safeguard their interests and ensure that they are fairly treated. The Labour Movement hears their concerns and have lobbied hard on their behalf with Government.This Budget, Mr Speaker, has given older workers that reassurance. And I thank the Government for understanding the worker's needs and worries, and for addressing our older workers' concerns.I would like to highlight specifics in the Budget to make my point.Consider the announced CPF contribution rates improvements meant for 2021. The worry, as expressed by older workers is that, given the headwinds and the difficult economic environment that we are facing now, they worry whether the Government would now decide to postpone or cancel those improvements. And so, when they heard the Budget, they heard that the Government has instead stepped forward to help defray thecost pressure on employers that those improved CPF rates would bring. In other words, what the Government has promised to older workers in this improved CPF rates in 2021 will be done. This is the Government keeping its word to our older workers.But workers then worry that if they should lose their jobs in the meantime, or cannot find a new one if they are displaced, then improved CPF rates or for that matter, raised retirement and employment ages, will be moot. Hereto, the Budget have measures aimed at lowering such risks for older workers.Under the Stabilisation and Support Package, the Government will introduce a Jobs Support Scheme. This Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) will help enterprises retain their local employees during this period of uncertainty. Employers will receive a 8% cash grant on the gross monthly wages of each local employee for the months of October 2019 to December 2019, subject to a monthly wage cap of $3,600 per employee. And this is on top of the Special Employment Credits and the Additional Special Employment Credits previously introduced to incentive the hiring of older workers. These two incentives, we were told, will then be combined and restructured into a new Seniors Employment Credit Scheme.The Government will also enhance the Wage Credit Scheme to further help shoulder thecost of wage increases for workers. These moves make each existing employee lesscostly to their companies and therefore lower their overall risk of retrenchment, or will help companies hold off retrenchment for as long as possible.For older workers who are displaced, there will be a hiring incentive for employers who hire local jobseekers aged 40 and above through a re-skilling programme. For each eligible worker, the Government will provide a 20% salary support to the employer for six months, capped at $6,000 a month.There is even another incentive for employers who are prepared to hire older workers on a part-time basis. This will help make older workers who are unable to work full-time morecost-effective for employers to consider hiring.By the sheer number of targeted subsidies and incentives aimed at sustaining and spurring continued hiring of older Singaporean workers in this Budget, the Government's care for and commitment to our older workers is crystal clear. And our older workers appreciate this.While keeping one's job or being able to get back into one quickly in the event of retrenchment are of immediate concern in the current economic climate, our older workers also know that their longer term employment and employability really depend on whether they can keep up and adapt with the changing technology and business models and methods.Here, they look to the Government and the tripartite partners to do more to help them stay skilled and relevant to the changing times and requirements.The Government is certainly doing its part to energise skills building for the benefit of workers and companies in this Budget.In terms of enabling skills building through funding, the Government is introducing the next bound of SkillsFuture through this Budget. There will be more money given to individuals and companies to undertake training via SkillsFuture. There will be a second top-up of $500 to the SkillsFuture accounts of all Singaporeans aged 25 and above, while middle-age workers will get an additional $500. There will also be a new SkillsFuture Enterprise grant to defray up to 90% of companies' business transformation, training and job redesigncosts. These incentives, together with substantial existing grants and subsidies from Enterprise Singapore, Workforce Singapore and other economic agencies, again goes to show the Government's firm belief in enabling individual and corporate investment in building skills and capabilities for greater competitiveness and in enhancing the employment and employability of our workers.On the Labour Movement's part, as elaborated by my fellow Labour Member of Parliament colleagues earlier, we introduced last year the Company Training Committees (CTCs) as platforms to bring companies and unions into partnership over skills building, and to inject Government resources and support for such initiatives through this channel and platform. This is a practical way to proactively and systematically upgrade companies' and workers' capabilities, and to help build momentum for the overall transformation of Singapore's economy.Good progress has been made in this area, and again, as reported earlier, 352 CTCs have already been formed since its inception in April last year. Provisions of this year's Budget can certainly give a boost to the CTCs' efforts, and I urge our tripartite partners to make full use of these resources to press ahead with investing in our workers' training, across all ages.For displaced workers, finding a new job quickly is important. This is especially so for older workers as experience tells us that they will find it more difficult to find a new job and to maintain the previous pay. And this affects not only what we might traditionally call rank-and-file workers, but actually, it is so for all levels and all ages of workers, affecting also middle-age PMEs.In this Budget, through the SkillsFuture Mid-career Support Package, the Government is going to double the job placement of professionals via the Professional Conversion Programmes or PCPs. Such professionals will be able to find new career runways through the PCPs' skill-up-and-switch roadmaps. I fully support this, and I have one call on the Government to consider, which is to broaden the age criterion – currently set between 40 and 60 years old – to include those up to the current re-employment age ceiling of 67. And the reason is because all the factors that we have argued about, the 40 to 60 year olds having the vulnerability, they would certainly also apply from 60 to 67 years old. And indeed if anything, if that group should lose their jobs, I think the challenges will not be less than those aged 40 to 60. As the same time, the scheme itself has certain safeguards in terms of useful courses. So, I think it is good and proper that we broaden the criteria to include workers up to the re-employment age ceiling of 67 and to continue in this way to show the Government's commitment towards their employment, employability and welfare.In this area of boosting job search and placement, the Government will find an enthusiastic innovator in the Labour Movement. As Minister in the Prime Minister's office and Secretary-General of NTUC, brother Ng Chee Meng had said earlier, NTUC will be spearheading the Job Security Council (JSC) in partnership with industry to go beyond what, for example, NTUC's e2i has traditionally done for individual job seekers and individual hiring companies.Through proactive information sharing and planning, JSCs and CTCs can work together to efficiently facilitate training, re-training and placements between manpower-flushed areas and manpower-starved areas. Such system-level efficiency in manpower re-deployment will further sharpen Singapore's overall competitiveness that is good for business and it would certainly help shorten periods of unemployment for workers who are seeking new jobs.Sir, as the saying goes, \"When the going gets tough, the tough gets going\". We have to face down both the immediate COVID-19 threat as well as shape up for the big challenges and opportunities that the future economy will bring. I heard our Deputy Prime Minister over the radio, as he was discussing aspects of the Budget and exhorting everybody to keep our spirits up and together do our best, he quoted the name of a Hokkien song title. He said, “要 拼 才 会 赢”, which means in English, success comes through effort and striving. He is absolutely right. Success will not come from just taking painkillers or hunkering down. It will come from taking action – concrete, purposeful, effective action.The Labour Movement stands ready to work with Government and employers to tackle this tough patch and to simultaneously build that better future of better wages, welfare and work prospects for all workers. Because Every Worker Matters, now and always. Sir, I support this Unity Budget.3.20 pmProf Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar): Mr Speaker Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate. Sir, the Budget proposed has been characterised as having something for everyone.It consists of two parts, one dealing with the effects of the COVID-19 crisis meant to stabilise the economy and support those affected by the current crisis and a second component designed to help our country continue to grow over the longer term. It supports a range of short-term measures to help tide over the current crisis and a broad sweep of longer term measures to ensure that the economy continues to grow over the long term and that our people can enjoy an increasing quality of life.Among the proposed measures which for me deserves special mention are increasing the Budget for CSA to embark on new capabilities needed to protect our IT systems against increasingly sophisticated attacks, removing the internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040 and replacing them with electric vehicles and measures to mitigate the effects of climate change. All these resonate with me, not just because they are important issues affecting the future of our country but also because I have always believed that we as a nation can take the global lead in these issues. Sir, I also welcomed the delay in increasing the GST rate by one year.Sir, despite the COVID-19 crisis, we must have one eye on the future. We cannot afford to be distracted from discussing the real challenges facing our country. It is also important that we learn from this experience and put in place changes and preparations that can help us face the next crisis. Our response to the SARS episode in 2003 and subsequent changes we made to prepare for the next crisis have stood us well in this instance.Our Government has responded decisively to the crisis. As a people, we have shown both the good and not so good behaviour during this challenging time. The rush for food items and sundry items such as toilet paper when the DORSCON level was changed from Yellow to Orange, reflected not only anxiety but also an irrational response that brought out the worst of Singaporeans. My thanks to all the staff of the various supermarkets and outlets for showing immense patience and fortitude during this period.Several self-initiated efforts have emerged to rally support for our frontline workers. Youth groups, religious and community organisations, civil society groups and several selfless individuals are all coming together to play their part in this effort. These and other examples of selfless Singaporeans stepping forward to do what they can to deal with this crisis are instances that should give us hope that there is the better side of us waiting to come out especially when the need arises.Many have also adjusted to a new normal of washing our hands regularly, staying away from crowded places, wearing a mask if we are unwell and spending time with loved ones in parks and beaches enjoying the fresh air and breeze prevalent this time of the year. Sir, if out of this crisis our hygiene standards are raised and as a people we become more conscious of keeping Singapore clean, then we would not have wasted the lessons of this crisis.Some have also adjusted to working in different teams at different times and locations such as their homes and meeting only if necessary. And I am told by a friend that because of some working from home, Raffles Place is a lot quieter and cleaner. Congestion in the morning seems to have eased a bit. If we make this change permanent, would our quality of life not improve? For those with young children in school, being at home on a working day can indeed be helpful.Sir, I am sure we can work out the gains and losses so that we understand the impact this change may have on our country. Likewise, conducting classes online has become a part of the new normal. Coming from an Institution of Higher Learning, I am all for online learning to be one of the features of our IHLs. IHLs can decide on the balance among the various classes. Online learning will release classrooms for other needs. Clearly, interaction between students and staff must continue albeit for those that really warrant it such as tutorials, project discussions and lab works.Sir, I have full confidence in the Ministerial team in not only dealing with this crisis but also in learning from it valuable lessons that will help us prepare for the next crisis. So, let us work together with the team and other Singaporeans in seeing the end of this current crisis as soon as possible. I am sure Ministers Gan and Wong are both looking forward to a good night's sleep and perhaps a round of golf when all this is over. I look forward to meeting them at the greens.Sir, there is an issue that I think deserves some discussion. The rush to stock up food items over that fateful weekend reminds us that getting communications right is very important. During SARS, there was no social media. Today, we are inundated by news of all sorts from various platforms and from friends and strangers alike. The fundamental question is whether we trust the Government in telling us what is the right thing to do especially during a crisis. Rumours and misinformation about lack of supplies helped to fuel senseless hoarding. This shows a lack of trust. Chaos could have broken out leading to unimaginable losses. This is something we all do not want to happen in Singapore.Another issue of trust currently being debated is POFMA as some view this as an attempt to stifle dissent on the Internet. There is a sense among them that the Government is using this legislation for its own agenda rather than serving the needs of our people.I am all too familiar with this kind of concern. When I moved to license online news sites in 2013, several Internet groups alleged that this move would kill the diversity of voices on the Internet. As it turns out, the licensing scheme did not stifle the Internet at all. Many groups continue to flourish on the Internet. All we wanted, and I am sure all of us can agree to this, is responsible behavior on the Internet, especially when the issues affect the lives of so many Singaporeans.Sir, going forward, this issue of trust will continue to arise as we grapple with increasingly complex issues. Consider the effects of climate change on our small island. It is a long-term issue which requires us to put in place the solutions now. It means spending valuable state resources on matters which will affect future generations but does not bring immediate benefits. At the same time, if other countries do not put in place their own mitigation measures, climatic changes can affect us. Hence, dealing with the effects of climate change will raise many questions about how the Government should best use our limited fiscal resources for the good of our country. And the Government will need to build trust that it is doing what is right for our people, even though it means spending significant resources over a very long-term period to benefit future generations.Sir, consider our efforts at digitalising the economy and our society. When I asked some residents about the many cameras placed at the void decks and some common areas, they generally believe that the Government is doing so for their safety and security. People trust that our Government is using the data captured for good. But this is not the case in some other countries. In places like San Francisco, the residents have voted against having videos in public places. For our own digitalisation efforts to succeed, people must trust that their data is collected solely for the purpose of developing useful services for them.By all accounts, we have done well thus far. But it is not inconceivable for some to begin to raise the issues of privacy and how their personal data is being used. The PDPA has put in place several measures to protect personal data, but the emergence of data protection legislation that favours more to data owners, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act, will cause some to wonder whether the PDPA is sufficiently rigorous to protect personal data. Similarly, since the Government's handling of citizens data is carved out from PDPA, a time will come where some will raise issues of privacy and accountability.Sir, my intent in raising these issues is for all us to be cognisant of the potential hazards awaiting us in our journey towards digitalising our economy and society. I believe strongly that we must leverage on technology, especially on those that will improve our quality of life. Internet banking, for example, means I do not have to queue up at bank branches anymore. Immediately, my quality of life has improved. So too for the many Apps that have been developed by both the private sector and our Government. But the flip side of all these new applications of technology are issues of accountability, transparency and trust. Can our Government protect us from being manipulated by the big tech giants? Can we trust our Government to use our personal data for the benefit of all Singaporeans and not some political agenda?These are questions of trust brought about by the use of technology in our everyday lives.Sir, trust between our Government and the people will undergo stresses as we grapple with these issues. The trust we have built over the past 60 years or so has given us a quality of life that is the envy of other nations. Going forward, what more can be done to nurture this trust? What can be done to meet the expectations of our people in an increasingly complex world we are living in today? We have seen how trust has broken down in other societies leading to the rise of populism. And with social media and the rise of misinformation and alternative facts, sometimes, it is unclear whether the lack of trust in Government is an effect of all these developments or it is the cause for the rise of alternative centres of trust.Our trust in public institutions in Singapore such as our hospitals, our schools, our courts and security agencies are indeed very high. This is because these institutions have been well managed, staffed by capable and competent people, and are known to deliver good and fair outcomes. We trust that these institutions will do what is right and just.Similarly, as we digitalise our society, trust that these technologies will be used correctly is important. There are ethical issues associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the use of machine learning algorithms. Can we trust that these technologies will be deployed in a manner that preserves the best interest of Singaporeans? Just like the guidelines for the use of AI which have been released by MCI in Davos earlier this year, perhaps there is a need for a community wide conversation on how these technologies should be deployed. Should we not consider the creation of an independent Digital Commission that looks at these concerns from all sides dispassionately. Just like the trust we have in our other public institutions, should we not consider similar public institutions that can build trust in our people in dealing with these new technologies?Sir, I raise these concerns and suggestions out of the belief that continuing digitalisation of our economy and society is a good thing but we cannot avoid the nagging concerns of privacy and transparency that digitalisation will bring. If we do not deal with this early, then trust in Government can be eroded. I hope creating an independent Digital Commission to look at these issues can help address these concerns. When human biomedical research raised some concerns, we created the Bioethics Advisory Committee to advise Government on these matters. It is time we have a similar committee for the digital revolution.Sir, the COVID-19 challenge will pass as other viruses infections have gone in the past. How this challenge will unfold is unclear. But given recent reports of infections in South Korea, Italy and Iran and the warning raised by the US health authorities, it will be sometime before this is over. Our own teams in Singapore have assured us that we are ready with new measures if the situation worsens. Our best response is to continue to be vigilant, practise the proposed hygiene practices and make it our way of life and look out for one another in this difficult time.How would this moment in our history be remembered?After SARS, the then Ministry for Community Development and Sports proposed the Fabric of the Nation project. As a nation, including our then Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong and his wife, we stitched together patches of fabric to symbolise the coming together of people from all walks of life in overcoming that challenge together. Today, that Fabric of the Nation hangs quietly in the lobby of MSF, a reminder of who we are as a people in times of crisis.It is still early for us to think of such projects of closure. But one thing we can do as a nation is to adopt new norms of hygiene standards, work-life balance arrangements, more adoption of technological ways of doing things such as running online classes and meetings, and other reasonable practices that can become our new way of life.I would add one more change and that is of our attitude towards those at the frontline in fighting this challenge. Someone has to keep Singapore clean, keep our transport system moving, ensure there is enough supplies in our markets and supermarkets, and attend to those who are sick and unwell as we battle this crisis. These are our fellow Singaporeans and workers who put their lives on the line for the sake of Singapore. They too have families anxious for the safety of their parents, siblings and loved ones either here or elsewhere. I am heartened by the responses of Singaporeans towards those at the frontline in this challenge.But can this be our way of life when all of this is over? The kindness and generosity we have seen to our frontline workers should be something history will remember us not just for this moment in our history but for defining who we are as a people. The dignity of every worker, no matter their occupation and station in life, must forever be maintained and cherished by all of us. Let us show to the world that these attitudes and behaviours are not a flash in the pan, but an integral part of our way of life. This is the legacy I hope we can bestow to succeeding generations that out of this moment in our history our better half triumphed over the other half and it became part of our enduring character. That is the Singapore story.Sir, I became a Member of this House on 2 January 1997. I am into my 24th year as a Member of Parliament. Perhaps, it is timely for me to thank you, your predecessors and Parliament staff, both past and present, all my colleagues in this Chamber, both past and present. It has been an opportunity of a lifetime to be able to serve the people of Singapore as an elected Member of Parliament. I will always cherish this experience for the rest of my life. So, thank you all for a wonderful experience. Sir, on that note, I support the Budget Statement. [Applause.]3.36 pmMs Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar): I am only 14 years in the Chamber, so I am still a junior to the Member. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget.Accolades abound for Budget 2020. Budget 2020, as they say has \"something for everyone\" from businesses to Singaporeans, young and old.Commendable are the agility and speed by which the Stabilisation and Support Package was put together to help sectors hit by COVID-19; the empathy to delay the GST increase this year, and the ability to keep an eye on both the short and longer term concerns of Singaporeans and businesses.Budget 2020 is responsive, prudent and balanced. The original draft must have been in the making for many months before the onset of the unexpected COVID-19 outbreak. I doubt if any other government can pull a focused Budget together like this with such agility and speed. So, kudos to Deputy Prime Minister Heng and the team for rising to the occasion!I would like to touch on five concerns arising from inputs of many Singaporeans I met.Concern one: an extended COVID-19 outbreak scenario. Not unexpectedly, the top-of-mind concern of Singaporeans is the \"what-if\" scenario of a longer-drawn COVID-19 outbreak leading to an extended global and local economic downturn. Many people are relieved and thankful that Government acted swiftly to delay the expected GST increase and boldly decided on a larger than expected budget deficit. But even with Deputy Prime Minister's recent public assurance that Government is prepared to do more if warranted, many people are nonetheless still worried about how long the Government will be able to sustain deficits of such a large quantum. What will an extended Stabilisation and Support package look like? How will it be funded if the impact is even more broad-based than the tourism, the retail and the transport sectors directly hit by the outbreak; when supply chain continues to be disrupted; when consumer sentiments and demands continue to decline and companies start to shed their local manpower? The anxiety is real and I seek Deputy Prime Minister's insights on this concern.Concern two: strengthening our Small-and-Medium Enterprises (SMEs). SMEs play an important role in all countries. In Singapore, they make up 99% of total enterprises and employ more than 70% of the workforce. The success of Singapore's economic restructuring and industrial transformations hinges plenty on the ability of Singapore's SMEs to re-invent themselves for the long term.Since 2010, a slew of Government initiatives was launched to help move SMEs up the value chain, streamline and digitalise operations and to venture overseas. However, actions and results too, lag aspirations and SMEs continue to be challenged, as observed by Singapore Business Federation (SBF) in December 2019. Mindsets, talents, or the lack of talents, especially in digitalisation and understanding of technology were cited to be key obstacles to business transformation.SMEs now face a more immediate challenge with the negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on businesses; except for perhaps the mask, disinfectant, sanitiser, or even toilet roll manufacturers and the like. Besides tourism, transport sectors and businesses that rely on the PRC supply chain, many businesses that have little to do with China directly are also affected; like smaller businesses in food catering and even event management which are hit by cancellation or postponement of local events.There is a general anxiety amongst the SMEs that they may not be able to survive the short term. Some are asking for administration of Budget measures to be more expedient and some ask for the extension of measures such as job support to be extended to six months. Mindsets of many SMEs are still on the \"here and now\" survival issues. Training and work system redesigns, work process redesigns are hitherto not corporate habits. This has been the perennial struggle of SMEs.What is the prognosis that our local SMEs will be strengthened by Budget 2020’s suite of Enterprise Grow and Enterprise Transform Packages? Will Singapore's economic transformation ever be supported by a very strong base of local innovative SMEs? Under current circumstances, what more can be done by Government and the rest of us to ensure that SMEs do come out of this crisis stronger? That is concern two on SMEs.Concern three: uplifting our vulnerable. Budget 2020 presents a galore of measures to help Singaporeans withcost of living in daily living, housing, healthcare, schooling and retirement.I am concerned about three particular groups who are still at risk: one, our low-skilled seniors who still take on jobs such as cleaners that challenge them physically; two, our younger Singaporeans who take on low-skilled jobs such as food delivery and even private hire driving, jobs that offer them short-term gains and some autonomy but sometimes, little long-term prospects; and three, our disabled citizens who are still unemployed or are holding jobs that may disappear as a result of the disruption of technology.How can Government and the rest of Singapore better support and uplift the vulnerable amongst us? Can more resources be invested to deep-dive and study their needs, create a spectrum of more suitable jobs and have more effective job placements? Can there be a more impactful and lasting way of signposting to guide them or even to create a jobs clearing house of sorts? For the disabled, which thankfully due to Government’s eyeballing and ground advocacy, things are improving but I feel it is still not enough. Is there a way by which the SkillsFuture movement can include them in a more substantive and systemic way?Concern four: income inequality. Income inequality is a hot topic for many societies including Singapore. It is indeed good news that our Department of Statistics reported that household income inequality as in 2019 was at its lowest in almost two decades, with a lower gini coefficient of 0.452 versus 0.458 the year before; and even lower at 0.398 after adjusting for Government transfers such as Workfare and GST rebates.Experts are telling us that the difference between the Third Industrial Revolution and the Fourth is the impact of depth and breadth of technological change on everyday life and business. From food to retail to banking, you name it, industries are going digital.Singapore's SkillsFuture movement is a brilliant one but the speed of change globally and in technology is formidable. The 500,000 or so citizens who tapped on their SkillsFuture Credit in the first tranche works out to be only about 20% of the resident labour force.Sir, while the issue of wealth inequality is as old as time, the Industry 4.0 will make income inequality an even bigger issue. Research shows that innovators, investors and high-skilled IT workers benefit the most in the future economy; and the rest of the population may be at risk of being left out. To avert this scenario of \"a-winner-takes-all\", how can we develop as many winners as possible amongst our people and businesses?The Government has moved several important chess pieces for our workforce to stay relevant and indeed, of course it is up to us Singaporeans to respond. But this is such an important topic. It still calls for a deeper dive, I believe, to remove the income inequality that will surely arise from the advent of technology. So, that is concern four on income inequality.My last concern in this speech is: SG Together. I wish to cover the important Singapore Together, or the SG Together, movement – a brainchild of Deputy Prime Minister Heng, and very typical of his style – at least to me – of listening and engaging others, including those not in the Cabinet or the Government. The Deputy Prime Minister, in January 2020, called SG Together the \"new cornerstone of nation building\" – a new model of partnership between Government and Singaporeans in owning, shaping and acting on our future to expand what is called the \"democracy of deeds\".SG Together indeed, I feel, is a significant and necessary direction. Issues of the day are so many and so complicated and complex that the Government no longer has the monopoly of ideas and action, and sometimes even resources. Many citizens, myself included, want to be part of the solution to make our society, not just successful economically, but also significant in the world.Besides the concerns I mentioned earlier regarding strengthening SMEs, uplifting our vulnerable and reducing income inequality, I can think of so many other areas in which Government and Singaporeans can work together: self-sufficiency in food production, impact of the rise of the robot workforce, more inclusive public housing estates, mobile or pop-up healthcare teams and clinics, living within our means in future Budget allocations, lifelong learning schools, grants for not just public housing but for private housing options, feeding the poor in a dignified way and many others.Some of us as enthusiastic advocates will need to acquire a broader understanding of not just our area of passion and needs, but also understanding of the eco-system and how different pieces affect other parts of society. If citizens want to harness resources, there must be a way by which the giver of resources, whether Government or private donors, can count on the track record and reliability of us citizens and partners. Hence, our need to not only demand but to build our competencies and credibility.But on the part of the Government, I feel there are forces within the Public Service and political system that, if we are not careful, could lead to the SG Together movement becoming tokenistic and not very impactful. Some of the changes I would ask the Government to consider to take SG Together to newer heights are these.One is on vision. Can the Government and Statutory Boards cast a wider vision of their role beyond their traditional scopes? MOE should be envisioned as the Ministry of Lifelong Learning. MEWR should be our Ministry of Sustainability. MOT is no longer dealing with just transportation but connectivity.On deployment, can we get rid of the possible thinking that only the best executives are the thinkers and remain as the head honchos in the Ministries? Can we deploy more of the best brains to the ground and develop their execution muscles? I remember the days when I was starting a leadership training firm in China many years ago and I failed miserably at the start. The business only took off after I sent my best top staff to China and when I regularly worked with my PRC team on the frontlines. There ought to be a strategy to change the way the Government views and deploys its best. Station them on the ground to learn, to facilitate, to forge alliances through personally experiencing the challenges on the frontlines. Similarly, the Government should be bold enough to appoint good mid-career practitioners to leadership positions in Public Service – offer them a bridging learning stint if need be. That may make a big difference in the complexion and the DNA of SG Together.And third, in terms of culture: the culture I believe that will drive SG Together to success will have to be one that learns to be less Ministry-centric and less controlling. The people of Singapore has trusted the Government for so long, it is time for the Government to also learn to trust the people too – not blindly, not indiscriminately, but in a less controlling and more facilitative manner.Sir, I believe that SG Together is a very important direction for the Government. It can end up as a lofty aspiration, but if done right, it will be a powerful driver to a stronger Singapore that can weather many storms heavier than COVID-19 or more tragic crises.Sir, in conclusion, I fully support the Budget and I seek the Deputy Prime Minister's consideration of the inputs that I have made. I also thank again the Deputy Prime Minister and the team behind Budget 2020 for their great work. [Applause.]Mr Speaker: Mr Png Eng Huat.3.50 pmMr Png Eng Huat (Hougang): Mr Speaker, monetary and fiscal policy can make or break a retirement dream. It would rather be meaningless for the working class to receive top-ups and transfers year after year at every Budget if there is no light at the end of the tunnel for them to realise their retirement dreams.In the illustration given in the Budget Annex, a retiree couple, both 65 years old, had only $570 a month in total to support their retirement needs, pre-Budget 2020. That is about $285 per retiree. A single person on the ComCare Long Term Assistance Scheme receives $600 a month for basic living expenses. There is no way for this couple to survive on $570 a month. The illustration went on to state that this couple has to supplement their retirement needs with family support and their own savings. What if this couple does not have family support and savings?There was a study released by two professors last year in which an elderly person aged 65 and above would need at least $1,379 a month to sustain a basic standard of living. That study has provided some food for thought about retirement adequacy.With the CPF system being the bedrock of our retirement plans, the Government expects seven-in-10 active CPF members from the 2021 and 2022 cohorts to be able to set aside their Basic Retirement Sum (BRS). That would mean that 30% of the members in these cohorts would not be able to live on their CPF payouts alone when they reach their Payout Eligibility Age (PEA) in 10 years’ time.But the more concerning part of the numbers highlighted in the Budget Annex is the six-in-10 CPF members who could not meet their BRS a decade ago. Some of these Singaporeans are on the old Retirement Sum Scheme and would have reached their PEA by now. I have met such members who are receiving less than $300 a month in CPF payouts. Some are still working as they do not have extended families or children to support them.So, for those with little or no savings for retirement, the measures announced in Budget 2020 should go some way to alleviate their hardship and uncertainty. The couple illustrated in the Annex at the beginning of my speech would receive $1,400 monthly, post-Budget 2020. Although this is a more meaningful payout per month, at $700 per retiree, it is still predicated on additional family support and their own savings, something policy makers should not presume when formulating policies on retirement adequacy.For Budget 2020, I welcome the Senior Worker Support Package to help keep jobs for our senior workers and to increase their CPF savings for their retirement needs somewhere down the road. I also welcome the Stabilisation and Support Package to help keep jobs for our workers in general during this period of uncertainty.Next, the enhancement to the Silver Support Scheme is also long overdue. The expanded criteria for lifelong wages from $70,000 to $140,000 in total CPF contributions and household monthly income per person are expected to benefit about 100,000 more Singaporeans aged 65 and above.A number of my residents were shut out of the Silver Support Scheme when it was introduced in 2015 as they had more than $70,000 in their CPF at age 55. Many of them wondered how long does the Government expect $70,000 in total CPF contributions at age 55 to last when housing alone would have taken a big chunk of it, if not all of it away? And these people would share that they were low-wage earners to begin with and were living paycheck to paycheck with little savings. Some of them would not qualify for the scheme as they are gainfully employed but homeless children are still living with them, for whatever reasons. The enhancements to the Silver Support Scheme is certainly a welcome move for elderly Singaporeans in these difficult times.Next, I have a small suggestion to make about the Grocery Vouchers scheme for Singaporeans aged 21 and above, who live in 1-room and 2-room HDB flats and do not own more than one property. These Singaporeans will receive $100 in Grocery Vouchers for 2020 and 2021.It was stated in the Budget Annex that these vouchers can be used at participating supermarkets and to date, NTUC Fairprice, Giant and Sheng Siong have agreed to accept these vouchers. The Grocery Vouchers scheme is expected tocost the Government $16 million.Would it not make more sense for the Government to avail these vouchers for all the mom-and-pop shops instead, so as to help these small businesses tide over this difficult period at the same time? The $16 million budgeted for the scheme would go a long way to help these local provision shops but it would only be a drop in the ocean for the three big supermarkets combined. NTUC Fairprice alone had reported a group revenue of $3.45 billion for FY2018.I can understand these big supermarkets would need to agree to accept these vouchers as they would be doing a form of community service. But for those mom-and-pop shops, I am quietly confident none of them would reject these Government-backed vouchers if presented for use.I have piloted such a voucher scheme for needy residents in Hougang. Our vouchers could be exchanged for anything, including cooking oil, detergents, toothpaste, toilet rolls and so on, with the standard restriction on alcohol and tobacco products. At the same time, these vouchers would actually benefit two small, owner-operated kiosks in Hougang.I hope the Government would consider supporting our mom-and-pop shops in a meaningful way in addition to the measures announced in the Budget. Extending the Grocery Vouchers scheme to our neighbourhood shops will help bring some buzz and business to the community. This is a win-win arrangement for needy residents and local provision shop owners.Finally, if there is one lesson for me to take away from this coronavirus outbreak that is gripping the world right now, it is certainly not about the blame game, the discrimination or the name calling. It is certainly not about the grocery run, the hoarding or the hunt for sanitisers and what-have-you. It is about helping a friend in need.When China sneezes, the world will catch a flu, whether we like it or not. The world’s factory will stop. No cheap raw materials. No cheap components. No cheap clothing. No cheap produce. And no tourists. The world has to be thankful to China for being able to provide all that for the benefits of consumers everywhere.So, it is imperative that we wish China a speedy recovery. It is also imperative for the world to help China to get back on its feet as soon as possible. The sooner China recovers, the better it will be for all. So, it is heartening for me to read that Singapore has dispatched a second round of humanitarian aid to China last week. It is important that in moments like these, a sense of common humanity that transcends border, race, language, or religion must prevail.Mr Speaker: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.20 pm.Sitting accordingly suspendedat 3.58 pm until 4.20 pm.Sitting resumed at 4.20 pm[Mr Speaker in the Chair]Debate on Annual Budget StatementDebate resumed.Mr Speaker: Mr Gan Thiam Poh. Sorry, Mr Lim Swee Say.Mr Lim Swee Say (East Coast): Mr Speaker, Sir, having served 23 years in Parliament, I ask myself, \"How have we done as an economy, society and nation?\"First, as an economy, our challenge is to maximise the upside of globalisation. Globalisation has redefined the world of technology and innovation, market and competition.The implication can be \"dua ho, dua pai\" in Hokkien or in Chinese, \"大好大坏\". Either very good or very bad. \"大好\", very good for those good enough to move up the economic ladder. \"大坏\", very bad for those unable to compete as they would be left farther behind. We are determined to succeed, to be \"大好\". To beat those who are cheaper than us, we try to be better than them. To beat those who are better than us, we try to be cheaper than them. But the cheaper keeps getting better and the better keeps getting cheaper.So, we restructure our economy continuously, faster than them. In short, we try to be cheaper, better, faster, not by lowering wages, but by raising skills and productivity and developing new business capabilities, so that we can command higher wages for our people, and higher premium for our businesses. We stay the course not just in good times, but also in bad.During the Global Financial Crisis, other countries cut job to savecost. With tripartite partnership, we did the opposite. We cutcosts to save jobs. They tried to survive the downturn. We upturned the downturn.So, with a L-shape recovery, many countries took years to recover from their massive job losses. But with a V-shape recovery, we took just a few months to return to full employment. Not many Singaporeans remember what we did right at a time when so much could have gone wrong for us. But for my brothers and sisters in the Labour Movement, we would never forget how much was at stake and how important it was, and always will be, that we get it right every time, including this time round with the Stabilisation and Support package.Sir, our local workforce is over two million. They need meaningful jobs and careers to take care of themselves and their families. It is never easy to compete globally for good jobs and investments. But because we dare to be different, we never say die, we have created not just over two million jobs for our people. In fact, we created more than three million jobs for Singapore.Out of the three types of growth – economic growth, employment growth and wage growth – many countries could achieve may be one out of three, or two out of three. But for Singapore, we have achieved three out of three, consistently, decade after decade. Indeed, we have done well as One Singapore Tripartism. We are winners, not losers in globalisation.Next, as a society, our challenge is to minimise the downside of globalisation. Globalisation has widened inequality globally. It has disunited nations, divided people and broken up societies. Countries and economies most affected negatively have one thing in common: they pursued economic growth as their end objective at the expense of social cohesion.Not us in Singapore. Our end objective in nation building has always been social cohesion, not economic growth. Economic growth is just a means for us to generate the resources we need to improve the lives of our people. This is why we counter social divides with social transfers. Billions of dollars in every term of government. We counter rising healthcarecost with MediShield Life for all and we take extra care of our seniors with PGP and MGP. Again, billions of dollars.We also keep strengthening social mobility and people well-being, from upgrading of public housing estates, to the expansion and renewal of public transport, the upgrading of schools and the upscaling of pre-school education. And the list goes on. Again, billions of dollars.In a world of growing divides, unrest and disunity, we in Singapore continue to live in peace and harmony. Because from 1G to 2G to 3G, we never forget to channel the revenue generated from our competitive economy to take better care of our people. With this Unity Budget, our 4G is doing the same, and more. It will further strengthen our unity, cohesion and inclusiveness as One Singapore United.Last but not least, as a nation, we need to strengthen our sustainability for our long-term progress. Nation building is a journey with no end. \"人无远虑 必有近忧\" in Chinese. That is, if one generation does not worry for the next generation, our future generations will have much to worry about. By then, it could be too late.Water supply is a prime example. Two-thirds of the world is covered with water, yet the world is short of clean drinking water. As an island, we could keep adding to our water supply with desalination. But it will be energy intensive,costly and environmentally unfriendly. So, we came up with a same-same but different solution: not just adding, but also multiplying our water supply. We closed our water loop and we turned every drop of water into two drops or more with the advances in membrane technology.With the support of the entire nation, we achieved something unachievable in other places – the public acceptance of NEWater. And we pressed on for more – from NEWater to Green Sand to Zero Landfills.Indeed, despite our many limitations as a small country, we have done well as One Singapore Unlimited.Mr Speaker, Sir, looking ahead, \"逆水行舟 不进则退\". Nation building is a journey against the flow. The global environment for trade and investment is changing, becoming more unconducive. Some countries may choose to continue to pursue globalisation – business as usual. Social gaps could widen more and the societies could become more divided. Some may choose to change track, towards de-globalisation. Their economies could become more inward looking and eventually, less competitive.For Singapore, our choice is clear. What we want is neither globalisation with a divided society, nor de-globalisation with a less competitive economy. We want the best of both worlds – a globally competitive economy and a locally cohesive society, both at the same time. \"Globalisation\" plus \"localisation\" give us \"glocalisation\" in short.How can we do better with \"glocalisation\"?First, for our Future Economy to be globally competitive, we must strive to be a pioneer and leader in the pervasive innovation with Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is not new. The concept of thinking machine and machine learning has been around for 60 years. One of the early applications of AI is language translation. In the early days, someone keyed in \"out of sight, out of mind\". After being translated into another language and then back into English for verification, what came back was –\"a blind idiot\".AI has come a long way since then, not just in language translation, but in many areas, from banking to medical, engineering, data analytics and more. Together, AI and HI or human intelligence, \"如虎添翼\", can be like a tiger with wings, a powerful force to reshape our future, for the better.The number one economy of today and the number one economy of tomorrow are competing head on to be the number one powerhouse in AI. Singapore, too, must do well in AI. And we can.When the First Conference on Innovative Applications of AI was held 31 years ago in 1989 in Stanford University, 30 pioneering AI applications worldwide were selected for presentation. And guess what? One of them came from Singapore!A group of AI Engineers from Information Technology Institute (ITI) presented the expert system they jointly built with the human experts at our PSA. With the recent launch of the National AI Strategy, we now have a national platform to innovate with AI faster and exploit AI better. We must run fast and excel in our ability to combine the complementary strengths of AI and HI, so that we can transform our future Singapore economy into one of the smartest in the future world.Next, for our future society to be locally cohesive, we must turn three growing social divides into social unities. First, \"High versus Low\".The success of a country is not judged by how well the people at the top are doing, but by how well the people at the bottom are helped by the government and treated by the general public.Widening income gap can and must be narrowed. Progressive Wage Model (PWM) has four ladders of job, skill, productivity and wage. It can help transform every low-wage job into a better job, every low-wage worker into a better worker. I urge our 4G leadership to widen and deepen the adoption of PWM, more proactively and more passionately, to many more jobs in many more sectors. So that the social divide of \"High versus Low\" can be turned into the social unity of \"High and Low\", moving up our employment ladder together.Second, \"Young versus Old\". Retirement age and re-employment age are set to move up progressively. This is good. But I hope much more will be done to transform many more jobs to be ESS – Easier, Safer and Smarter for our older workers. So that they can live more years of H2P2 life as we live longer. H2P2 – Happy and Healthy, Productive and Purposeful.Last but not least, local versus foreign. Competition for good jobs is global. Under SkillsFuture, we are doing much more to upskill and re-skill our people. This is good. At the same time, I hope we will do more to transfer capabilities, especially new and emerging capabilities that are in short global supply from the foreign manpower, both local here and overseas, to our people more systematically and proactively. This is one best way to reduce the lose-lose mindset of local versus foreign – two-third versus one-third – and grow the win-win mindset of two-third plus one-third, equals greater than one.Mr Speaker, Sir, finally, for our future Singapore to be more livable, we need to forge a greater sense of pride and ownership in our living environment. Fifty years ago, we were a pioneer in embracing Clean and Green. Today, we are a pioneer in NEWater. Moving forward, I feel, what we need is to create an environment where everyone in Singapore can participate everyday and everywhere in a more active and visible manner as part of our daily life.From more use of reusable bag and environmental-friendly car, to the separation of waste for recycling, returning of trays at the F&B outlets and so on. I hope we will strive to be a leading nation in our social behavior to improve our environmental performance and sustainability, so that our future Singapore will truly be a better Singapore in all aspects – more competitive, more cohesive, more socially responsible and more environmentally responsive.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, Sir, today, Singapore is a competitive economy, a cohesive society and a nation which can develop sustainably. This has been achieved through the collective efforts of all Singaporeans.The question is, why is it that most countries have capable and hardworking people but only a few countries can perform well? I think one of the key factors lies with the quality and style of leadership. In some countries, leaders are only concerned with \"xiao wo\" or self-interest. They jostle for power and put their self-interest above that of the country and its people. As a result, people’s lives are neglected and the country fails, with nothing being achieved.On the other hand, leaders from some countries adopt a \"zi wo\" or \"self centred\" leadership style. They can perform well in the short run but are egoistic and lack successors. As a result, they may do well in the short run but this success cannot be sustained for long.Fortunately, leaders from some countries adopt the \"da wo\" leadership style, or a selfless leadership style that focuses on the greater good. When they are in power, they work tirelessly to serve the country and its people. At the same time, they focus on the future and continue to groom their successors, because they know that no one can escape death and illness, and this is the law of nature.Every one of us will become old, but a country's leadership cannot become old. This is because nation building is an endless journey. Therefore, while these leaders are serving the country and its people, they also spare no efforts in grooming leaders for the next generation. By doing this generation after generation, the country's leaders can keep up with the times and continue to do good for the people. Under their leadership, the country can achieve good progress, regardless of short-term or long- term developments.From the first to the current third generation leaders, Singapore has continued to grow from strength to strength under the \"da wo\" leadership style. I hope the 4G Leaders will uphold the same spirit and prioritise our country's long-term development and our citizens’ long-term interest above everything else.I also hope that our people will always treasure this leadership style. Only by doing this, can Singapore continue to progress and can generations of Singaporeans live better and be happier than their predecessors.(In English):Mr Speaker, Sir, a few months ago, I had a private dinner with Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat. He left a deep impression on me – not with his vast knowledge and deep knowledge about nation building, because that I already knew. Minister Mentor once said Heng Swee Keat has one of the best brains in Singapore. And what came across clearly and strongly for me that dinner, over a four-hour dinner, was that he also has one of the most caring hearts for Singapore and for Singaporeans.We shared our views on many topics and many issues. But the one that stood out clearly was his passion and his commitment in what is known today as \"Singapore Together\". At the dinner, Singapore Together had not been launched yet. But later on, the more I heard about Singapore Together, the more I understood what he is trying to do and why that night he was so passionate talking about this.Singapore would not be where we are today if not for the tripartite partnership in our economy and the 3P partnership in our society. Under his leadership, it is loud and clear to me that Deputy Prime Minister wants the 4G leaders to do even better, to do even more – engaging with Singaporeans, consulting them, rallying them to contribute ideas and act in concert, because he wants to forge a national ownership that is shared by all Singaporeans in the future development of Singapore.Mr Speaker, Sir, I always believe, all my life that, \"People do not care how much you know, until they know how much you care\". I am heartened that our 4G leadership not only knows a lot about challenges in nation building, but also cares a lot about the sentiment, anxiety, aspiration and inspiration of our people.I urge everyone in this House, and all our fellow Singaporeans, let us all put our hearts, our heads and our hands together, to jointly create our future Singapore. One that is more globally competitive, more locally cohesive and more sustainable with unlimited potential. One that all of us, will co-own and all will be proud of. Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore Together, Majulah Forever. I support the Budget. [Applause.]4.41 pmMr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio): Mr Speaker, in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the frontline healthcare workers, as well as frontline staff from MINDEF, SCDF and the various agencies. Of course, we must also thank all Singaporeans for their support and cooperation. I am confident that we will be able to overcome this COVID-19 outbreak together.(In English):I join my Parliamentary colleagues in supporting this year's very substantial Budget. The size of the commitment will go a long way to tide us over a challenging and uncertain period. Just as our economy had seen its weakest growth since the 2008 Financial Crisis, the COVID-19 outbreak struck us out of the blue and there is not a single person here who has not felt its impact in one way or another.The $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package will be a great help to businesses, with cash flow and jobs support. The Package is well-considered, taking into account the various aspects of employment so that we can help our workers retain their jobs and prepare for the future. The Jobs Support Scheme offers temporary wage offsetting, the Wage Credit Scheme enhancement co-funds wage increases and the extended Adapt and Grow Initiative will boost training and re-skilling.I would just like to request that the Finance Minister consider disbursing the Jobs Support Scheme payments earlier than the targeted date of end-July. Many of the smaller companies are already struggling to remain in business and it would be tough for them to wait for another five months. The timing of the payouts could mean the difference between survival and failure for some. Furthermore, we must consider the knock-on effects of company closures on other connected businesses. The potential chain reaction should not be underestimated. Hence, I urge the Minister to consider expediting the assistance.The Government's decision to target support for the five sectors directly hit by COVID-19 is understandable. Funds are limited and the amounts must be large enough to be impactful. I appeal for some support for businesses connected to the five supported sectors of tourism, aviation, retail, food services and point-to-point transport services as well. Suppliers to businesses in these five sectors are suffering too, as it is common that these five sectors outsource services to vendors and suppliers. I hope the Ministry would consider introducing some measures to assist companies which are similarly affected, due to their dealings with firms in these five sectors.It is a great idea to encourage companies to send their employees for training and re-skilling. However, many smaller companies are unable to do so. Some of these small companies are almost fire-fighting every day, they are also stretched for manpower, it is almost impossible to send workers for training. In addition, they may not have the financial means to do so.  I would like to ask the Ministry whether they are able to assist such smaller companies with the kind of difficulties that I mentioned. The Government has committed to work with large anchor enterprises to support training for their sectors. May I ask if this plan would help to address the concern I have just mentioned?Some Singaporeans who were retrenched earlier would have greater difficulty getting jobs now. We sympathise with their difficulties. They express their desire to continue working, not receiving financial assistance. Companies should be incentivised and encouraged with rewards to give these Singaporean job seekers the highest priority for available jobs in their firms, especially those in their 40s and above who are willing to take part in professional conversion programmes, before granting EPs, SPs or WPs. The proposed hiring incentive for employers, which provides 20% salary support to the employers for six months, is attractive and I hope the Government will monitor its effectiveness. How will the Government determine the scheme’s effectiveness and under what conditions will the Ministry review existing programmes to support the employability of Singaporeans?Next, I would like to share some suggestions about the support for the point-to-point transport service sector.Firstly, Private Hire Car (PHC) drivers who drive an average of 6.7 trips per day will qualify for the $10 per day relief. For taxi drivers, the hirer will qualify for the $10 per day relief and each hirer, being a full-time taxi driver, typically has to drive 15 to 18 trips per day. Each hirer typically has a relief driver who also drives about 10 to 15 trips per day but relief drivers do not qualify for the $10 per day relief. Could MOT consider extending such an assistance scheme to support taxi relief drivers?Secondly, taxi operators, typically asset-heavy, carry highercosts and have to pay road tax, corporate tax and so on. Ride-hailing companies, which are asset-light, do not have to pay any such taxes as they are borne by the drivers. Hence, thecost structures of both are different. Taxi operators are matching the $10 a day relief fund by providing a rental rebate of $10 a day or more. Ride-hailing companies do not need to match $10 a day.PHC drivers typically pay 20% commission based on the total fare collection. For an average day, PHC drivers pay about $36 in commission and the $10 per day relief is equivalent to 27.8% of their expenses. On the other hand, taxi rental per day is about $100. Thus, $10 a day relief is equivalent to 10% of the expenses of a taxi driver. Would the Ministry consider reviewing the SRF in view of the differentcost structures of both?Finally, we should also note that we have a significant number of self-employed or freelancers amongst us who will not be eligible for the various assistance schemes, such as the Jobs Support Scheme.For example, many tourist guides are self-employed. Would the Government roll out measures to help them find other temporary and part-time jobs? This group of workers can be redeployed to other tasks, such as temperature-taking. I saw on TV recently there were some who have taken it up. They would need job counselling and advisory to point them to available temporary jobs or even career changes so that they can continue to secure a livelihood.4.49 pmMs Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very grateful and relieved that our country is able to finance this $106 billion Unity Budget without having to draw on our reserves nor burden future generations. We thank our predecessors for their thrift and wisdom in building up our reserves and assets which provide the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC). This year's NIRC is expected to remain the top contributor to our revenue, ahead of corporate and personal income tax and the Goods and Services Tax (GST). In addition, we have benefited from careful and tactical planning which ensures that we accumulate and set aside surpluses for a rainy day. Thus, we are much better prepared to weather this storm of global uncertainty, economic shifts and the COVID-19 outbreak.The $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package and $1.6 billion Care and Support Package will provide substantial help to businesses and households to deal with the short-term challenges ahead. Furthermore, this Budget goes beyond the immediate present and sets aside funds for mid- and long-term goals.Today, Sir, I would like to focus on assistance for the vulnerable and needy and request for more resources to be committed to help them. This is a topic very close to my heart. This year, the expenditure for Social and Family Development is expected to increase by 8.5% to $3.3 billion. Our Social Service Offices (SSO) play an important role in coordinating social assistance for needy residents. Most vulnerable households face multiple problems. They need help with their finances, job seeking, family relationship problems, health issues, care for their children, elderly or disabled family members. Living from hand to mouth, struggling to just make it through the day, it is daunting for them to figure out where to ask for help, let alone approach different Government agencies. It is very helpful that SSO, the coordinating body, provides them with the necessary guidance and help, such as job matching and linking them up with the relevant Government assistance schemes and services and voluntary welfare organisations.The SSO provides a customised social service, catering to the different requirements of each distressed resident or family. This is labour-intensive work and, not surprisingly, our SSOs are very much stretched in terms of resources, specifically manpower. This makes it hard for them to follow up with individuals or families to see if they are doing fine after help has been rendered and the cases considered closed. Many social workers and case officers would definitely want to follow up to ensure their cases are okay because, in reality, there are always lingering or recurring problems which pop up as this vulnerable segment goes through the different stages in their recovery or relapse. However, with new cases approaching the SSOs for help, the challenge is having to prioritise with the very limited resources.Presently, with so many touch and contact points, picking up and identifying cases is not so much of a problem. Doing a longer and more thorough follow-up is the real challenge. Our social workers and officers need time to build rapport with these families and establish trust. Over a long period, with greater and deeper understanding of their cases, they could be more effective at proposing more long-term solutions and detecting other underlying or potential problems. This is very important, particularly where children or the elderly are involved. These are two groups of people who may not be able to articulate their problems or speak up for themselves. Protecting and helping children is one of the most important things we should do because we want to enable them to grow up into healthy and well-adjusted individuals who can take care of themselves, break out of the poverty cycle and become contributing members of our community.I would like to propose that we tap on seniors and older workers to help in this area of work as they have good experience and wisdom. Besides providing more funding to hire them, we would also need to train those who are joining these positions mid-career.Allow me to share my constituency experience about a senior who has been volunteering in my Henderson Dawson welfare committee after his retirement. Mr Ho Yew Wai, aged 70, is my resident. He retired three years ago as a senior counsellor in the Family Court. He visits individuals and families in distress, patiently talks to them and understands their issues, then works with our SSO, various Government agencies and voluntary welfare organisations to ensure these families receive holistic help. After a couple of months of the case closing, he will get in touch with the families to ensure all is well. This goes on till he is confident that the family is alright. If something has gone wrong mid-way, he will work with SSO again.However, much time and resources are needed for such a follow-up, and there are just that many cases one can handle. If this follow-up portion can be delegated to people like Mr Ho, someone who loves people, enjoys working with people and who has such invaluable experience and, if a system can be put in place, the SSO officers can be freed up to do the earlier coordination and intervention work. Sir, in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.] Investing in resources to take care of our less privileged groups will yield positive results many times over. The young will break free from the poverty trap, lifting their families with them. Those who are down will not remain down and out for long with many helping hands to pull them up. Together, we will build a stronger, more unified Singapore. I support the Budget. Thank you.4.56 pmMr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of Budget 2020.Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced the vision to phase out Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles and for all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040.One of the measures to push more people to buy electric vehicles (EVs) is the introduction of the EV Early Adoption Incentive. This is a 45% rebate on the Additional Registration Fee (ARF), capped at $20,000.Sir, I would like to highlight that while the $20,000 is generous, I feel it may not be sufficient to push more people to buy EVs. A comparison of the price of EV versions with ICE or hybrid versions of the same car model shows that EV versions currently sells at a significant premium to their ICE or hybrid equivalent. This is mainly because lithium ion batteries are very expensive. Moreover,costs incurred by car distributors to bring in EV models are spread over a small number of cars, thus increasing the per carcosts. For instance, a Hyundai Ioniq Electric currently sells for $152,000, a premium of $44,000 over its hybrid sibling.The story is the same for plug-in hybrids which allow charging as a source of energy. A Volvo S60 plug-in hybrid sells for $265,000, a whopping $90,000 over its normal S60 equivalent.Factoring in the higher road tax for EVs, which will be introduced to compensate for the loss of fuel excise duties, I think EV adoption will continue to be slow.Mr Speaker, another area which I think we have look at is to push local car distributors to bring in more EV and plug-in hybrid models. While car manufacturers have introduced more car models with cleaner engine technologies, local distributors have been slow to bring them in. For instance, Volkswagen has an EV version of its Golf, called the e-Golf, but it is not available here. The story is the same for Japanese cars. Honda has a very cute EV called Honda E, again, not sold here.A check among the mainstream car brands sold here indicated that there are only eight EV car models which consumers can choose from. Last year, the top three car manufacturers are Honda, Toyota and, surprisingly, Mercedes. Together, they account for more than 28% of total car sales. Unfortunately, none of them brings in an EV or plug-in hybrid model.Sir, unless we can make car distributors bring in more EV models, our push towards EV is doomed to fail. To address this, I would like to suggest the following measures. While we have a longer term view for the year 2040, I think we need short and medium term targets as well.I would like to suggest that for all mainstream car distributors selling more than 1,000 cars annually, 5% of their cars must be pure EV or plug-in hybrid models in five years’ time. In 10 years' time, by 2030, this will be raised to 20%. Frankly, if we cannot meet 20% by 2030, there is no way we can meet 100% by 2040.Without this push, our investment in charging stations will be wasted and the charging stations will become white elephants.To incentivise car dealers to bring in EV and plug-in hybrid models, there should be double tax deduction for expenses incurred to bring in these car models. Profits from such sales can also be taxed at a lower corporate income tax rate of 10%. For car dealers who are unable to meet the target, a $5,000 ICE tax can be levied on every ICE car model which they sell.Mr Speaker, the vision of 100% clean energy vehicles by 2040 is a bold one. In order to increase the adoption of cars running on cleaner energy, we need to look at the whole value chain and not just from the car buyers' perspective. I hope that both MOF and MOT will look into my suggestions.5.01 pmDr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Budget. Sir, COVID-19 has shown and demonstrated that robust contingency planning is necessary to ensure that we can cope with the worst effects of crises. Singaporeans have expressed confidence in the foresight of our Government and its willingness to spare no expense in ensuring that sufficient provisions are made for times of emergency. Far-sighted and robust contingency planning has allowed us to prevail over crises in times past and will help us to tide over crises in times to come. Budget 2020 is testimony of the commitment of our Government to help businesses and Singaporeans to overcome the COVID-19 outbreak.Sir, I wish to speak on the importance of contingency planning. In particular, I wish to speak on how we can build capabilities in our Government, businesses and the community to ensure that we are prepared for future emergencies or crises. I would also like to propose some measures that the Government can facilitate to alleviate the strain placed on our nation by COVID-19.Sir, I would like to call on the Government, businesses and shareholders in the community to develop and implement business continuity plan to make Singapore and Singaporeans more resilient against threats of varying natures.Business Continuity Plan, abbreviated as BCP, has proven to be useful. Please allow me to cite two examples. On the government level, the Tourism Authority of Thailand was able to use its BCP to help the Thai tourism industry recover after crises, such as the 2004 tsunami and the 2009 riots.On the business level, Nissan’s contingency planning, which was reviewed and refined multiple times over the years, allowed it to minimise production disruptions following the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. Its BCP includes measures, such as establishing a database to keep stock of supplies during an emergency, making its command structure mobile and drawing from a global supply chain made possible with alliances, such as the one with Renault.Sir, we should consider learning from best practices overseas and press for both our Government agencies and businesses in Singapore to develop BCPs. To facilitate the effective development of BCP in business, the Government can issue Business Continuity Plan Guidelines to the private sector, as the Cabinet Office of Japan did in 2005. Sir, we should be as ambitious as them and aim to have 100% of our large-sized and 50% of our medium-sized enterprises formulate these BCPs and have them executable in 10 years.At this juncture, I wish to share that the 15 PAP Town Councils are reviewing their respective Business Continuity Plans to ensure that they are kept operational even during times of crises. Last year, we started to develop our BCP framework in accordance with international standards, that is, ISO 22301, to ensure that the plans are objectively consistent, credible and viable. In addition to the operational benefits this will yield, on a psychological level, this will inspire confidence in our residents that their needs will continue to be taken care of during a crisis.With COVID-19, it is patently clear that even the best-designed Business Continuity Plan may be found wanting, especially when global supply chains are disrupted and fear spreads within communities. There is no shortage of literature displaying the dismal effects of COVID-19 on our businesses. Firms in the aviation, tourism, retail, food and beverage and transport industries have been hit especially hard.Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to propose some measures that the Government can undertake to help these businesses and restore confidence.First, by boosting consumer demand. This can be done by providing matching grants to businesses when they give discount vouchers to consumers. Sir, many customers are concerned with the situation and choose to stay at home. This has caused many businesses to hemorrhage money as there are significant overheadcosts. To keep our businesses afloat, it is important that measures which incentivise consumers to consume are implemented. Businesses can entice consumers by giving them monthly discount coupons on air tickets, hotel stays and shopping vouchers. The Government can help by giving matching grants to these businesses to help soften the blow of COVID-19.Second, by boosting consumer confidence. This can be done by increasing the frequency of cleaning, disinfecting our surroundings and improving on hygiene. We can ensure that temperature checks are conducted at all shopping centres, hotels and tourist attractions. These measures will further boost consumer confidence to visit Singapore and our attractions.Sir, restrooms are a visible gauge of hygiene standards. An ill-maintained, dirty restroom is likely to evoke thoughts of disease growth and feelings of repulsion. As such, the maintenance of clean toilets in Singapore can reduce these unpleasant sentiments and incentivise consumption by boosting confidence that measures to reduce the risk of disease transmission are being taken.In January 2020, North West CDC implemented a project named \"Clean Toilets @ North West\" to transform all toilets at coffeeshops. Based on the experience and expertise of various stakeholders, such as architects, interior designers, coffeeshop operators and users, we have developed a new benchmark for clean toilets at coffeeshops. By using the correct designs and materials, toilets can be built to achieve these desired outcomes as follows: first, robust and vandalism-proof; second, easy to maintain; and third, clean and safe for users. This, together with the professional training of cleaners and continuously educating our users to be kind and gracious when using toilets, can transform the toilet culture in Singapore. At the same time, it will remove potential breeding spots for bacteria and diseases.Sir, we have adopted the Clean Toilet benchmark and upgraded a coffeeshop in Bukit Panjang as a \"show flat\" for clean toilets. Details of the Clean Toilet project can be downloaded from North West CDC’s website. We are pleased to note that all the coffeeshop operators in Bukit Panjang have agreed to upgrade their toilets to meet this new benchmark. This will transform our toilets to be clean and safe.Sir, the adoption of these standards will inspire confidence in our hygiene and safety standards and will continue to boost consumption.Sir, many will say that this is a pipe dream, given the current culture surrounding toilet usage. However, the South Korean government was able to enact huge, and, more importantly, lasting changes within the span of eight years. Clean toilets are the norm today. The transformation has been permanent and successful, with South Korean toilets continuing to be some of the cleanest in the world, 26 years after the start of the South Korean Restroom Reform. We should learn from their experiences and start our own Singaporean Restroom Revolution.Sir, I have spoken on building capabilities on the Government and business levels. I wish to now speak on building capabilities in the community.The community forms the first and last bulwarks against threats. It is likely that members of the public will be the first responders in crises. As such, community participation should be factored into our contingency plans. It is imperative that we equip our people with the knowledge and skills to survive and to help others during a crisis.Sir, volunteers from North West CDC have developed a mobile application called \"North West 911\" to provide a mobile toolkit which one can access from the convenience of their mobile devices anywhere and anytime to better respond to emergencies. This app provides an emergency preparedness and response protocol guide for 14 crisis scenarios, such as fire, flood, bomb threats or infectious disease outbreak. It also has an illustrated first-aid guide, an emergency bag inventory checklist, a resource directory covering clinics, polyclinics, hospitals, police stations, civil defence shelters, community centres and emergency telephone numbers which Singaporeans can call to seek assistance when in Singapore or in the 10 most frequently travelled overseas destinations by Singaporeans.Sir, there is great potential with this app, given that there are 4.7 million smart mobile device users in Singapore. By having this app downloaded by these users, we can build a 4.7 million strong community of lifesavers. I would like to urge Members of this House to download the app to your smartphones. Just go to your respective app store as the app is available on both iOS and Android, key in \"North West 911\" and take the lead in preparing for emergencies.Mr Speaker, Sir, we should empower the community to come up with innovative solutions like North West 911 and build capabilities in our people to cope better during emergencies. In this regard, I would urge the Finance Minister to consider setting up an Emergency Preparedness Endowment Fund to continually train all Singaporeans to be prepared for crises which may occur in the future.In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my call to the Government, businesses and the community to develop robust contingency plans and for crisis management capabilities to be developed at all levels of Singaporean society.5.13 pmMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok): Mr Speaker, Sir, before I start my speech, I wish to congratulate the hon Member of Parliament Mr Lim Swee Say for his well-delivered speech in his special style, replete with new acronyms. He spoke from the heart and made many instructive points. One that resonated with me which I think is worth repeating in this House is that it is exceptional for a government to achieve real wage growth, real employment growth and economic growth, all at the same time.He also reminded us that growth is not just for its own sake but it is, ultimately, about making Singapore stronger together as a society, for now and the future. His clarion call to work together to progress forever is something all Singaporeans must join in.Sir, in my speech, I will make two suggestions, seek one clarification and then I will end off with an observation.Turning to suggestions, on the Stabilisation package, the hon Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Mr Heng expressed gratitude on behalf of the Government to all frontline officers and then he outlined the Stabilisation package. Many hon Members, including Mr Seah Kian Peng, and Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon today also echoed the sentiments of gratitude to the frontline officers. I wish to draw attention not just to these officers but their families.A few weeks ago, I metMdm Jorah. She is 57 years old. She is a nurse with Bukit Batok polyclinic. She was accompanied by her husband, who is a stroke patient. Her husband shared with me that on occasions,Mdm Jorahcame back and shed tears. This was because she was scolded at the clinic by patients who were demanding for surgical masks even though they did not have symptoms. Her husband was the one who provided emotional support for her and as a result,Mdm Jorahwas able to carry on with her duties.I am sure there are many such examples of families supporting frontline officers. I believe these families must be recognised and supported, and to this, I make two suggestions. First is, if they are put to expense because of these deployment requirements, then I think it is only fair for them to be recompensed. One example is if they have to cancel a travel arrangement because leave had to be cancelled. Alternatively, if there had to be some care arrangement, like for example,Mdm Jorah's husband is stroke-ridden and she had to make arrangements so that he could be taken care of while she goes back to the clinic. Perhaps this can be considered.The other thing is, it would be good if we can put together a package of discounts and even gifts for goods and services for the families. We could use perhaps the Courage Fund, with participation from Singaporeans and the private sector. The Government can play a role in providing the funds and funding incentives for organisations to honour our frontline staff and their families.My next suggestion involves the Enabling Employment Credit (EEC). I laud the introduction of this EEC to incentivise employers to employ and retain persons with disabilities (PWDs). Just a short clarification, I would seek to understand what is the definition of PWD for this scheme? Would it, for example, include persons with mental disabilities? I know voluntary organisations such as Bizlink, who do good work on this front, would benefit if this is so.Returning back to the point I want to make: I wonder if similar credit could be provided to employers of ex-offenders? Now, ex-offenders still have a problem in securing decent jobs. I met Mr R – he is 66 years old. He has just been released from prison after serving five years for selling contraband cigarettes. He is exceptionally fit and looks much younger than his age. He has Secondary 2 education and speaks good English. He told me that he could only secure a part-time job as a coffee shop attendant earning $40 a day. His salary seldom goes beyond $800 a month.Many ex-offenders are under-employed. And I wonder if the EEC could be extended to provide incentives to employers to employ or give full employment to ex-offenders. We can even work the EEC such that it can be crafted to reward ex-offenders if they were to stay on working and fully rehabilitate themselves. I think that would translate to some level of savings on behalf of the Government as well, because they do not re-offend.This would strengthen the \"Unity\" element of the Budget.Before I go on to seek my clarification, I also want to acknowledge the good work of SCORE in securing employment for ex-offenders. But we can do our part to help SCORE to do its work to get better jobs for ex-offenders.On the clarification, Mr Yee Chia Hsing spoke about electric vehicles (EVs). I note the Deputy Prime Minister's bold vision of phasing out internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and having all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040.The incentives appear to centre on encouraging EV adoption as opposed to other options such as Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles (HFCVs), which are favoured by countries such as Japan and South Korea. The Deputy Prime Minister said and I quote, \"The Government is placing a significant bet on EVs.\" Deputy Prime Minister Heng does not seem to me like a betting person, but may I please ask what is the basis of optimism over EVs as opposed to HFCVs? Also, what kind of infrastructural development is required to achieve the aim of 28,000 charges by 2030? Do we need to build more substations, for example? What is the expectedcost? Would there becost recovery from users and if so, how do you do so?I wish to share one point though from personal experience. There is a potential for municipal issues to creep in during the transition period when you convert parking lots for ICE cars to EVs. I have dealt with situations where there have been complaints that EVs take the more accessible parking lots as opposed to ICE cars. So, sometimes, there is scope for such complaints to come up. Going forward, it may be better for a transparent, demand-driven model for conversion of lots.Next, on the vehicular tax structure, I note that the Deputy Prime Minister is contemplating a lump sum tax for EVs to account for loss in fuel excise duties. I appreciate that fuel excise duties generate revenue and are also imposed to discourage excessive driving. It also has another element: it promotes less pollution. So, I take it that in relation to this lump sum tax that the Deputy Prime Minister contemplates to impose, at least there will be certain savings for EV users because it promotes less pollution. I welcome a clarification.I end off with an observation. I had the chance to gather feedback from residents and committee leaders in Bukit Batok following Deputy Prime Minister Heng's delivery of the Budget Statement. The observations that were shared were that it was very comprehensive, that it deals with \"live\" issues on the ground, particularly the fears of mid-career workers,cost of living, and of course, the economic challenge posed by COVID-19.This reflects the extent of consultation that Deputy Prime Minister Heng and his colleagues engaged with people on the ground. I understand from his speech that about 1,000 leaders from different parts of society were engaged and their ideas were incorporated in this Budget. Truly, this is a \"Unity\" Budget from conception.The $106-billion expenditure is a headline grabber. I do not recall many other Budgets crossing this $100-billion mark. But we were able to do it without drawing our Reserves. Mr Liang Eng Hwa highlighted this point in his speech and he highlighted that the prudent expenditure policy of the Government helped in this regard.But one thing which I thought is worth highlighting is that over the years, this Government had been making a heavy investment to grow the collective capabilities of our people and this in turn allowed us to achieve the real income growth as well as the economic growth. As a result, operating revenue actually went up. I checked the figures. At the start of the term of Government this year, it was about $64 billion. Now, it is about $75 billion. So, that is real growth resulting in revenue increase and I laud the Government for that. With that, I end my speech.Mr Speaker: Mr Saktiandi Supaat.5.22 pmMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Mr Speaker, Budget 2020 is a balanced Budget with a two-pronged approach. There is a clear short-term focus on fighting the impact of COVID-19. This takes the form of protecting local jobs, lowering corporatecost structures and household stimuli to mitigate the worries concerning the day-to-day expenses. Structural transformation of the workforce continues to be the mid-term focus. It is important that even in the midst of a crisis, we must not lose perspective of the future. By recovering faster than the rest, we can leverage on a stronger headstart. In the long-term, not to mention, the efforts focused on climate change.Mr Speaker, I will focus on three topics.The first topic is on help for businesses. Businesses are the bread and butter of our nation. The Deputy Prime Minister is right to address the immediate cash flow needs of businesses and wages are a big part of this. The Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) will certainly help to encourage enterprises to retain their local employees during this period of uncertainty.I have two concerns. Eligible employees will receive the payment by 31 July 2020 for wages paid out from the months of October to December 2019. Can this duration be shortened? Otherwise it is almost half a year from now, which may not come in time for SMEs facing liquidity challenges. I urge for efforts to be made to prioritise payouts to companies whose finances are in poorer shape.Another concern is the period that we are basing the wages off. Let us say an employer has hired an employee through the months of October to December. He lays off the said employee in March. I assume he will still receive his JSS payout. However, does that not defeat the primary purpose of this scheme, which is employee retention? Ultimately, helping businesses is also indirectly helping employees, so I am still glad that there is this scheme. Nevertheless, I hope the Ministry will consider the efficacy and timing issues of such disbursements to ensure they achieve maximum intended results.Next, property tax rebates have been a common offering in Budgets in times of uncertainty. While the intention is for commercial landlords to pass on the savings to their tenants, this is not guaranteed. Time is needed for landlord-tenant discussions to take place and then the administrative work involved to update the tenancy terms. Has any outreach been done in the past years to determine how much of the savings from the rebates are passed on to the tenants? Moreover, I think we can consider increasing the quantum of property tax rebates if the economy is projected to undergo a U-shaped or a slightly deeper U-shaped recovery.In light of the difficulties experienced across many sectors, we have to ensure that the continued shift away from employment of foreign workers is also conducted in a sustainable manner. This is especially so for sub-sectors or firms which (a) have a high reliance on foreign workers, (b) are facing external headwinds from the earlier global economic tensions, and (c) are now further burdened by COVID-19 pressure on margins.Will it be possible to introduce a waiver of the Foreign Worker Levy for the five directly affected sectors as well as other industries which are not doing so well? I also hope more can be done to support sectors directly affected by COVID-19.An example is the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme which was introduced to the tourism industry. Can we also consider this for the other four directly affected sectors? I observe that the current measures are focused on retention and re-training of workers. But if the business fails to pick up or if businesses are unable to revise their business model, it is only a matter of time before they have little choice but to let go of workers.Deputy Prime Minister, in the alternate worse-case scenario of a protracted global pandemic situation, can you share with us if we have enough to undertake an off Budget package if needed to help businesses and workers?Mr Speaker, my second topic is on targeted assistance for those in the 40s and 50s group. I was extremely delighted to hear the Deputy Prime Minister mention in the Budget that he has introduced a SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package for locals in their 40s and 50s to help them stay employable and move on to new jobs or new roles. The Deputy Prime Minister has highlighted the aim to double the annual job placement of locals in their 40s and 50s to around 5,500 by the year 2025 via increasing the capacity of re-skilling programmes such as the Professional Conversion Programme under the Adapt and Grow initiative, plus other sector-specific and career transition programmes. I am in this 40 to 50 age group, so I hopefully will benefit from some of this.It is good to know also that employers will be supported to recruit, retain and re-train our local mid-career workers, so I strongly support the effort to increase the capacity of re-skilling programmes such as the Professional Conversion Programme by 2025. This, in my view, is pertinent, because a skills-restructuring exercise is very important for Singapore in this transition phase that we are facing. So, can we hasten and intensify the efforts on this and to focus a bit more to provide more targeted help for those who are in their 40s and 50s and provide incentives for companies to absorb more of them into the Professional Conversion Programmes, which wealready had, but we can actually widen a bit more and focus them in a faster way.Many existing SkillsFuture programmes require employees to be employed and nominated by their employers. For those who are not employed by a participating company, they sign up and hope they are shortlisted. As with the typical job applications, there is no guarantee. It is not unreasonable to believe most companies will put their interests before anything else and that could mean choosing an applicant who is perceived to have greater potential, someone with better qualifications, younger and so on. This may result in the more vulnerable groups, the ones who need the training and re-skilling most, left in the lurch.Last year, I proposed in my Adjournment Motion to the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) and MOM to enhance the Capability Transfer Programme (CTP) to incentivise companies to train more of their local workforce by sending them for training overseas or have them trained under a foreign specialist with the aim of transferring or sharing the new job scope. Companies should build their 40s to 50s Singaporean Core through this programme. Their experience in the workforce along with excellent work ethics make them exemplary employees to invest resources in. I hope this can still be considered by the Government, going forward.COVID-19 also underscores the vulnerability of income sustainability for 40 to 50s gig and contract workers. Freelancers across various industries are also affected, from trainers whose class attendances are slashed, to event organisers, emcees, photographers whose events are cancelled and so on. If COVID-19's impact lasts longer than projected, a second round of stimulus may be required to provide more direct help to these individuals.Regardless, job retrenchment and job transitions are inevitable. Besides current measures, how can we better support in these situations? How do we develop our people so they seize opportunities in this fast-changing economy? For every success story of someone who discovered their new calling, there are others who feel discouraged from months of seeking.Mr Speaker, my third topic –cost of living.Cost of living is a perennial concern even amongst middle-class Singaporeans. Over the years, the Government has come up with new measures, raised income ceilings, provided relief to the sandwiched middle-class who have children and elderly to take care of. But in this climate of uncertainty, the current measures may be insufficient.One major concern is inflation. Singapore imports more than 90% of our food. Climate change and natural disasters around the world threaten our food security. With demand exceeding supply, this drives up food prices everywhere. Since 2013, food prices have gone up by about 10%, while 2019 saw the fastest increase in food prices in a decade. COVID-19 brings about many knock-on effects. With the Singapore dollar hitting a three-year low against the US dollar and weakening against regional currencies,costs of our imports will go up. Shippingcosts too are going up due to logistical difficulty in shipping out supplies from China. And with sudden waves of COVID-19 infection in certain countries resulting in city lockdowns, people are panicking and stockpiling food and necessities. I fear this may also contribute to further price increases in our food and essentials.In a typical middle income family, both husband and wife work, so most Singaporeans would dine out and order delivery. Higher rentals and labourcosts as well as increased water and electricity bills, have all led to increased operatingcosts. With prices of food and food services going up, a typical sandwiched middle income family can certainly feel the pinch from feeding their children, especially those with larger families.Many parents have shared with me that one of their greatest concerns is paying for their children's tertiary education. So, Primary and Secondary education in Singapore are indeed extremely affordable, but the same cannot be said for Universities and Polytechnics, where tuition fees and textbooks are hefty. There are bursaries and scholarships, both from the Government and community, but availability and eligibility are limited.Healthcare too is a natural concern. Today's sandwiched generation are worried about the healthcarecosts of their elderly parents. Despite all the existing measures and schemes to keep healthcarecosts affordable even for the very poor, it is apparent that healthcarecosts will keep going up with the increased demand for better-skilled healthcare workers and medical equipment and pricing power of the pharmaceutical companies.So, the announced $1.6 billion Care and Support Package provides assurance and support to Singaporean households during this period of uncertainty, by helping to defray some of their household expenses via various cash outlays, special workfare payments and others. So, it is a substantial amount for a large number of Singaporeans.But beyond these, can the Government share how it will mitigate rising livingcosts or the perception of it, so that Singaporeans will feel assured to build and grow their families? One avenue that comes to mind is to ensure that we have adequate measures for a start to monitor as a whole-of-Government to ensure prices of food, necessities and energy-related products do not see profiteering and asymmetric price adjustments that could affect general households during periods of crisis or shocks. The asymmetric price adjustments is quite key because sometimes, you adjust prices lower and sometimes, you adjust prices higher. But typically, when you adjust prices lower, energy companies tend to take a lag effect. So, besides the MTI-related workgroup and committees, CASE and Competition Commission of Singapore (CCCS) looking at profiteering, can we set up a single enforcement unit to address profiteering and price adjustment asymmetries in a more sustained manner or embed it more explicitly to address inefficient pricing practices within the CCCS mandate? Mr Speaker, in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Income inequality. In the midst of all the worrying news about COVID-19 and rising economic uncertainties, there is a silver lining. A Department of Statistics' Key Household Income Trends report states that household income inequality here last year was at its lowest in almost two decades.The improvement over time is commendable. Our key strategy to ensure access to good education opportunities for all, has likely contributed significantly to this. There has been heavy investment in education, and more recently, in early education, with deliberate effort to level the playing field at the early stage.But we must not rest on our laurels. Today, there are still vulnerable people who require support to gain access to nutritious food, healthcare and even shelter. We read about them in the news, we hear about them from social service organisations, we see them at the Meet the People sessions. Labels like \"high SES\" and \"low SES\" are being bandied around. We are familiar with the stereotypes applied to different aspects of life in Singapore, from what sport we play to the food that we eat. Our society is becoming increasingly status-conscious, and we need to put a stop to this. We need to prevent an underclass from forming.Plenty has been said and done about empowering people through education and skills-upgrading. The fact remains that there are many amongst the low-income group who are in low-wage jobs with little career prospects and wage growth. Due to family circumstances, such as care-giving duties or being in ill health, some of them are simply unwilling or unable to sink additional time and energy into attending courses. Yet the only way forward is through renewed opportunities and upskilling.One way is to redesign or change these jobs, and this is already done through automation. The other way is to develop workers to switch career paths. However, we need targeted help and hand-holding to make renewing opportunities possible for the vulnerable.Some social enterprises create job opportunities for the vulnerable. I have no doubt that they too are affected by COVID-19. Given the nature of their business model, they may be harder hit than other businesses, as are their workers, if they have to be let go during this period. Has the Government done any outreach to social enterprises to find out what kind of assistance they need? How effective have social enterprises been in offering sustainable and stable employment to the vulnerable group? Can the Government work more closely with social enterprises to uplift this vulnerable group?(In English): Mr Speaker, in conclusion, the best laid-out plans need a sound and sustainable fiscal strategy. The challenges facing Singapore in the 10 years ahead will grow in complexity. We will need all Singaporeans to come alongside to find solutions to these challenges and chart a new course for the future.It is reassuring that the Minister has committed expenditures beyond COVID-19 to measures ensuring our sustainability – short, medium and long term. I am confident that with the Government, businesses and the people working together and playing our part to support one another, we will pull through the challenges together, stronger and better than before. I support the Budget.5.38 pmMr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will start with our response to the COVID-19 crisis. First, most Singaporeans are heartened by the speed and scale of our initial economic response. The pressing issue now is effective implementation of the short-term economic package and a dynamic response as the crisis unfolds.Effective implementation requires all parties to partner with one another, in the spirit of SG Together. We must also respond dynamically as events unfold. A prolong U-shape economic situation is becoming more likely. Why?When major societies manage the pandemic in a decisive, clear and transparent way, the economic impact is limited to a short-term supply shock as well as deferred demand, all leading to a V-shape rebound.On the other hand, if major economies fail to implement containment and mitigation efforts, widespread fear and uncertainty will trigger a second level economic impact leading to a U-shape scenario. Governments will need to coordinate economic responses within and beyond their borders. And if a coordinated economic response fails, in an extreme scenario, global economic contagion could happen.The global financial markets are starting to price in a U-shape scenario. Investors are beginning to wonder: in the US, with the upcoming Presidential elections, can the Democrat-held House of Representative and the Trump administration, partner effectively on healthcare and fiscal responses? And also, if Northern Europe can mitigate a pandemic more effectively than Southern Europe, will the former want to bear the burden of a large EU fiscal response?It is still too early to tell. Nevertheless, businesses, and many of them from my constituency, would like to contribute ideas on how we can implement effectively, and respond dynamically.One, for the next 12 months, MOF, MTI and MOM can have monthly meetings with the key Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) and unions. Key areas to track include bank-lending levels by sector and company size; short-term grant utilisation and efforts to help affected workers. This allows for dynamic response.For example, if companies withhold wage across the board, there could be less take-up on the Enhanced Wage Credit scheme. Could we then, perhaps, re-deploy funds to other short-term measures, so as to achieve the intended positive fiscal impulse?Two, some companies in badly affected sectors hope for more assistance in a prolong downturn. Some ideas – IRAS can also consider implementing the Jobs Support Programme for them immediately.Some deeply impacted companies are asking for a short-term waiver of the Foreign Worker Levy. If we do so, our objective must be to protect the jobs of the Singaporeans in these companies.Also, during SARS, STB prepared an excellent marketing campaign, so that we were one of the first to pitch for tourism when travel resumed. Even as things look bleak for the tourism today, we can do similar preparations.Three, our banks must live up to the social and moral responsibility to lend to viable companies, especially now that the Government has done its part to take on more default risk.Many banks are digitalising their relationship and risk management approach. In fact, many smaller SMEs with me that they no longer know who are their champions within their banks, which is critical during tough times. Our Singapore banks have a strong reputation of being responsible in supporting viable companies during tough times. Now is the time for them to earn that reputation for many more years to come.Four, MAS can consider accelerating the banking licensing process for new entrants, if they can bring different perspectives on credit-worthiness, for example, through supply chain and data analytics so that more viable firms can benefit.Five, some foreign workers are thinking of returning home. After the Little India riot, I saw first hand how our frontbench went systematically to major dormitories to calm the ground. Our TACs, businesses, the Government and unions can consider doing something similar. And also, if there is an exodus of foreign workers from any particular country, perhaps MOM can consider temporarily expanding the countries our firms hire from.And lastly, some Singaporeans are wondering if there will be a second economic package. Could MOF share the likely criterion to determine if a second package is needed, and the considerations and determinations on the scale and scope of further actions?I also hope the TACs leaders, who are usually respected elders in their industry, play the difficult role to counsel owners, when their business are no longer viable and on how to move forward, so that they can seek social assistance early and move quickly to new opportunities, before their finances deteriorate beyond the point of no return.Next, I would like to speak on MOH's and the taskforce's exceptional response to the coronavirus.I recently ran into my family GP of many years. Like many Singaporeans, he commended MOH for the excellent response so far. He shared that during SARS, we had limited medical resources – CDC 1 was a pre-war building and CDC 2 was a converted ward. Today, we have an excellent system, with a state-of-the-art NCID at the heart of it.Well-informed foreign investors also shared with me that should a global pandemic happen, Singapore is best placed regionally to weather the storm.I am also heartened to see MOH's additional $800 million of funding, on top of the large post-SARS investments. As a comparison, the US is seeking additional funding of US$1.2 billion for their CDC, for a population of 300 million. Clearly, our Government spares no expenses when it comes to protecting the lives of Singaporeans!With globalisation and climate change, we must expect more pandemics. Yet, over the years, the global healthcare supply chain has become overly lean for even crucial healthcare essentials.According to WHO, the widespread inappropriate use of face masks and protective suits globally by those not at the frontline caring for patients, further contributed to the unexpected shortage and price surge.Therefore, changing global circumstances require us to do an immediate review of our medical stockpile and resilience policy, both for basic drugs and medical disposables commonly used in pandemics.If necessary, we should anchor relevant manufacturers in Singapore on strategic and not purely economic considerations. And if that is not possible, we can explore pre-position materials and manufacturing capabilities within Singapore.Next, developing our Singaporeans. We are making wonderful progress for our seniors to age with purpose and dignity. Our urgent task now is to strengthen the employability of mid-career Singaporeans, especially in a protracted downturn. Here are some suggestions.First, I hope mid-career Singaporeans will fully embrace the SkillsFuture NextCareer Package, now that they have an additional 1,000 dollars credit. I also hope to see stronger publicity by all for SkillsFuture.Second of all, I hope some industries and TACs can step up.  A sector is more viable if the companies actively steer industry development.  Some industries have yet to come up with compelling visions, despite the additional help that the Government has provided to TACs. Without a compelling vision, Singaporeans will struggle to identify meaningful paths for upskilling within those sectors. If things do not move in some of these sectors, I hope the existing companies and Government can partner to create alternative TACs to drive industry development. Too many jobs, especially from mid-career Singaporeans, are at risk if we do not do this transformation well.Lastly, in a protracted downturn, I hope the Government can actively work with certain established industries to absorb more mid-career Singaporeans. These include the construction, engineering services, healthcare, social work, which usually face difficulty recruiting Singaporeans. Companies can tap on MOM's many excellent initiatives to attract Singaporeans. I also hope that affected Singaporeans will also keep an open mind for these jobs. Yes, career transitions are hard. But I am confident that Singaporeans will rise to the occasion.And if things do not move, I hope the Government can consider further DRC reduction for these specific sectors, and implement the Fair Consideration Framework vigorously. Tough actions could be necessary. Because our sectors that usually absorb mid-career Singaporeans –whether they are heartland enterprises, the IRs, airport, hospitality and private hire transportations – may not be able to do so now. We must give our mid-career Singaporeans the best fighting chance to stay employed.Beyond current concerns, we must also look out on longer-term trends. I hope our House, as a whole, can start tracking developments on the Base Erosion and Profit Sharing (BEPS).Our tax incentives for income within and beyond Singapore are important tools to anchor major investments in Singapore.The G-20 has turned on the pressure on hub economies such as Singapore, Switzerland and Hong Kong. Singapore has weathered Phase One of BEPS well through quick adjustments.But there is a Phase Two coming, along two dimensions.One, EU and UK want a cut of their own citizen’s e-commerce revenue, even though existing rules dictate that tax revenue should largely reside in locations generating economic activities. The US currently stands in the way of this proposal, as they benefit from e-commerce. But one cannot rule out a future compromise, to the detriment to hub economies.Two, some major developed economies are pushing for a minimal global tax. So that they can tax their companies more, even if companies get a preferential tax rate elsewhere, regardless of the justification.If these developments take place, the impact on our revenue base could be swift and sizable. Billions of dollars of lost corporate income tax; additional spending to keep and attract current and future investments; loss tax revenue and spending by a reduced international workforce; and less job opportunities for our people.I hope that within this Chamber, as we discuss about meeting current and future needs, we can keep in mind the possibility of a sudden revenue drop.Let me now conclude. In troubled times like this, we can see the mettle of a country's governance system. Yes, Singapore is undoubtedly the canary bird for globalisation. Pandemics, trade wars, terrorism, climate change, fake news can hit Singapore hard and fast.Nevertheless, the world can expect Singapore, in the spirit of SG Together, to emerge stronger from every crisis. Because they know the hallmark of Singapore, is our ability to implement effectively and respond dynamically to short-term, medium-term and long-term challenges all at the same time. With that, I stand in support of the Budget.Mr Speaker: Mr Douglas Foo.5.49 pmMr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member): Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me to declare my interest as Chairman of Sakae Holdings Limited, President of the Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF), Vice-Chairman of the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and Vice-President of the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF).I rise to affirm my support for the recently delivered Singapore Budget Statement 2020 and to provide a response from the manufacturing and business community.The general sentiment from the manufacturing and business community is that this is a Budget that recognises the current challenging local and global economic climate and which seeks to provide for a better short to medium term economic future for Singapore.In this regard, as one of the local Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs), and as one which represents an important contributor to Singapore's Gross Domestic Product, the SMF wishes to state unequivocally that it will stand united and work with other TACs and Government agencies to drive our businesses through the current challenging times and forge better futures for enterprises. We stand ready to assist wherever we can and will do our utmost best to prepare our members to be in the best possible condition to take advantage of the opportunities that will come with the upturn of the economic cycle.Mr Speaker, Sir, I will divide my speech today largely into two parts – one of the relief measures and one of business capability enhancements.Relief Measures. In relation to the relief measures for COVID-19 announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng, the feedback is that many are glad that attention is given to both enterprises and to individual workers.Wage relief in the form of the New Jobs Support Scheme and the Enhanced Wage Credit Scheme, as well as, enterprise cash-flow relief in the form of Corporate Tax Rebates and enhancement of the Enterprise Financing Scheme, will go some way towards assuaging society’s fear of lost livelihoods and shuttered enterprises.The SMF is also glad that the Government has taken on board the feedback from our members and stated that Government landlords are willing to exercise some form of flexibility with rentals during this difficult time.However, while the above is indeed welcomed, the community wishes that Deputy Prime Minister can consider going further by providing a more structured framework for rental relief which provides for more immediate relief directly to the tenants, rather than through the landlords. This would aid businesses greatly by allowing them some degree of certainty in adjusting their budget amidst the current climate of uncertainty.Another aspect which is causing much anxiety and worry for the manufacturing and business community is that of the disruption of the world-wide supply chain. As manufacturers, the worry is two-fold: one, the difficulty of attaining raw materials; and, secondly, even if products can be manufactured, how would goods reach the customers. This would, in turn, affect the manufacturing service providers downstream.Sir, while our members appreciate that there is no easy common solution across the different industries, there is hope that the Government will extend a further helping hand by suspending or waiving the collection of foreign worker levies during this period for existing work permit holders.In a recent dialogue session with members from the SMF family, there are many who voiced real and genuine concerns over the current economic conditions. However, many are optimistic that the economy will start to show signs of recovery six months from now. It would therefore be commensurating with such expectations and hope that relief measures factor in an efficacy timeline of between six months to a year.Next, deepening business capabilities. In relation to preparing our businesses and economy for the future, the SMF is extremely heartened that feedback from our members has been acknowledged by Deputy Prime Minister Heng in the Budget speech. The SMF has always prided itself on being a collaborative TAC, working with the Government as well as commercial entities to broaden and open new opportunities for our members.It is pertinent to note that Deputy Prime Minister Heng mentioned in his speech the hope that Singapore companies digitalise and internationalise. The SMF strongly believes in exploring new frontiers, which refers not just to new physical geographical locations, but also to the very much evolving digital realm.I have always communicated to our business leaders which I have the privilege of meeting, that digitalisation is important for both society and businesses to advance further than what Singapore is today. It is ever important that as the cyber world progresses, Singapore cannot be left behind as a third world nation or even as a developing nation because the speed of progression is simply too rapid.In this regard, I am happy to share with this House that the SMF has already embarked on several programmes, working alongside the Government, to encourage our members to transform, innovate their business models towards Industry 4.0 and explore new frontiers.These corporate transformational programmes include: conducting hands-on knowledge and capability building courses at our Centre for Corporate Learning,  leading business missions to both local and overseas markets, organising Free Trade Agreement talks and seminars and being the first TAC to administer the SMEs-Go Digital – Digital Project Management Service.Where workforce transformation and training is concerned, the SMF has recently created a course to help businesses examine their business models and identify ways of changing these models towards Industry 4.0. We are focusing on facilitating mid-career switches and is the first Programme Manager for the Professional Conversion Programme (Broad-based) to achieve 1,000 placements. We also seek to attract young talent into the manufacturing community by being on board the Global Ready Talent Programme.Mr Speaker, Sir, such initiatives reflect the commitment of the Federation in supporting our members and comes from the dedication of the staff. This is what I like to say, is an example of how individuals coming together, which is aligned with SG Together movement, driven by a common aim, can indeed make a difference.The commitment by the Government to allocate $8.3 billion in this Budget to drive Singapore’s transformation and growth strategy is indeed heartening as it will continue to support the work and initiatives of TACs. It is my sincere hope that other TACs will also join in and work together in a concerted effort to drive our economy onwards and upwards.One concern which the manufacturing community has from Deputy Prime Minister Heng's speech is that of the superseded decrease in the Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) for the manufacturing sector. The community is relieved that the Government has prudently decided not to implement such a measure in such difficult times. However, there is always an innate and recurring fear of the shortage of suitable local manpower.It is the community’s hope that if and when the Government decides to effect the decrease in the DRC for the manufacturing sector, more lead time can be given for our members to prepare and plan ahead.Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, this is a Budget that seeks to assist and encourage Singaporeans to do more for themselves and for the country. The wise leaders of generations past of this country have practised financial prudence which has allowed for such a generous and decisive Budget today.I humbly urge my fellow Singaporeans to not take this for granted. In such uncertain economic times, the ability of the Government still to seek to deepen capabilities at every stage of growth and provide for every segment of society is indeed laudable.I am confident that working together in unity as a united country, our Singapore flag will rise above all the uncertainty as a stronger, more resilient nation that will continue to thrive and succeed on the global stage. With this, Sir, I affirm my support for the Budget 2020.Mr Speaker: Mrs Josephine Teo.5.58 pmThe Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo): Mr Speaker, a grassroots leader shared with me how, during a previous downturn, his employer had rushed to trim its workforce by rolling out a Mutually Agreed Departure, or M-A-D scheme. Employees who signed up for the M-A-D scheme received generous payouts.Unexpectedly, less than a year later, business picked up again. Some of his former employees – the same ones who had received payouts under the M-A-D scheme – were rehired at their previous salaries and went on to work many more years.Now, we may laugh at the unfortunate name of the scheme and the apparent short-sightedness of the employer. But when business is down and the bottom nowhere in sight, it must cross the minds of bosses to cut jobs and savecosts.Fortunately, most employers have not done that. Last year, despite the uncertain outlook, retrenchments were maintained at 2018 levels.[Deputy Speaker (Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]Today, with the COVID-19 outbreak casting a pall, concerns have heightened. The recent announcements by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat therefore provide welcome relief.Of the $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package, a whopping 60% – $2.4 billion – will go towards the Jobs Support Scheme and the enhanced Wage Credit Scheme. All businesses with local employees will benefit.Jobs Support will provide companies an 8% cash grant based on the gross monthly wages of their local employees for three months, subject to a monthly wage cap of $3,600 per employee. This means that an SME with 10 local employees earning median salaries would get about $8,000 in Jobs Support. Over the next three months, the Government will inject about $1.3 billion to employers and help keep 1.9 million local employees in their jobs.With the greater sense of uncertainty, employers may hold back or even reverse wage increases. Through the enhanced Wage Credit Scheme, the Government will co-pay 20% of qualifying wage increases in 2019 and 15% of increases in 2020 if this higher wage is sustained. Effectively, more than four months of the wage increase is borne by the Government over two years. The enhanced Scheme has also raised the qualifying salary from $4,000 to $5,000, with $1.1 billion going to about 90,000 employers, benefiting more than 700,000 local employees.Why so much emphasis on jobs and wages? Neighbourhood stores have already noticed a sharp drop in revenues as shoppers cut back on spending. When livelihoods are at stake or incomes stagnate, even necessary spending on essentials like healthcare and education may be delayed. Individuals will also have limited capacity to upgrade their skills and stay relevant.Moreover, employers would need time to mobilise and train manpower. When the upturn comes, businesses could easily find themselves short-handed and unable to respond to opportunities. This will result in the drag on our business community persisting longer than necessary. The recovery will be slower.Understandably, besides jobs and wage support, businesses that hire foreign workers had hoped for levies to be waived. Members of Parliament like Mr Seah Kian Peng and Mr Arasu asked about it, too. We are waiving levies for employers whose foreign workers are required to serve quarantine, Leave of Absence or Stay-Home Notices when they have a travel history to China. But we have not done so for foreign workers in general because it will not benefit the many employers who only have local employees. At the same time, we have not raised levies either. In fact, levies have remained the same since 2017 for the construction sector and 2016 or earlier for other sectors.There are two other important reasons for not waiving levies. First, in supporting businesses, our priority was also to preserve local employment. Second, as much as we want to help businesses, measures to deal with the short-term fallout should not negate longer term efforts for companies to become less reliant on foreign manpower for growth. Levy waivers or reductions would have run counter to both objectives.In addition, after much careful consideration, we have announced forthcoming cuts in the S Pass quotas for construction, marine and process sectors, but we will give these sectors a longer period to adjust. Some commentators are troubled by the difficulty of attracting locals to these sectors. Others believe these moves are painful but necessary; they say it is \"tough love\". I thank Ms Sylvia Lim, for example, for supporting it.I should point out that, unlike for the services sector, the quota cuts for the construction, marine and process sectors are at the S Pass levels and not at the work permit levels. S Pass jobs are skilled jobs which Polytechnic graduates and even ITE upgraders are able to perform.Mr Saktiandi Supaat and several Members of Parliament asked that flexibility be provided to employers who find it difficult to attract Singaporeans to certain jobs. Today, employers can already enjoy short-term flexibility in meeting foreign workforce criteria under the Capability Transfer Programme and the Lean Enterprise Development Scheme. At a structural level, too, we recognise the differing appeal of sectors. In the construction sector, out of 100 employees, up to 87 can be foreigners, of which 15 can be S Pass holders, even after the changes kick in by 2023. A company in the services sector of the same size can have up to 35 foreign employees, of which 10 can be S Pass holders starting from January 2021.Beyond these gradations, we should be realistic. Which sub-sector or occupation will accept having more restrictions compared to others that have less? Looking at it from a different lens, which local employees would feel it is fair that their employers need not worry or try as hard to improve job quality to retain them because of more access to foreigners? Consider the longer term, too. Can we be so sure that foreigners will always accept the work conditions our own people find unappealing or that will they not find better jobs back home in time to come?For all these reasons, Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore has been working closely with agencies like the Building and Construction Authority to help employers reach out to fresh graduates as well as mid-career switchers. Employers, too, can help themselves by enhancing job quality and widening the pool of potential recruits. Mr Kenneth Loo, former President of the Singapore Contractors Association and Executive Director of Straits Construction, acknowledged this point and talked about the need to \"…try to make jobs more meaningful and attractive through digitalisation, so that processes can change and the environment will be more palatable to workers\".If I may suggest to Mr Douglas Foo, employers in the manufacturing sector should plan ahead, too. I hope that the Singapore Manufacturing Federation, of which he is the President, will help them to do so.These efforts to make jobs more attractive to skilled Singaporeans go hand-in-hand with an overall emphasis on business transformation. Waiving or cutting levies would blunt the motivation to restructure, improve job quality and become more manpower-lean. We would not have seen how industries can rise to the occasion. The hotel industry is an excellent example.One lunar new year about a decade ago, when I was still serving as a labour Member of Parliament, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong visited a leading hotel to thank the workers for sacrificing time with family to give tourists a great guest experience. Sensing an opportunity not to be missed, the hotel's general manager literally ambushed the Prime Minister and gave an extended presentation on the hotel's manpower woes. I am not sure whether the Prime Minister remembers it.The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong): Yes. [Laughter.]Mrs Josephine Teo: As in many sectors, he cited the unappealing nature of work and asked for \"flexibility\".In contrast, my visit to Copthorne King's Singapore Hotel last Friday was a breath of fresh air. Our main purpose had been to understand how the hotel was coping with the sharp fall in occupancy due to the COVID-19 situation. General Manager Kung Teong Wah, however, took delight to also outline the many ways in which work had been redesigned to raise productivity, easier and more satisfying for his employees.For example, housekeepers no longer waste time knocking on doors to figure out which room was ready to be cleaned and are instead notified through a mobile app. The mobile app is linked to an in-room control unit which also turns off electrical power when guests have left the room and alerts facilities managers when light bulbs or other amenities need fixing. Bedding was changed so that it takes 20% less time to tidy up each room. A new vacuuming system has halved the time to get the job done. Cross-training of staff to handle expanded job roles have led to manpower savings, better wages and increased job satisfaction. Even the cleaner I met, 58-year-old Pari, is happy that the washroom renovations and upgrading of cleaning solutions will help him to work more years.As a matter of fact, in the last few years, I have witnessed the resolve and creativity of hoteliers to overcome their manpower constraints. Yotel at Orchard Road allows guests to check-in themselves easily and get items delivered by a friendly robot. Andaz Hotel no longer has a team of confectioners in its kitchen. Instead, it keeps customers happy with supplies from Tiong Bahru Bakery and cleverly brands this as part of the heritage experience for guests. Lyf at Funan replaced the usual laundry services with a hipster corner where guests can chill out while the washing machine does its job.These transformations have not always been easy. But they also show how important it is for us to stay the course and not give up too easily. Productivity has improved greatly in some sectors, but not fully caught up with the best in the world.Instead of levy reductions or waivers, we have put together a multi-agency support package worth more than $15 million that also involves our tripartite partners, for businesses in the tourism sector to use the downtime for more training and transformation. Likewise, for other sectors, we should try our best to position ourselves for the future even when the chips are down. This is exactly why we have focused on Jobs Support and Wage Credits, so that businesses and their people can continue with operations and press on with restructuring with help from the Enterprise Transformation Package.At this juncture, allow me to commend the tremendous efforts of the NTUC in support of these aims. Starting with Secretary-General Mr Ng Chee Meng, labour Members of Parliament have outlined specific initiatives like the Company Training Committees and the Jobs Security Council. MOM, MOE and MTI and all the lead agencies for the relevant sectors will certainly work closely with unions in the spirit of SG Together to make it a success for businesses in terms of their transformation for the benefit of all workers.Ms Sylvia Lim asked whether these efforts will be enough and whether unemployment insurance will be needed. This is not a new suggestion. In fact, we had discussed this in Parliament extensively in May 2017. Countries with unemployment insurance typically have persistently high unemployment. In contrast, Singapore has consistently had full employment. Willingness to pay for unemployment insurance is not the same as most people do not expect to need it and also have other buffers, for example, a working spouse or child. While we keep an open mind on unemployment insurance, we should also be aware of its serious downsides, such as reducing employers' willingness to pay retrenchment benefits.Studies have also found that unemployment benefits can have the unintended consequence of reducing motivation to find work. Our current approach of focusing on employment support has shown encouraging results and is likely to be more sustainable.As Mr Lim Swee Say has pointed out, Singapore's way of managing the opportunities and challenges of globalisation has produced not just economic growth but, more importantly, employment and wage growth. As long as jobs are still being created, our focus on employment support helps both individuals and businesses. We will continue to provide short-term financial relief to the needy. Programmes like Adapt and Grow and SkillsFuture help workers reskill and seize better opportunities in the longer term. This approach has the full support of the unions and employers which other countries find harder to do.As to the question of using CPF monies to fund reskilling, the key question is whether the lack of training funds is the main bearer to career transitions. The Government directly subsidises a very wide range of training programmes, up to 90% in some instances. To fund the unsubsidised portion of reskilling or self-improvement courses, Singaporeans have access to workplace sponsorships and schemes, such as SkillsFuture, Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy and the Workfare Training Support. At present, it does not appear that the lack of funds is a significant barrier. As Ms Sylvia Lim herself has also acknowledged, we are redoubling support to both employers and individuals. The employers can now access SkillsFuture Enterprise Credits up to $10,000 while the employees themselves have SkillsFuture Credit top-ups.I suggest that we focus on these initiatives instead of putting at risk the Retirement Savings of our people. At the same time, focus on issues that matter to mid-career persons which Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Ms Jessica Tan and several labour Members of Parliament talked about.Mr Deputy Speaker, with your permission, I will say a few words in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Mr Deputy Speaker, of the $4 billion Stability and Support Package in this year's Budget, 60% of the funds will be used to help Singaporeans retain their jobs. It demonstrates the Government’s resolve to help businesses and workers ride out the challenges amidst economic uncertainties.Focusing on helping Singaporeans retain their jobs and providing Wage Credit so that businesses can maintain the momentum of transformation, will have a profound impact on our economy when it recovers.Amidst economic uncertainties, some businesses that employ foreign workers might ask, why does MOM not reduce or even waive foreign workers levies? The fact is that since 2016, levies have not been raised for vast majority of sectors.Apart from that, levies are waived for employees under Leave of Absence, Stay-Home Notice or Quarantine Order.We do not intend to reduce or waive the foreign workers levy across the board because of two key reasons.First, as the saying goes, those who do not plan for the future will find trouble on their doorstep. Although we want to help companies ride out the current economic uncertainties smoothly, we also hope that companies will sustain their transformation efforts and thereby reduce reliance on foreign workers.Second, we must first and foremost ensure that all Singaporeans can keep their jobs. Hence, from the long-term point of view, companies must quicken the pace of transformation, improve productivity and create more jobs to attract Singaporeans.As a whole, our measures must take into account two sets of considerations: reducing businesscosts in the short term, and keeping up with transformation efforts over the longer term.I am heartened to see that many companies are planning to use this lull period to send their employees for training. I think these companies have an eye on the future, because once the economy picks up, they will be in the forefront of the starting line and raring to go, and they would be able to take their businesses to greater heights.(In English): Mr Deputy Speaker, in the meantime, even with all the help provided, I acknowledge that some businesses may still have to manage access manpower. Is there a right way of doing it? Yes, but let me tell you of one wrong way. An employer claimed she was recently told by MOM to lay off employees much against her own wishes. This sounded really odd to me. Well, it turns outthe employer did not tell the full story.In fact, she had decided to shut operations temporarily and told her workers to go on no pay leave until further notice. It is unfortunate if she has to close even with Jobs Support and Wage Credits. But asking the workers to bear the uncertainty of waiting for her business to re-start, makes matters worse. For those workers without savings, they will need other jobs to pay their bills. It is one thing to ask if her employees would like to volunteer for no pay leave; it is quite another to force it upon them.As the employer had stopped paying salaries, it would also not have been fair to expect her foreign workers to stay in Singapore with limited means of supporting themselves. Instead of seeking levy waivers, MOM advised her that it would be more appropriate to repatriate the foreign workers responsibly and to reapply for work permits in future when business picks up.In fact, the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment recommends other options besides no-pay leave and layoffs. This could include redeployment to other work areas, shorter work weeks, job sharing or adjustments to certain wage components. These options would at least maintain most, if not all of the workers' past incomes.For employers with excess foreign workers, the Singapore Business Federation will also administer a temporary scheme to help the workers be transferred to employers with manpower shortages. This will help employers whose Chinese workers have not gotten approval to return to Singapore and also cannot hire new Chinese workers because we have suspended approvals.I am heartened to see that businesses are paying attention. In their own ways, they are responding to these challenging times in the spirit of SG together. Some are asking their workers to clear their annual leave or time-off. Others are exploring shorter work-weeks while sending their workers for skills upgrading.NTUC Health Co-operative shared with me that this virus situation has sparked a viral interest amongst its workers in leveraging technology for alternative work arrangements. Almost overnight, even if they are mature workers who were struggling to pick up digital tools, had found ways to hang out and engage in discussions virtually with their younger colleagues. Kudos to the companies that are proactively considering such sensible measures – not just to cutcosts, but to save jobs as well.Mr Deputy Speaker, next week, I will say more about support for self-employed persons and how we can tackle medium-term challenges though the SkillsFuture Mid-career Support Package and the Senior Worker Support Package. This is our commitment to Singaporeans in their 40s and 50s – that they too, can have an extended runway; and that everyone, at every stage of life, will get the fair chance they deserve to grow and progress at work. After all, every worker matters. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Budget.[Applause.]Mr Deputy Speaker: Yes, Ms Sylvia Lim.6.22 pmMs Sylvia Lim: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I have two clarifications for the Minister. First, it is regarding my suggestion on the use of CPF. I have actually filed a cut in the MOM Committee of Supply (COS), so please let me elaborate more at the time, and I will be interested to hear Minister's response then.The second clarification is that I am glad to note Minister saying the Government still keeps an open mind on solutions including insurance. On the ground, we are getting some feedback that mid-career professionals who try to tap on the existing Adapt and Grow Schemes; some of them are still finding difficulties getting a job after some time. So, how confident is the Government moving forward that you will be able to handle and find solutions for everyone who applies under those schemes?Mrs Josephine Teo: Mr Deputy Speaker, I am very conscious of the concerns that some of our mid-career professionals have expressed. I understand their anxieties and they matter very much to me.Not long ago, MOM published a report which shows over the last 10 years what the employment outcomes have been for PMETs. We looked at it, at the level of all local PMETs. We looked at it also at the level of all citizen PMETs. So, it is quite a comprehensive report and it is publicly available. I think it was also quite well reported in the media.We do not take the improved employment outcomes of our citizens for granted. It is not a given. We have to work very hard for it. In fact, in the last Parliament sitting, actually, I think it was the same Parliament sitting that Deputy Prime Minister Heng delivered the Budget Statement. Mr Pritam Singh had filed a question specifically on how we are helping these PMETs enter into areas of job growth, enter into occupations that they may have been unfamiliar with. The results that we have so far are quite encouraging.How will the situation evolve? I think our approach in handling this challenge is to go at it from different angles. First, it is really important to sustain the momentum of job creation. If the engine for job creation goes flat, all bets are off. Which is why in terms of how we think for enterprise growth, enterprise transformation, because ultimately it is businesses that create jobs. We are very mindful to help make sure that they can upkeep a certain momentum. We are very focused on that. So, the first thing to do is that we must always keep creating jobs and not just any jobs, but good jobs. That is the first thing.What that means is that you need to keep ensuring that the business environment is pro-business. Mr Lim Swee Say earlier talked about the importance of Artificial Intelligence. I think it is Artificial Intelligence plus many other domains where we want to make sure that our businesses will be able to develop a competitive edge in. So, that is the most important foundation for ensuring good employment outcomes – PMETs and non PMETs.The second, I think, that is also very important is to maintain a sense of motivation on the part of individuals, to keep upskilling. For this, I find the attitudes of Singaporeans very commendable. Most people are very aware of it and they are personally invested in it. In fact, I think that is the reason why there have been so many calls consistently, \"Please top up our SkillsFuture Credits\" and so on.Third, it is important to keep promoting Fair Employment. Promotion of Fair Employment, letting businesses know that they have to keep recruitment open and to consider all candidates fairly and not discriminate anyone, particularly our locals, particularly those who are not necessarily so young anymore, I think that is also another very important part of the effort.So, you have the three things that are necessary. Then, at the same time, we also need to ensure that there is continued Government support for re-skilling and job creation. Those pieces, you need to have in place.Will there be individuals who still find difficulty? I acknowledge, there will always be. Mr Liang, earlier in his opening speech to kick-off the debate, highlighted how difficult it is to go through transition. The sense of insecurity, perhaps a sense of not being able to navigate. Ms Jessica Tan talked about it too. I think we are very cognisant of it. In the WSG as well as e2i, quite apart from doing job matching, we are very mindful that sometimes just getting jobseekers to a place where they are receptive to the different opportunities, that is also a very important part of the work. One significant barrier – I think much more so than the lack of funds for training – is that there is a concern about moving into new occupation, new sectors that individuals are unfamiliar with. So, how can we provide the scaffolding and the hand-holding to help people to make those transitions? That is very much a part of the effort.But the Member is right. There is MOMCOScoming up next week and we can speak more about that.Mr Deputy Speaker: Ms Irene Quay.6.28 pmMs Irene Quay Siew Ching (Nominated Member): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank Deputy Prime Minister Heng and his team for planning this comprehensive and strategic Budget, which aims to tackle a wide scope of upcoming challenges such as the gloomy economic outlook, further complicated by COVID-19.This Budget aims to provide Singaporeans with new job opportunities as well as care and support for those in need of financial and social assistance. Just as important, I admire the foresightedness and pro-activeness in safeguarding our future against the potential harm brought about by climate changes.The decisive move of providing financial assistance to help businesses, especially those heavily impacted by COVID-19, is also critical and timely. The Budget set aside to prepare our youths to be more globally ready through overseas exposure is also a step in the right direction. However, I would like to ask the effectiveness of the SkillsFuture credit top-up of $500 scheme for adult Singaporeans aged 25 and above and the special SkillsFuture credit top-up scheme for Singaporeans aged 40-60.May I know what is the percentage of the originally allocated funds that have been used so far and what is the participation rate across the nation over the years, especially for the individual participants? For those who have utilised the SkillsFuture Credit, what percentage has actually resulted in successful career switch or career progression?I believe that a one-time funding of $500 may not be sufficient in paying for a fully effective, upskilling course as lifelong learning requires continuous, on-going support. Furthermore, not everyone has the desire for upskilling and should there be much of these funds left unused, there will be misallocation and underutilisation of resources.While I understand that these courses are already highly subsidised, I am wondering would it be more effective to further subsidise it, but add a limit to the number of courses each individual can take up per year, instead of mass distribution of these funds? This would allow interested citizens to reap the full benefits of the subsidy while we continue to encourage those who are not to sign up.Secondly, while I support the financial assistance schemes such as ComCare and MediFund top-ups, which aim to provide support for our needy families, I am concerned about the central checks and governance that ensure appropriate utilisation of these funds.At this juncture, I would like to declare my interest as the President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore and the Head of Pharmacy at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital.As a healthcare professional working in public over the past 20 years, I foresee potential loopholes. For example, what is in place to prevent a MediFund applicant from going to different healthcare institutions seeking more-than-required medical supplies, nutritional supplements and medications? Can the applicant ask for waiver from the National Electronic Medical Record sharing, quoting Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) rights, to avoid detection? How can we tell if each claim is within reasonable limits and not excessive? And f there are excess claims, how are these re-channelled to help other needy patients and not inappropriately disposed of?There is a need to tighten how these funds are used to ensure that the taxpayers' money is spent appropriately. Without central audits and controls in place, there is a potential for misuse.Thirdly, Deputy Prime Minister Heng and Minister Teo spoke about foreign worker policy and the need to further restrict S Pass holders for the identified industries. While we agree that we should always put Singaporeans first and give them the best possible opportunities, but we know that there are jobs out there that are really challenging to find locals to take on. An example of healthcare-related jobs are pharmacy technicians, whose service is required 24/7, including public holidays and weekends. Although we have Polytechnics that specialise in training and educating diploma holders to support this pipeline of pharmacy technicians, most of our youngsters aspire to take on higher qualifications after their graduation, leaving a constant vacuum in the system. I am concern if this persists, pharmaceutical care for our patients will be significantly impacted.To overcome this long drought, pharmacists are actually standing in to take on pharmacy technicians' duties. This is extremelycost-inefficient, especially in view of rising healthcarecost, as we are not fully utilising their advanced skills and knowledge to serve our patients.I believe that service industries in other fields are also facing similar problems.While the Government may advocate for automation to improve productivity, there are situations where automation, for various reasons, is not feasible. In healthcare, a lot of frontline patient care activities require healthcare professionals to display empathy and compassion to each individual patient. Such duty of care simply cannot just be easily replaced by machines, and I think similar sentiments can apply to many service industries.As such, instead of a blanket policy to limit S Passes with minimal exceptions, I would still like to appeal for MOM to consider showing flexibility to employers trying to hire locally with failed attempts to turn to foreign workers.I believe that if we want to reserve jobs for Singaporeans, we should reserve jobs that they prefer – jobs with good career upside and work-life balance. And if the intent is to avoid over-reliance on foreign workers, then there is a need to ensure that the solutions provided to solve current problems are feasible – for example, if there is good headway with mid-career transition programmes\t– before we further cut S Pass quotas. Mr Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding the above, I stand to support the Budget.Mr Deputy Speaker: Minister Josephine Teo, go ahead.6.34 pmMrs Josephine Teo: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Can I provide a quick response to Ms Irene Quay. I understand where she is coming from, but can I just say that at today's stage of development for Singapore, especially when it comes to seeking productivity improvements and finding manpower savings in the Services sector, we have gone far beyond the idea of simply automating things. It is a much more sophisticated approach towards becoming more manpower-lean. I shared earlier the examples of hotels. Not all of them have to do with automation at all.Even in some areas where automation can play a part, it does not mean that we are asking companies in the Services sector to automate human interaction or automate the customer experience. I give you an example. In manufacturing, I visited a company making noodles. They make hokkien noodles that we eat, they make kuay teow that we also eat. So, I asked them, \"Where are you finding business opportunities?\" And they told me that one of the things that they discovered was that in F&B outlets, quite often, two staff spend two hours every day doing one thing: portioning out noodles that were delivered to the outlet in 3-kg packs into smaller portions of 150 grams. Why? Because at peak hours, when the customers start arriving in the restaurant in droves, you have no more time to do portioning. You must be able to cook very quickly. So, what do the restaurants do? They get two workers standing there – maybe around 10 o'clock, nine o'clock – and for two hours, they do nothing but portion out the noodles.So, he said, \"This is a business opportunity for me.\" The outlet has got a lot of manpower constraints, but actually this portioning can be done by the machine. Hokkien noodles are produced using the extrusion method. You extrude the noodles, then you cook it in a big pot of water and then you —Mr Deputy Speaker: Minister Josephine Teo, are you giving another speech or are you providing a very extended clarification?Mrs Josephine Teo: I apologise, but very quickly, let me just summarise. Actually, there are many of these things that are backroom. Retail outlets\t– same. Stock-taking\t– the customer does not care about you taking stock, taking note of inventory. So, we have gone far beyond automation. There are so many more things that we can do. And credit to the businesses – they are much more creative. I just want to share that with you. I hope that as the leader of your professional association, you can consider trying out these ideas too.Mr Deputy Speaker: Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap.6.37 pmMr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied): Sir, I will deliver my speech in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Sir, the theme for this year's Budget is a Unity Budget, or in our national language \"Bajet Perpaduan\". I welcome the efforts to provide more support to Singaporeans during a time when the people are facing the challenge of the COVID-19 outbreak.In this Budget, measures are taken so that the industries, businessmen and those affected with the current situation, are given help and support to mitigate their financial burden, and at the same time, help to maintain financial resilience in an increasingly gloomy economic outlook.Help and support are also provided for those affected in society so that they can rise up and rebuild their financial capabilities during the recovery phase. Such financial assistance and support are essential because it will make those affected feel that their needs and their future are looked after and not neglected, and this will eventually preserve and strengthen social unity.Sir, financial resilience is an important factor in preserving and strengthening social unity. This is seen in many studies where social class divide has an impact on social unity. This is because those who lead a disadvantaged life will feel dissatisfied, because while they have to go through a difficult life and there is no one looking after them, there are others who live a life of luxury.Sir, although financial resilience is important, what is more important and foremost in preserving and strengthening social unity is psychological resilience. Building and maintaining psychological resilience is no easy task, as it requires patience and sustained efforts. Building psychological resilience can only be achieved by inculcating positive thinking and values within society. We can all agree that any society that possesses strong psychological resilience will not easily crumble when going through challenging times like the one right now.Sir, in this speech, I will like to briefly touch on the importance of psychological resilience when undergoing challenging situations, and at the same time, how we can learn important lessons from a crisis.When any crisis happens to a nation, society, family and individual, it has always been good practice or good culture if some introspection or self-reflection was done on its causes and the lessons that can be gleaned from it.My experience as a family counsellor has taught me that we can choose whether we want to go through a crisis positively or negatively.If we choose to see the crisis from a positive aspect, we will be able to learn many lessons behind each episode, and conversely, if we choose to see it negatively, then there will be a lot of grievances, sadness, anger and even depression.This situation is best described through an analogy called \"The Eyes of a Fly\" and \"The Eyes of a Bee\".Sir, a fly, upon entering a garden full of fragrant flowers, will still look for something filthy to land on.On the other hand, when a bee flies into a place full of trash and other kinds of filth, it will still try to find a fragrant flower to land on.This analogy, to me, is the best example that can be used to guide us whenever we face an undesirable situation. We can choose whether we wish to view a situation using \"The Eyes of a Fly\" or \"The Eyes of a Bee\".Sir, when an undesirable situation happens, the question on everyone’s minds is usually what could have caused it? Whose fault caused this to happen? When looking for answers, finger pointing and accusations often take place.Finger pointing is one of the negative traits that can exist in a person. It is human nature to have such negative feelings, and while it is not wrong to have such feelings, it is definitely wrong when we express those feelings through remarks, words and actions that hurt the feelings of others and make them angry.Sir, it is worse when snide remarks are made by individuals who have a certain standing in society. Leaders in politics, community and organisations, including heads of households have a duty to set a good example so that those under them will follow their lead. As the bearer of this responsibility, a leader must be big hearted and view certain incidents with a sincere and compassionate heart. In doing so, a leader will be able to make a positive and objective assessment whenever an adverse incident takes place, and thus will be able to think about and work on ways to improve the situation as much as possible. This is no mean feat, but it is the duty of any leader to continue trying and developing the values that I mentioned earlier.Sir, lately we have seen and heard Singaporeans' reactions when faced with the challenge of the COVID-19 outbreak. Praises and words of encouragement have flooded social media channels and the mainstream media, directed towards fellow Singaporeans who are in the frontline in the fight against the COVID-19 virus outbreak. Healthcare workers like doctors, nurses, paramedics and other healthcare officers were honoured as heroes for carrying on with their duties sincerely and diligently even though they face the possibility of getting infected.It was amazing and heart-warming to hear about some food and beverage establishment owners coming forward to provide free food and drinks as a token of appreciation and support to those working in the frontline. We also witnessed wonderful efforts from Singaporeans who wish to contribute positively to promote community spirit by distributing free masks and hand sanitisers to the public. This is something that we can be proud of and it is touching.Sir, these are just some commendable examples of unity shown by Singaporeans. The unity on display in the situations I mentioned earlier is something positive that can ignite a community spirit that makes them stand united in the face of challenges.Unfortunately, Sir, there had also been some incidents that were less pleasant and could erode this spirit of unity. Several posts shared on social media channels showed incidents where healthcare workers received cynical comments and were treated poorly.Some members of the public also shared that they received sharp stares when they coughed or sneezed in public places. This is an unhealthy situation and it must stop.Sir, we have also seen certain Singapore citizens and residents who were so worried that they participated in panic buying due to their concern about food shortage, as soon as the Health Ministry change the DORSCON level from yellow to orange.This incident caused many people to make comments that rebuke and criticise, that described those who took part in panic buying as people who only think of themselves and as kiasu people. Many also gave their take on the reasons behind this situation. Some felt that panic buying was a reaction to a previous situation, where the stock of masks and hand sanitisers were depleted despite assurances by the Government that there are enough supplies of masks and asked Singaporeans not to worry.Sir, words that hurt feelings and are insulting should not be said by anyone, either by the people or the leaders.Accusations and finger pointing are unwarranted and may further aggravate the anxiety that was already there. These kind of negative actions like condemnations, criticisms and finger pointing will weaken psychological resilience and have an unhealthy impact on social unity.As a society, we must try to practise the following pearl of wisdom, that is, “It is Better to Stay Silent if One Does Not Have Anything Good To Say”.Sir, let us all, leaders and followers, including myself, do some self-reflection and introspection, and stop doing things that can worsen the situation. We should all take a constructive and positive approach. Avoid any finger pointing because as the saying goes 'When you point one finger at others, the rest of your fingers are pointing at yourself.\"Sir, it is true that the practice of advising one another, reminding others to be good and patient with others is a good practice that should be encouraged. This practice is a constructive effort that should be done at all levels of society in order to inculcate, preserve and strengthen psychological resilience so that social and national unity will not be shaken or become tainted during challenging times. Thank you, Sir.6.47 pmDr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio): Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity to speak on Budget 2020. This year's Budget is, indeed, generous, particularly with the Stabilisation and Support Package, which helps to mitigate current economic challenges, partly fueled by the COVID-19 public health situation.Employment and employability support measures are needed as jobs become more challenging to be created or retained. Hence, any form of support for both employers and employees to continue to hire and be hired, is very much welcome.For my speech on the Budget, I wish to speak on employment-related matters and will focus on three aspects: one, support for older workers to continue working; two, support for persons with disabilities or special needs to be employed and be financially independent; and three, flexi-work provisions and support.First, on support for older workers to continue working. As Singaporeans live longer and the proportion of older Singaporeans increase relative to younger residents, we have to make provisions and review our policies to ensure older Singaporeans can continue to stay actively employed and engaged in our society. The Government has done well in this and there are many initiatives, programmes and policies that have been revised and implemented to cater to this. Hence, I am heartened by the The Next Bound of SkillsFuture announced in this year's Budget, which will help provide Singaporeans with opportunities to develop to their fullest potential throughout life and not only when they are young.I laud the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package and the SkillsFuture Credit Top-up for Singaporeans in their 40s and 50s, which, essentially, means they get a total of $1,000 per person. Both initiatives will help older Singaporeans remain employable and provide opportunities for them to continue to learn and upskill.At this juncture, Mr Deputy Speaker, please allow me to speak in Malay.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]A part of this year's Budget is for the allocation and assistance to Singaporean senior workers as well as mature workers in Singapore. I welcome such allocation and support for workers.Therefore, I hope that our senior workers and mature workers will seize the opportunity to enhance their skills and continue training in their respective jobs and careers.Certainly, the journey and the effort towards upskilling and continuous training are not easy. It takes time, it requires determination and hard work, it requires more expenditure and it also involves personal sacrifice. However, this sacrifice will result in a wealth of benefits and opportunities that will be enjoyed in the future – the chance for job promotion, job opportunities or a higher pay, as well as growing our self-worth. As the saying goes \"You have to undergo hardship and difficulties before you can enjoy the fruits of your labour\". And let us not give up too easily if things get tough when undergoing upskilling and continuous training – as the saying goes, “In for a penny, in for a pound”.At the same time, we must also acknowledge that the times are changing rapidly and we cannot ignore the impact of disruptive technologies, as well as economic transformations that have and will change the way we work or do business. Therefore, we must be ready to ride through this inevitable change.Mr Deputy Speaker, I will continue in English.(In English): I also laud the Senior Worker Early Adopter Grant and the Part-time Re-employment Grant that will help companies and employers review their hiring policies to help older workers stay employed. I look forward to the details of these two initiatives during MOM's Committee of Supply debate.While numerous provisions, schemes, grants and initiatives have been introduced, implemented and led by the Government and Government agencies, employers need to also do their part to facilitate the training, continued employment and contributions of older workers in Singapore. For a start, the jobs that older workers do have to be meaningful and cannot simply be menial work that younger Singaporeans shun.Taking on the role of mentors, trainers, coaches or supervisors would be more meaningful for older workers who have a wealth of experience to draw from and impart to younger workers. Employers need to explore ways to redesign jobs for older workers so that they can continue to contribute and draw from their experience, skills and knowledge meaningfully.Let me move on to the next segment of my speech on support for persons with disabilities or special needs. Persons with disabilities or special needs have always found it more challenging than most of us to be gainfully employed, stay employed and have opportunities for career progression.For some of them, finding employment is a seemingly insurmountable hurdle. Not many employers are willing to employ persons with disabilities or special needs even though there are Government-funded employment grants to facilitate this, such as the Special Employment Credit, Workfare Training Scheme and the Open Door Programme. Employer contribution and support is still substantially required and not many employers are willing to go that extra mile to invest in persons with disabilities or special needs.Other than employer support, persons with disabilities or special needs seem to earn relatively lower salaries than typical hires. While there is insuﬃcient data to confirm this, the anecdotal evidence is already quite disturbing.Do we expect persons with disabilities or special needs to be able to fend for themselves with much less disposable income? Do we expect them to be dependent on others for the rest of their lives? Can we not accord them greater recognition, as well as remuneration, for their abilities and talents out of the goodness of our hearts as fellow human beings and not just depend on numbers reflecting positive returns on investments?While there have been improvements made to making our society and workplaces more inclusive towards persons with disabilities or special needs, there is still a long way to go in ensuring they can be financially independent, recognised for their abilities and talents and not be judged for being atypical and that they can very much be a part of our community, society, schools and workplaces as every one else.I will speak more on providing the necessary employment support for persons with disabilities or special needs in the MOMCOS.Let me now move to the last segment of my speech on flexi-work provisions and support.The current COVID-19 public health situation has been a very challenging one. Our daily work routines are drastically changed and remote interactions and communication have replaced physical interactions or face-to-face communication. However, with every challenge comes an opportunity for us to learn and initiate and embrace change.Flexi-work provisions, arrangement and support have been extensively rolled out during this period. We find that even with some initial inconveniences, we are able to work remotely, flexibly and still fulfil our daily work or meet our daily business targets, with some creative provisions and solutions, to ensure business and work continuity. Flexi-work is not too diﬃcult to implement after all. Necessity is truly the mother of all inventions.I hope that once we are able to ride out the current COVID-19 public health situation, we will remember the lessons we have learnt during this period and we will continue to implement flexi-work with the support of employers and companies. Just as we trust our workers and staﬀ to work remotely or on a flexible work arrangement during this period, we must continue to trust them to give the same amount of commitment and eﬀort when the worst is over.In addition, as I have mentioned in my Budget speech last year, flexi-work arrangements can provide for better employment opportunities for persons with disabilities or special needs to work from home or to gradually adjust to their work environments and work commitments at a pace they are comfortable with. Being gainfully employed and being able to be remunerated for doing meaningful work is a start in helping persons with disabilities or special needs live independently like many others and it accords suﬃcient opportunities to develop that much-needed self belief and self dignity. Hence, I urge employers and companies to carry on with their flexi-work arrangements that we already have in place now during the current COVID-19 public health situation so that our society, communities and workplaces can be a lot more inclusive, especially for those who are less privileged or who face more challenges in life.To conclude, Mr Deputy Speaker, I reiterate my support for the various provisions, as well as the employment and employability assistance measures provided for in this year's Budget. While there are still areas in which the necessary provisions and assistance can be even further enhanced, the Government is cognisant of the various needs of the diﬀerent segments of our society and has done much to ensure there is some help for everyone.Beyond the dollars and cents, the Government will be spending on helping the diﬀerent segments of our society, including for employers, we have to continue to work together to make our society, communities and workplaces better, stronger and more inclusive. Let us continue to build our \"democracy of deeds\". This is what SG Together is all about.If I may end with a quote by Winston Churchill: \"We make a living by what we get; We make a life by what we give.\" Notwithstanding the suggestions I have for future provisions and assistance by the Government, I support this year's Budget."

        "Content": "Order for Second Reading read.4.51 pmThe Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo): Mr Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"The CPF system has evolved to meet the changing needs of each generation of Singaporeans. It started as a retirement savings scheme in July 1955, when many workers in small- and medium-sized companies did not receive retirement benefits from their employers. CPF helped them to have something for retirement. In 1968, in order to improve housing affordability, CPF usage was expanded to help members buy HDB flats. From 1981, CPF savings could also be used to buy private properties. This made home ownership a reality for over 90% of Singaporean households and helped them to share in Singapore’s growth. It also gave them an asset to rely on in retirement. In 1984, in order to meet rising healthcare needs, we created the MediSave Account. This helped Singaporeans cope with big healthcare expenses, such as hospitalisation. As life expectancy continued to rise, so did the risk of Singaporeans outliving their savings. In 2009, we started to transition from the Minimum Sum Scheme, now known as the Retirement Sum Scheme, to the CPF LIFE annuity scheme. Members on CPF LIFE have the assurance of a constant stream of retirement income for as long as they live.[Deputy Speaker (Mr Lim Biow Chuan) in the Chair]The CPF system is a continuous work-in-progress. Its three-in-one feature is also unique. No other retirement system tries to help people fulfil three basic needs in retirement – housing, healthcare and day-to-day spending. Comparisons with other systems often neglect this important fact. There is also considerable complexity mainly because new rules have to co-exist with previous rules for earlier cohorts.Be that as it may, CPF should continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of our people. This Bill is part of that evolution. It will amend the CPF Act in two broad areas: first, to cater to changes in employment practices; second, to clarify and streamline the administration of the CPF Act.With the Deputy Speaker’s permission, I will also use this opportunity to respond to Mr Chong Kee Hiong’s supplementary question earlier this afternoon and provide an update on the changes we are making to the Retirement Sum Scheme in response to feedback from members of the public.In 2017, Ministry of Manpower had set up a Tripartite Workgroup on self-employed persons (SEPs) to look into the concerns of SEPs and make recommendations on how to address them. In both the Committee of Supply debates of 2018 and 2019, I gave updates on the Workgroup's recommendations and their implementation. One recommendation was to help SEPs save for their retirement and healthcare needs through the CPF system.Today, SEPs must make contributions to the MediSave Account. Unlike regular employees, there is no requirement for them to contribute to the Ordinary and Special Accounts. Members know how MediSave Account balances can be very helpful. They can be used to pay for medical treatment and MediShield Life premiums, which helps with hospital bills. The converse is true: a depleted MediSave Account exposes the SEP to risks of not having the support for healthcare expenses when he or his family needs it most. Currently, SEPs make their MediSave contributions every year based on their earnings in the previous year.This approach of making yearly contributions for past years' earnings can be improved. Unlike regular employees, SEPs do not have a simple process to make small regular contributions as and when they earn income. When the time comes to make the out-of-pocket lump-sum contribution the following year, SEPs with cash flow constraints face difficulties. This happens more often than not. In any given year, about 60% of SEPs do not make their MediSave contributions in full in a lump sum. This is very significant – about 130,000 of them.As a result, some choose to pay via a 12-month instalment plan. Nonetheless, a significant number do not sign up for an instalment plan or have stopped paying their instalments. The root cause of this may be that these SEPs have irregular income. Should they wish to get back into regular employment with more steady income, we have many schemes to help them do so. In fact, last year, more SEPs switched to regular employment.But for those who remain in self-employment, we should also find a way to help them avoid slipping further back. This is what the pilot is about – helping SEPs keep up with their MediSave contributions, to strengthen their protection against health shocks.The first set of amendments will allow for a pilot \"Contribute-as-you-Earn\" scheme, CAYE for short. This will be for a small group of about 6,000 SEPs who provide services directly to the Government and public sector agencies. As a service buyer, the Government can help SEPs directly transmit their contributions to their MediSave Account, and then pay the rest of the service fee to them. The Government plans to start this pilot from 1 January 2020.With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, may I ask the Clerks to distribute the CAYE infographic?Mr Deputy Speaker: Yes, please. [A handout was distributed to hon Members.]Mrs Josephine Teo: Let me illustrate how CAYE works. Take for example, Sam, who is a 48-year-old self-employed soccer coach. A Primary school engaged Sam to conduct a two-hour soccer clinic. The Primary school paid Sam $120 for the session, of which $20 was the expense that Sam incurred. Effectively, his income from this session was $100. Under the current contribution model, the school would have paid Sam the full service fee amount of $120.With CAYE, the school will help Sam make a contribution of $10 for the two-hour soccer clinic. Why $10? Well, this is because Sam has estimated that his income from this job is around $100 after taking out the expenses. Based on his income in the previous year, the MediSave contribution payable is 10% of the income he earns and not the total service fee, which can include expenses. At the same time that it contributes the $10 to Sam’s MediSave Account, the school pays out to Sam the balance $110 for this particular assignment.We can expect Sam to take on various jobs throughout the year, not all of them with MOE schools.\tSupposing his net trade income in total is $30,000. He would have to make a MediSave contribution of $3,000. Suppose also that $13,000 of his income came from work done for MOE. By the time the CPF statement arrives, the schools would have helped him contribute $1,300, or 10% of $13,000, throughout the year. And so, as a result, the remaining contribution is no longer $3,000 but a reduced amount of $1,700.How does Sam benefit from this? I think we can see that his risk of not being able to make the contribution in full is now lower – it is $1,700 instead of $3,000.Like regular employees, Sam can make smaller and more regular contributions to his MediSave as and when he receives a payment. This is helpful as his income may be seasonal due to, for example, less work during examination periods. CAYE will also help Sam grow his MediSave monies. By contributing earlier, he will accrue more interest on his MediSave contributions.Some SEPs are more comfortable with the current model of MediSave contributions and may prefer not to be on CAYE yet. SEPs who have made their MediSave contributions in full or are keeping up via an instalment plan will be allowed to opt out of this pilot. Such SEPs can set their CAYE contribution rate to zero.For SEPs who have not been keeping up with their MediSave contributions, we will continue to give them time to clear their back payments. But it is better that they make contributions through CAYE. This will help them keep up with the current MediSave obligations and prevent their obligations from snowballing.Let me just make clear a number of things since it concerns CPF.There is absolutely no change to the obligations of the self-employed for CPF contributions. Even after Parliament passes the amendment, the obligations are the same as before.The only change concerns how those contributions are made. Instead of a lump-sum payment once a year, small contributions will be made from SEPs' income each time the income is earned. As this pilot only involves SEPs who provide services to the Government, only a fraction will be affected. If these SEPs have in fact been up-to-date with their payments, they can also opt out of the pilot.As part of our consultations for the Bill, we had in-depth discussions with the NTUC and leaders of the SEP associations. They have generally welcomed the introduction of CAYE and recognise its benefits. However, they are also concerned with some of the SEPs who are already falling behind in payments. Specifically, Mr Ang Hin Kee and leaders from the National Instructors and Coaches Association (NICA), the Professional Photographers Association (Singapore) (PPAS) and the Singapore Association of Motion Picture Professionals (SAMPP) suggested that the Government provide some matching of the SEPs' MediSave contributions when they participate in CAYE. I have discussed with my colleagues and we agree this is a good suggestion. The Government will look into providing some support for SEPs participating in the CAYE pilot.Some Members may ask if we can extend CAYE so that like regular employees, all of Sam's contributions would have been made as and when he earned an income. Let me emphasise CAYE is a pilot. We have not taken a decision on whether CAYE will be extended to include payments made to the SEPs by private sector companies or intermediaries, such as for insurance and real estate agents. Some of the intermediaries have already indicated interest. They can see the benefit of helping their agents make MediSave payments as and when they earn an income. This is especially if the lump-sum payment happens to be required during a lull period the next year when the agent earns less income. However, let us try out CAYE first, see how well it works and decide later if and how other SEPs can also benefit.Mr Deputy Speaker, let me now turn to employment practices which are also changing and, therefore, require that we keep pace by updating the CPF Act. We therefore plan to amend the CPF Act to be more responsive to the evolving needs of employers and employees. Let me explain.Today, employers may structure wage components that are tied to certain contractual obligations. For example, a sign-on bonus with a minimum service period condition. If the employee chooses to leave before the minimum completion date is up, he is required to return the sign-on bonus to his former employer. This practice is allowed under the Employment Act. To restore both parties to their original positions, the employee also needs to return the CPF which his former employer paid on the sign-on bonus. However, the CPF Act does not allow the CPF Board to grant refunds for this repayable component.Regulations prescribed under the amended CPF Act will give employees flexibility to apply for a refund for the CPF portion within one year of having to return the conditional wage. Employers may also apply for the refund, with the employee's consent.Let me illustrate with an example. Suppose Daniel receives a sign-on on bonus in January on the condition that he works for one full year. He gets $4,000 in cash and $1,850 in his CPF, which is the contribution on the sign-on bonus. If he so happens to leave his job in March, he has to return a total of $5,850 to his employer. Of which, $1,850 is actually in his CPF account.Under today's rules, Daniel will be out-of-pocket for the $1,850 as CPF Board is unable to refund this amount from Daniel’s CPF to pay back his employer. With this amendment, Daniel may apply to CPF Board to refund the $1,850 from his CPF account to his employer if he wishes. With Daniel’s consent, his employer may also apply directly to CPF Board for the refund.Let me state for the record that we neither encourage nor discourage the practice of sign-on bonuses. With the changes, regulations can be made to allow members and employers greater flexibility to accept and offer such payments, knowing they can obtain a refund of their CPF contributions if the payment has to be returned.The second and final set of amendments provide greater clarity and efficiency in the administration of the CPF Act. I will provide one example.The Home Protection Scheme (HPS) is a mortgage insurance scheme. It protects CPF members and their families from the risk of losing their home if the breadwinner meets with an unforeseen event, like death. When this happens, it understandably takes some time until the claim is paid. The grieving family will need time to report the claim. CPF Board will need time to process and make the claim payment to the mortgage bank or to HDB in the case of HDB loans. Meanwhile, the interest on the mortgage loan continues to accrue.In practice, CPF Board has always paid the interest accrued on the outstanding loan all the way until the claim is paid. In other words, families have not needed to make further payments because of the time it took to report and process the claim. This amendment simply regularises this practice in the legislation.This sums up the key amendments to the CPF Act. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.Mr Deputy Speaker, may I also seek your permission to respond to the supplementary question raised by Mr Chong Kee Hiong?Mr Deputy Speaker: Yes, Minister.5: 09 pmMrs Josephine Teo: I will take this opportunity to briefly talk about changes we are making to the Retirement Sum Scheme (RSS) in response to feedback from Members. I shared in a written Parliamentary reply in October that MOM and CPF Board were reviewing the RSS payout rules. We have completed the review.With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, may I ask the Clerks to distribute a factsheet on the changes to Retirement Sum Scheme payouts?Mr Deputy Speaker: Yes, please. [A handout was distributed to hon Members]Mrs Josephine Teo: Although we have introduced CPF LIFE, the RSS is still the main CPF retirement income scheme today. Most members aged 65 and above today receive their retirement payouts through the RSS. More members will start receiving their retirement payouts through CPF LIFE from 2023 onwards, when the first cohort of mandatory CPF LIFE members reaches their payout eligibility age. Members will be automatically included in CPF LIFE if they have at least $60,000 in their Retirement Account at age 65. CPF LIFE will provide them with payouts for as long as they live.On the other hand, RSS payouts are designed to last up to 20 years from the payout eligibility age. This takes into account the base interest rate earned on Retirement Account savings, which is now 4%. We call this the “base payout”. In 2008, the Government introduced Extra Interest and again in 2016, the Additional Extra Interest. This benefited all members and especially those with lower balances. It was deliberately designed as a progressive move. All this extra interest earned from age 55 is used to stretch the payouts beyond the usual 20 years, up to age 95 at most, to protect members from outliving their RSS payouts. So, the base payouts would have lasted up to 20 years, but with the extra interest, they last longer, can be up to 95 for some members.We have received feedback from some members who felt that the RSS payout duration of up to age 95 was too long. Designing payouts to last up to age 95 will cover the longevity risk of up to four in five members. In other words, only one in five members is expected to outlive his RSS payout. While this approach is fundamentally sound, it does mean that for the members who had remaining balances in their Retirement Accounts when they passed on, their RSS payouts could have been slightly higher.We will change the RSS payout computation to address members’ feedback on long payout duration. The key change we will make is to design RSS payouts such that they will last to age 90 at most, instead of age 95. The base payout will continue to last up to 20 years.Today, all of the Extra Interest and Additional Extra Interest that a member earns from age 55 goes towards extending his RSS payouts beyond 20 years. We will adjust this. Extra interest earned from age 55 until the member starts his payouts will now be used to increase his payout amount. Extra interest earned after the member starts his payouts will continue to extend his payout duration. Moreover, the extension will go to age 90 at most, instead of age 95. Particularly for RSS members whose payouts were originally projected to end past age 90, these changes will increase their payout amounts.Let me illustrate with an example. Let us say Mr Tan is aged 65 today and starting his RSS payouts. Based on his Retirement Account savings and the current RSS payout rules, he will receive a payout of about $470 for 30 years. His payout duration comprises 20 years of base payouts and an extension of 10 years from the extra interest earned on his savings. In other words, his payouts will end when he is aged 95. Under the new RSS payout rules, his payouts will increase from $470 to $520. However, the payouts will end at age 90.The new RSS payout rules will continue providing longevity risk protection for up to two in three members. In other words, the majority of members on the RSS will still receive payouts for as long as they are expected to live. For those who prefer a longer payout duration, they have the option of joining CPF LIFE before age 80. This will guarantee that they receive payouts for as long as they live.Allow me to also add, for avoidance of doubt, that there is no change to the payout eligibility ages or withdrawal rules for RSS members. If you are 65 today, you can start to get your payouts. That remains the same.I would also like to be very clear that members who are currently receiving payouts will either get the same or higher payouts as a result of these changes to payout rules. No one will see a reduction in the payouts that they are currently receiving.Separately, we will adjust the RSS payout computation so that when members defer their payouts, or make a top-up, they will generally see an increase in their payout amount.The changes to how RSS payouts are computed will take effect in 2020. All RSS members who turn 65 from 1 July 2020 will be on the new payout rules.Let me repeat that there is no change to when they can start their payouts, only how those payouts are computed. As per usual practice, members will receive a letter six months before their 65th birthday. This letter will inform them that they can choose to start their payouts from 65 if they wish.As for older RSS members who have already chosen to start their payouts under the current rules, we will apply the new payout rules to them from 1 January 2020 if the resulting payout amount is higher than their current payout. Around 60,000 members will see their payouts increase as a result.To communicate the change clearly to RSS members who have started their payouts, CPF Board will send a one-time letter. Relevant RSS members who are receiving their payouts will receive this letter, which will inform them whether and how they are affected.To conclude, the changes will see RSS payout duration last to age 90 at most. All RSS members who are currently receiving payouts will get either higher payouts or the same payouts.Mr Speaker, the CPF Amendment Bill provides workers and employers with more flexibility, in particular, flexibility to adapt to future employment practices. It also clarifies the administration of the CPF Act.Together with the changes to the RSS payout rules, we are making CPF processes more member-centric. This is not a one-off task. As Members will appreciate, we will have to continue updating the CPF system to better serve the changing needs of its members.Mr Deputy Speaker: Supplementary questions regarding the Minister's answer to RSS will be taken at the end of the Bill.Question proposed.5.18 pmMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.I note that there are several amendments to the CPF Act. However, my focus today would be the introduction or provision of the Contribute-As-You-Earn (CAYE) scheme.The CAYE scheme is designed to help self-employed persons contribute to their MediSave account as and when they are paid for their work, instead of requiring a yearly lump sum. Starting from 2020 onwards, under the CAYE scheme, self-employed persons will have small and regular contributions made to their MediSave accounts when the Government pays for their services. The Government will transmit the MediSave contributions of the self-employed person to his/her MediSave account. He/she will then receive the balance fee.In this regard, it is similar to the existing CPF contribution scheme which requires employers to make monthly contributions to their employees' CPF accounts. I also note that the CAYE scheme is presently at its infancy and, at this point, the pilot run is not applicable to the private sector. I am glad to note that the Minister has agreed to consider some form of matching contribution for this pilot CAYE.While the CAYE scheme is no doubt commendable and a positive attempt by the Government to support freelance and self-employed workers, I have the following questions for the Minister.First, we note that, at present, the CAYE pilot scheme will only be applicable for Government contracts and there are no plans to extend it to the private sector as of now, during this pilot phase, presumably to ensure that there are no glitches and that MediSave contributions are calculated correctly. My question is: are there plans to extend it to the private sector? If there are plans, when can we expect that it would be extended to the private sector? And does MOM foresee any resistance from the private sector?Second, I note that, at present, there are approximately 6,000 self-employed persons who provide services directly to the Government and, therefore, stand to benefit from the CAYE scheme. As of last year, I understand that there were approximately 200,000 self-employed persons in Singapore's resident workforce. If the figure of 200,000 remains the same this year, it would mean that only 6,000 out of the 200,000 self-employed persons – about 3% – provide services directly to the Government.Would the Minister be able to provide some clarification as to why only 3% of the self-employed persons provide services directly to the Government? Is it because the Government generally prefers contracting with bigger and more stable companies with established reputations? In this case, what more can be done to help self-employed persons remain competitive? Or would it be due to the differences in demand and supply of the nature of the services provided by the self-employed persons? Does MOM see the figure of 3% as worrying? In which case, what more can be done? We need to ensure that these freelancers do not lose their rice bowls, amidst the economic uncertainty. What other ways are there which the Government is utilising or considering to support the healthcare and retirement needs of freelancers in Singapore?Third, we observe that there is increasing fluidity in Singapore's employment landscape. For instance, some freelancers have opted to diversify their careers by picking up regular employment and working as employees by day and freelancing at night, subject to the terms of their employment contracts.In such a situation, those involved in regular employment by day, would already have the requisite CPF contributions through the employer's plus employee’s CPF contributions needed for the big-ticket items in life, such as housing, retirement as well as healthcare bills and so on.In this case, would the CAYE scheme still serve its objective of ensuring that these self-employed persons are self-sufficient? Are there considerations for this class of persons to be exempted from MediSave contributions in respect of their freelance work and revenue, to avoid imposing additional financial constraints upon them, especially since the Singapore economy is going through an uncertain period?Lastly, as a general observation, the CAYE scheme was developed to plug the lacuna in the law and assist self-employed persons with saving monies in their CPF account to tide them through rainy days and fund big ticket items. The root cause of this issue is fundamentally because self-employed persons, or freelancers, are not employees and, therefore, not entitled to CPF contributions to begin with.However, it is worth highlighting that in some countries, such as Norway and Australia, certain classes of self-employed persons, such as food delivery riders, are now considered \"employees\" and accorded employees' rights and benefits, including the right to join unions. Perhaps, in due course, it may be time to examine our laws to determine if certain classes of freelancers should be accorded \"employee\" status and the associated benefits, especially where their contract for service resembles an employment contract. Perhaps, a good starting point would be to allow freelancers to be covered within the scope of the Trade Unions Act. Sir, my clarifications notwithstanding, I stand in support of this Bill.5.24 pmMr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I recently took an MRT ride with a freelance trainer and, a few weeks later, I had lunch with another freelance coach. Both of them shared a similar story with me, about the need to use hand sanitizers regularly. So, I was curious as to why they said that. And it is so coincidental that both asked me the same thing.I guess the reason they gave me was that, as a freelancer, you have to look after your health and make sure you do not fall sick. Other than the fact that you may have to pay medical bills, recuperate at home, but you also may miss out on fulfilling your clients' obligations that you promise to deliver. That is about taking personal ownership – looking after one's health, buying appropriate insurance, topping up your MediSave account and exercising regularly.In fact, over the last few years, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have met with many freelancers – sports coaches, tutors, actors, movie-makers, band instructors, those who do rigging in stages and outdoor events, emcees, photographers, beauticians, choir instructors, orchestra directors, fitness instructors, translators, taxi and private hire drivers, getai performers. This is just to illustrate the wide spectrum of industries and vocations that many of our freelancers today come from. It is no longer the traditional tutors and taxi drivers alone. Many of them shared with me that they do adopt a healthy lifestyle and exercise regularly, contribute to their MediSave account. Some even bought prolonged medical leave insurance to cover potential loss of income should they fall sick or recover from some major surgery.As the Minister rightly pointed out earlier, 60% of them do not do so. And this is especially so among younger job entrants who just became freelancers. I spoke to many of them and they shared that they think that this is only a transition job; it is not something that they will hold on to for a long time.Making MediSave contributions are not at the top of their mind among these young freelances. In fact, in my engagement with the CPF Board, I also learnt that many experienced freelancers are also not prompt in making MediSave contributions even though there are instalment plans made available with the CPF Board. And the Minister had earlier also alluded to the same facts. The reasons may be varied, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the outcome is the same. Freelancers run the risks of inadequate medical provisions.So, what are we to do about this? How do we help to place them under the safety net that every other employed worker is provided for? Some argue that freelancers, \"You are independent. Look after yourself. Make the necessary provisions.\" Others ask for more Government interventions.With this amendment, I think the role that the Government is taking on is clear.First, as a responsible service buyer, the Government wants to help freelancers make contributions to their MediSave accounts so that they can have adequate savings for medical needs through the CAYE scheme.Secondly, it is also imperative that the Government ropes in all Singaporean workers to come under its CPF safety net in an efficient and effective manner. I am, therefore, supportive of this amendment. I have three requests for the Government's consideration, of which, the Minister has already answered one.First, I hope that the Government can be more proactive in supporting freelancers beyond the CAYE. The emerging gig economy is something that we are all aware of and it has created a new form of employment among many workers. One key concern is that there may be risks that may be passed on from companies to these gig workers who actually are unable to take on much risks, such as instability in their wages and not being prepared for retirement. My hon colleague Mr Patrick Tay also alluded to the fact that food delivery drivers may fall into this category of workers who may be unaware of the risks.For instance, I have also mentioned in my previous speeches that we, too, see many freelancers doing food delivery. Although they wear the attire of the platform provider and comply with rules quite similar to that of an employee, they are being classified as freelancers. I know that the Ministry has a WorkRight programme to ensure that those mis-classified workers will be put right and be clocked back as far as CPF and other statutory rights are being provided for.However, do we need to, therefore, relook whether there is a need to re-categorise the different types of freelancers, identify those who are more vulnerable and ascertain to see if they need to be provided and protected by the law? Whilst we want to retain the flexibility of a gig economy, we should also review the way we define who is an employee in view of today's new employment arrangements.Secondly, many freelancers are already making their MediSave contributions to an instalment plan. And I am glad that the Minister has earlier mentioned and announced that the Government is seriously considering a support system to the MediSave contribution of freelancers who transact with Government entities. This is a welcomed announcement.There is, Mr Deputy Speaker, already a precedent among taxi operators who co-contribute to taxi drivers' monthly MediSave contributions, that is, the Drive and Save (DAS) scheme. So, this announcement by MOM will definitely help freelancers transit to this new arrangement and I look forward to the details of the support.Thirdly and finally, I would like to urge that the Ministry look at enhancing training support for freelancers. This should address the training needs of not just freelancers who transact with Government buyers, but more importantly, the employability of all freelancers. I mentioned earlier, some young freelancers shared that they started off freelancing, thinking it is a transition job but there are other older freelancers who also thought that it was a transitional job, but over time, it became their only full-time choice. This is because even if some struggle to improve their wage prospects or income doing freelance work, they do not possess the adequate skills to move to other jobs.In the Ministry's regular survey, I hope statistics can be collected pertaining to the training status and employability of our freelancers. This is to ensure we roll out timely interventions before the employability gap grows larger. Meanwhile, can we consider supporting them in their training endeavors with funding help in the form of training allowance or absentee payroll that we offer other workers?Mr Deputy Speaker, we need new solutions and I am very glad that the Ministry has already roll out a programme like the CAYE. Such new solutions are needed even as we address the unintended consequences of this new form of employment. This will ensure that freelancers do not unnecessarily struggle with employment or employability options. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion.5.32 pmAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this CPF (Amendment) Bill seeks to pilot the Contribute-As-You-Earn Scheme for self-employed workers. The scheme will see service buyers deduct a portion of their payment to self-employed workers to contribute to the workers' MediSave accounts. This scheme actually does not make any material change to the workers' position since they already have to make a contribution to their MediSave account based on their previous year tax returns. What it does is to smooth out the contributions so that workers will not face a situation where they have to fork out a lump sum annually and may not have enough cash on hand to do so. This scheme is also limited in that it is to be piloted by the Government and affecting only self-employed workers on contracts for service with the Government.A critic could give a cynical shrug to this limited move by the Government and argue that this does not change the status quo, except to secure contributions to MediSave. I am not going to see it this way. Rather, I choose to see the Contribute-As-You-Earn Scheme as a wedge that could open the door for the Government to regulate the self-employed work sector and do more for self-employed workers. In the spirit of the Contribute-As-You-Earn Scheme to address the income protection, retirement adequacy and contracting issues faced by self-employed workers, I will speak on these three areas accordingly, in terms of the next steps the Government can take to do more for self-employed workers.Income protection. The first area where the Government can do more for self-employed workers is to address income protection linked to work-related injuries and medical exigencies. Firstly, self-employed workers are not covered by the Work Injury Compensation Act. This is despite the fact that self-employed workers are exposed to the same work-related injury risks as their counterparts who are considered \"employees\". With regards to work-related injuries, this difference between a self-employed worker and an employee is more a legal artefact rather than a distinction grounded in reality.The Minister had said in July in reply to a question on work injury insurance for food delivery riders by the hon Member Mr Desmond Choo that the distinction between employee and self-employed workers is that a company has control over the work arrangements of employees but has no full control over the work arrangements of self-employed workers.Surely, this is overstating the case in reality. On the one hand, companies often have considerable control over the work arrangements of self-employed workers, especially for companies operating in the gig economy using membership tiering, incentives and penalties to regulate workers' discretion. On the other hand, companies do not often have full control over the work arrangements of employees, especially for companies operating in the gig economy as the same digital platforms will be used for different categories of workers.I believe the Ministry is aware that the distinction is not black and white. Thus, Minister Teo said that the Workplace Safety and Health Council has been encouraging food delivery companies to buy personal accident insurance for all their riders and that major operators Deliveroo and GrabFood already do so. Given this blurred distinction between self-employed workers and employees in the new economy, would it not make more sense for the law, for WICA, to change to include self-employed workers?Secondly, self-employed workers may not have enough income protection if they face medical exigencies. Based on the Tripartite Workgroup's recommendations, the Ministry worked with insurers NTUC Income and Gigacover to offer Prolonged Medical Leave insurance to self-employed workers. The insurance provides income of $60 to $80 a day for hospitalisation and prolonged medical leave. This is good progress.However, almost two years have lapsed since this initiative was started and the low participation of self-employed workers may be a concern. The Ministry promoted the insurance to two occupational groups that together comprised 30 per cent of all self-employed workers, namely sports coaches and instructors and taxi and private-hire drivers. I would like to ask what percentage of self-employed workers in these two occupational groups are now covered by Prolonged Medical Leave insurance?Also, Minister Teo mentioned in theCOSdebate in March this year that Grab and Gojek were providing free Prolonged Medical Leave insurance to regular drivers and that ComfortDelgro was considering. Is ComfortDelgro now providing the insurance to its taxi drivers?Would the Minister consider legislating to make it compulsory for service buyers in certain sectors to purchase Prolonged Medical Leave insurance for their regular self-employed workers? Many self-employed workers are regular contractors with the same service buyers for many years and even decades. The self-employed workers in the two occupational groups fit this description. This is due to the oligopolistic or monopolistic character of the sectors they work in. The distinction between self-employed workers and employees are blurred in such sectors. Grab and Gojek recognise this and provide free Prolonged Medical Leave insurance to their regular drivers. It would make sense thus to legislate for income protection insurance for such sectors.Retirement adequacy. The second area where the Government can do more for self-employed workers is to address retirement adequacy leveraging the Contribute-As-You-Earn scheme and also the SkillsFuture movement.Firstly, it is known that self-employed workers are deprived of CPF savings since they miss out on the 20% of wages employees are compelled to save and the 17% additional contribution by employers. The Government has urged self-employed workers to make voluntary contributions to their CPF if they can afford to do so. But the problem is that self-employed workers are already lagging in their savings compared to employees. A Manulife survey in 2018 found that in reference to a $1 million retirement savings target, the average savings gap of self-employed workers was 55% larger than regular employees.One way to address this issue is to leverage the Contribute-As-You-Earn scheme to encourage self-employed workers to make regular voluntary contributions to their CPF with the right incentive. For example, self-employed workers could opt in to contribute 10% of their income up to the monthly contribution ceiling of $6,000 through the Contribute-As-You-Earn scheme. The Government could incentivise this by offering a flat and thus progressive CPF top-up of, say, $300 a year to self-employed workers who join this programme for the whole year. Progressive service buyers could be encouraged to match the Government's CPF top-up.Secondly, with the national skills development framework well in place and catered to employees, self-employed workers who are deprived of SkillsFuture support could become disadvantaged. As many self-employed workers treat their gig work as temporary jobs to transit to full-time employment, they could become disenfranchised if they are unable to tap into SkillsFuture support and resources to upskill to make the transition.Ultimately, given the structure of our labour market and our national pension system, it makes sense to safeguard the retirement adequacy of our self-employed workers by helping them upskill and transit to full-time work as employees benefiting from full CPF contributions. Self-employed workers make up 8% to 10% of our workforce. This is a significant group. The SkillsFuture movement cannot afford to ignore self-employed workers. There need to be schemes targeted at self-employed workers to upgrade and develop their skills.Contracting issues. The third area where the Government can do more for self-employed workers is to address contracting issues in terms of standards and the test for dependency.Firstly, most self-employed workers are still not covered by basic standards of contracting. In a recent reply to a question by the hon Member Assoc Prof Walter Theseira, Minister Josephine Teo said that, as of July 2019, 47,000 workers were covered by the Tripartite Standard for Contracting with Self-Employed Persons, as adopted by 600 employers. This barely covers a quarter of the 200,000 self-employed workers reliant on proper contracting to earn their living.It is stated that the Tripartite Standard \"specifies a set of fair and progressive employment practices for service contracts that all service buyers should implement at the workplace\". The practices comprise terms of products or services to be delivered and written key terms that include names of contracting parties, parties' obligation such as nature of services to be provided and payment due for each product or service and due date of payment. These are very basic practices underpinning a contract for service. As fundamental practices, should not the Tripartite Standard be made mandatory for all companies seeking to contract with self-employed workers?Secondly, in the last three years, of the total of 308 cases of suspected misclassification received by the Ministry, 160 cases involved workers assessed to be misclassified as self-employed workers, with an average of about 100 workers a year found to be misclassified. Affected employees were paid overtime pay and CPF contributions due to them. What were the criteria used to assess misclassification? Should these criteria be used to test whole occupational groups to see whether there is systematic misclassification due to new digital technologies allowing for platform engagement work?In Australia, there has been discussion about the test of dependency with regards to platform engagement work. The argument is that many independent contractors signing on to work on digital platforms end up being dependent on the control and direction of the company they are working for, which looks like regular employment. Unions have pointed out that companies in the gig economy exhibit multiple features of employment such as regulating the behaviour of workers, providing equipment to perform work, interviewing and screening workers, providing training, arranging shift rosters and so on.Is the test of dependency a valid test in Singapore for distinguishing between self-employed workers and regular employees? If so, should not the Government conduct a systematic review of all classification of self-employed workers, especially in key sectors of the gig economy?Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Contribute-As-You-Earn scheme is a wedge that keeps the door open for us to discuss, debate and act on improving the lot of self-employed workers as they navigate the new economy. I have argued that WICA should cover self-employed workers, that we should legislate for income protection in oligopolistic sectors, that we should encourage regular voluntary CPF contributions using incentives, that there should be SkillsFuture schemes targeted at upskilling self-employed workers, that the Tripartite Standard for Contracting with Self-Employed Persons be made mandatory, that the test of dependency might be applied to the current classification of self-employed workers contracted to platform companies. I support the Bill.5.42 pmAssoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill is the result of a 50-year journey towards greater social protection for the self-employed through the Central Provident Fund scheme. Today, self-employed persons (SEPs) are only required to contribute to MediSave. Contributions to other CPF accounts are voluntary. When this Act is passed, we will be able to help SEPs contribute to CPF through the Contribute-As-You-Earn or CAYE mechanism.I will cover two broad issues in my speech: First, the legislative history of how SEPs are treated in the CPF Act and second, the economic reasons why this amendment is necessary, timely and should spur us to providing even greater coverage of SEPs through CPF, beyond Medisave contributions, in the future.I will start by highlighting a key change in the primary legislation. The present section 77(1)(e) provides the Minister with the discretion to require SEPs to contribute to CPF. This is the legislative basis for regulations requiring SEPs to contribute to MediSave. This will be replaced by the new section 9A, which states that SEPs must contribute to CPF. To support CAYE, the new section 9B requires collectors who engage and pay SEPs to make contributions to CPF on their behalf. Clauses in section 9C amongst others provide the Minister with discretion in how this will be implemented.At first, this would appear to be a substantive policy change. It is a shift in the primary legislation from stating that SEPs may be required to contribute to CPF, to stating that SEPs must contribute to CPF. But in fact, a reading of the legislative history of section 77(1)(e) shows that Parliament has always intended for the self-employed to be covered by CPF. Fifty-one years ago, in 1968, then Minister for Labour Mr S Rajaratnam first proposed the idea of covering SEPs through CPF. The present section 77(1)(e) originates in the CPF (Amendment) Bill No 26/1968.In the second reading debate on 1 August 1968, Mr Rajaratnam stated, and I quote, \"The principal purposes of the Bill are… (iii) to enable the provisions of the Central Provident Fund Ordinance to be extended to cover persons who are self-employed and who do not at present contribute to the fund.\" He went on to say that the necessary regulations to effect this would be made in due course. It appears clear Parliament intended in 1968 that CPF should compulsorily cover SEPs.Unfortunately, between 1968 and 1992 we appear to have lost the momentum to cover SEPs through CPF. As far as I can tell, no policy required SEPs to contribute to CPF during those years, although the text of section 77(1)(e) was amended in 1973 to the present format.It was only in 1992 that SEPs were first required to contribute to CPF, for MediSave only. The CPF Act was then amended to provide for administering SEP MediSave contributions, including penalties for non-compliance. In the Second Reading debate on 31 July 1992, Mr Chiam See Tong asked why SEPs were asked to contribute to MediSave only, when the original purpose of CPF was to provide for old age protection in general.Then Minister for Labour, Dr Lee Boon Yang replied, and I quote, \"We are only extending this contribution to the CPF by the self-employed for Medisave at this present moment. In fact, we would like to encourage all self-employed persons to contribute to the other accounts in the CPF, that is, the Ordinary Account and the Special Account. I am very pleased that Mr Chiam supports this move. In due course, perhaps we can take up his suggestion and move in the direction to extend the entire CPF scheme to all self-employed persons.\"I note that the CPF Act did not need to be amended in 1992 in order to require SEPs to contribute to MediSave. The subsidiary legislation was enacted on 1 July 1992 under section 77(1)(e) and predates the second reading of the CPF Act that year. So, the powers under section 77(1)(e) have always been sufficient to require SEPs to contribute to CPF.So, what are the lessons for us? First, I think the difference in the framing of the primary legislation does matter. Section 77(1)(e) only says that SEPs may be required to contribute. There is discretion provided to the Minister. The new section 9A in this Bill says that SEPs must contribute. In retrospect, the original discretionary framing of section 77(1)(e) may explain why we took 24 years, from 1968 to 1992, to require SEPs to contribute to MediSave. Section 77(1)(e) does not impose any requirement to act, even though the Parliamentary intent to cover SEPs with CPF was clear in 1968.Second, I think we should be cautious about framing this amendment narrowly as limited to SEP contributions to MediSave through the CAYE mechanism. The 1992 second reading resulted in this narrow policy position. But in reality, the Parliamentary intent in 1968 was to for SEPs to be covered by CPF in general, and, of course, MediSave did not even exist back then.Third, I urge Parliament to affirm that one part of the intent of this Bill is to permanently have SEPs contribute to CPF – that is the plain reading of section 9A – with the appropriate discretion to Government in terms of how this is to be implemented over time.I have heard the Minister’s opening speech and I acknowledge that the Government’s policy position has not changed. SEPs are only required to contribute to MediSave. Nonetheless, I believe we must aim for broader coverage and protection for SEPs in the goodness of time. We do not want, I think, another 24 years to pass where no progress is made on SEP CPF coverage, at least not without good reasons. Otherwise, we might as well just limit this CPF (Amendment) Bill to MediSave contributions only, if there is no intent to eventually move towards full CPF coverage of SEPs.I will now turn to the economic reasons supporting this Bill. Sir, according to MOM’s Own Account Workers Survey, there were 190,900 residents engaged in own account work or self-employment as their primary job in 2017. If you look at the profile you will find that they are generally older and less educated; slightly more than half are aged 50 and above, and 60% have less than tertiary education. Actually, relatively few work in the so-called gig economy; most are taxi drivers, insurance and real estate agents, and other traditional self-employment vocations.Sir, I will set aside for now the problem of SEPs who earn very low or intermittent incomes and who, as a result, have difficulty setting aside any funds for social protection. The solution for them must be improving non-contributory social protection schemes such as the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme, and of course skills upgrading. The CAYE scheme is not their remedy.My interest is in SEPs who have the earning capacity to contribute to their own social protection. In 2017, nearly 60% of primary own account workers earned more than $20,000 a year, and 40% earned more than $30,000 a year. Employees who earn such incomes are able to contribute for their own CPF. So, the CAYE scheme must eventually give such higher-earning SEPs the same coverage that employees obtain from CPF today.The basic reasons why SEPs should be covered by CPF are the same as that for employees. There are behavioural biases which make it difficult for us to set aside funds for our retirement and future needs. We may want to save for the future, but we face self-control problems, so spending money today always seems easier than saving money for tomorrow. We may be loss averse, so taking money out of our pockets and locking it away as CPF savings is psychologically difficult.What makes saving uniquely difficult for SEPs is that they receive income today, but must pay CPF contributions tomorrow. CPF assessments are finalised based on the preceding year’s Net Trade Income. This means that by the time CPF contributions are assessed and due, SEPs have long since received their income. They may have cash flow problems. They may believe that CPF contributions are an out-of-pocket loss. Employees, by contrast, do not have this problem. Because their CPF contributions are deducted from salaries at source, employees do not experience the same cash flow problems, or the same sense of loss, as SEPs do. The CAYE mechanism will overcome these problems.There is an additional broader economic benefit of CAYE. Today, SEPs earn higher take-home wages than employees for doing the same kinds of work. For example, taxi drivers may receive higher take-home incomes than bus drivers do. This is not just because of differences in thecost structure of SEPs, such as the lack of employee benefits. The main reason is that CPF contributions reduce the take-home income of employees. Of course, an employee’s total wages, which includes CPF contributions, may, in fact, be higher than that of an equivalent SEP. But it is natural for workers to make decisions based on take-home wages, since this can be spent immediately.This wage differential between SEPs and employees in equivalent work may distort the labour market. It may explain why so many Singaporeans have found gig economy jobs attractive in recent years. It contributes to the ease with which such gig economy platforms recruit workers away from traditional employment. It may also encourage an unnecessary and inefficient shift in the labour market towards self-employment, especially if firms have a lower wage bill for SEPs because they can get away with paying less, and still pay higher take-home wages – there is no CPF contribution to deduct. CAYE, when implemented, will reduce the gap between SEPs and employees in take-home wages, and will help to reduce the effect of this important distortion in wages.However, there is also potential for CAYE to be applied more creatively to help our SEPs contribute to CPF and manage their finances. A common problem with SEPs is that they face highly variable incomes. For example, an external school sports coach for our schools may have to conduct training sessions continuously in the run-up to competitions but have low demand for their services during exams. Our taxi and private-hire drivers have large differences in daily earnings depending on the weather, weekends and public holidays, and so on. This is a problem of feast or famine. While employees enjoy a steady income, SEPs are exposed to peaks and troughs in income.CAYE could be used to help SEPs manage their incomes, by taking a greater share of contributions from high earning periods, and lower contributions or even no contributions, when earnings are low. Consider a full-time private hire driver. She might earn just enough to cover expenses on bad days. It would not be practical or desirable to levy CAYE contributions then. But on good days, she might earn enough profit that she would gladly contribute to CPF to save for the future. A well-designed CAYE could allow SEPs to contribute to CPF with significantly less pain than a flat contribution rate would.This concept is built on proven research and practice. The Nobel-prize winning behavioural economist Richard Thaler, together with Shlomo Benartzi, proposed a similar programme called “Save More Tomorrow” that asks people to commit to saving more out of future income, rather than present income. In a paper published in the Journal of Political Economy in 2004, they found that offering the chance to save for retirement starting with future pay raises, rather than present income, substantially increased both participation in retirement savings, and savings rates. However, the concept must be adapted to the needs of SEPs. Singapore can take the lead in showing that we can sustainably provide social protection even for gig economy workers and other emerging types of employment in the future economy.Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this CPF (Amendment) Bill will significantly improve social protection for self-employed persons. I urge Parliament to affirm that we should move eventually towards full coverage of self-employed persons through the CPF system. I support the Bill.5.56 pmMr Deputy Speaker: Yes, Mr Ang Hin Kee.Mr Ang Hin Kee: Mr Speaker, Sir, can I make a point of clarification?Mr Deputy Speaker: Yes. What is it regarding?Mr Ang Hin Kee: It is for the hon Member Assoc Prof Daniel Goh. It is on a point which he made earlier. I just wanted to check if I heard it correctly and get some clarification from him.Mr Deputy Speaker: Please go ahead.Mr Ang Hin Kee: Assoc Prof Daniel Goh earlier mentioned that some employers of, for example, taxi operators, and the likes of it, provide some kind support and maybe even uniform to the drivers, who therefore, they should be classified as employees and given statutory protection such as CPF contributions and the likes of it. I wonder if that is correct? If that is correct, would the operators today be alarmed that what they did voluntarily – which we hadpersuaded them by saying: can you co-contribute to the MediSave of the taxi drivers; can you provide subsidies for their uniforms–would now change and they should therefore make them their employees and start granting them paid leave, changing the entire model from a freelance one to an employee model. This is because that will fundamentally change the structure of the taxi industry from one where the majority are freelancers to one where these freelancers are employees.Mr Deputy Speaker: Are you rebutting him?Mr Ang Hin Kee: I would like to have his clarification on whether that was a suggestion from him in the speech he made earlier.Mr Deputy Speaker: Okay, Assoc Prof Daniel Goh.Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I am not alluding to taxi companies because they are not platform companies, so to speak.I am talking about the case of Australia where because of the gig economy and the use of online technologies and platform engagement technologies, there are certain features that come of that, in which self-employed workers start to look like employees because of certain kinds of incentives and membership-tiering, and all these kinds of features, and also the kind of conditions that are being placed on the self-employed workers to adopt. So, the direction and the dependency on the companies' control and direction is an important criteria in judging whether these are actually employees and not contract workers. That is the test of dependency. I am not really talking about current taxi operators and what not, but platform companies.Mr Deputy Speaker: Yes, Mr Ang.Mr Ang Hin Kee: One further point of clarification. Grab and Gojek and the likes of Uber are platform operators. When they came into the Singapore scene, we spent quite a lot of time to persuade them to co-contribute to the MediSave; to find ways to support them in their training; to support them for their healthcare needs although they are freelance drivers. They know for a fact that they are freelancers, but these platform operators actually provided support because we persuaded them to do so and they saw the logic of doing so. So, is Assoc Prof Goh suggesting that these platform operators, such as Gojek and Grab, therefore treat their drivers now as employees?Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong: Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am suggesting that the Government consider the use of the test of dependency to look at the classification of the self-employed workers to see whether they fit into certain models of employment and I do not think that is very different from what you have actually called for yourself.Mr Deputy Speaker: Do you want to ask him for more clarifications or are you answering his query?Mr Ang Hin Kee: I just want to clarify his interpretation of what I called for.What I called for is that there are certain groups of freelancers, for example, food delivery riders, who are asked to come at certain hours, take the equipment, wear the uniform, and do the work as though they are employees. But the same platform operators, whether Grab or Gojek, also offer options whereby drivers become freelancers. So, the same platform can, on the one hand, offer people genuine bona fidefreelance arrangements, but because they were persuaded to and gladly make some contributions to the riders in order that they work with you on a long-term basis and they gladly do so, but we do not consider them as employees. For riders doing food delivery, that is something which I called for, indeed.Mr Deputy Speaker: I think this is an interpretation of the term \"employment\" by the Courts, so we will leave it to the Courts or MOM to make a decision on it. Can I have the next speaker? Mr Arasu.6.00 pmMr Arasu Duraisamy (Nominated Member): Mr Deputy Speaker, the main focus of the proposed amendments to the Central Provident Fund Act is to introduce the Contribute-As-You-Earn scheme or CAYE for short. If executed well, CAYE could be a welcome step in streamlining the payment contribution process to MediSave for Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) and helping SEPs better manage their cashflow.This is a timely amendment and answers a key concern of SEPs, who do not have the certainty of finding consistent work and face more difficulties than the average salaried employee in saving regularly for their healthcare needs.While SEPs’ MediSave contribution rates remain the same, CAYE changes the payment process itself by having service buyers contribute regular payments to MediSave on SEPs’ behalf. To ensure that SEPs are not made worse off by the introduction of this system, we must exercise care in operationalising CAYE.We need to make sure that the CAYE system is understandable and easy to navigate for SEPs. Details of the payment process and even the online interface for payments must be made simple and clear, for both SEPs and service buyers.At the same time, the educational outreach to SEPs and service buyers must be effective, in order to make the transition as smooth as possible. In the pilot phase, outreach can be focused on SEPs and Government Procurement Entities (GPEs). However, in future phases where more SEPs may be affected, we need to ensure that the outreach extends to SEPs and service buyers in different industries and through different channels.Also, affected SEPs should be consulted before the launch of CAYE in each phase, to ensure that the process is understood and pre-emptively iron out any potential wrinkles that may be highlighted during the consultation.SEPs have widely different relationships with their clients and have different degrees of dependence on intermediaries. Also, SEPs can be paid per task or have their payments contractually scheduled over a period of time. This means that CAYE may not work as well or in the same way for each group of SEPs. To ensure a high level of compliance, consultations should be held with as many different types of groups as possible prior to implementation. MOM should also consider creating a one-stop resource to provide relevant information and to allow SEPs to submit queries relating to their CAYE contributions.Some SEPs have expressed concern about CAYE potentially increasing existing delays to payments owed to them, due to the additional logistical arrangements that need to be made by the service buyer. I understand that the CAYE payment process is meant to be easy and automated, so service buyers should not have to use CAYE as an excuse to delay payments. Will MOM consider introducing penalties for undue payment delays, to encourage prompt payments by service buyers, and GPEs in particular for the pilot phase?I have another question. I understand that the pilot phase will allow companies in private sector to voluntarily adopt the CAYE scheme. How about individual SEPs? Some SEPs who are not within the pilot phase may want to participate voluntarily as they see this system as beneficial for their MediSave needs. Will these SEPs able to sign up for CAYE and compel their service buyers to opt in to this system for them?Beyond CAYE, more can be done to support SEPs holistically. I have previously advocated for the compulsory provision of work injury insurance by service buyers to ensure that SEPs have recourse if they suffer injuries in the course of their employment. There are some notable examples of private companies who provide prolonged medical insurance for the SEPs working on their platforms. More can be done to encourage service buyers to provide insurance coverage for SEPs, as this promotes healthy sustainability and even growth for the industry.Even if SEPs end up with the responsibility of procuring insurance coverage for themselves, we need to help responsible SEPs who purchase such insurance guard against undercutting by peers who do not. This is particularly relevant in higher-risk occupations. Service buyers and GPEs should be encouraged to factor suchcosts in, to minimise undercutting and provide a more level playing field for SEPs.To conclude, Sir, I hope CAYE is mobilised effectively, to make the transition painless and help every SEP better save for their own and family members’ healthcare needs.While the principle of personal responsibility remains key for SEPs who have chosen this path, we can and should strengthen our support for SEPs, to help make self-employment sustainable and to celebrate the contributions of this diverse and dynamic group of workers in the Singapore economy.We will continue to advocate for the institutional support for SEPs because every worker matters. I stand in support of the Bill.6.06 pmMr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol): Mr Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please.(In Malay)[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]:I support the proposed amendments to this Bill, which will ensure that the CPF system remains relevant to the changes in the job landscape and employment practices.There are many challenges faced by freelancers or self-employed persons, who are estimated to number around 200,000. Many shared that their top worry is whether they can find enough work and having income stability. In fact, one out of four self-employed persons is unable to keep up with their obligations to contribute to their MediSave account annually.I welcome the amendments that will help about 6,000 self-employed persons who provide services to the Government to make automatic MediSave contributions through a Contribute-As-You-Earn (CAYE) scheme. I have a number of questions.Firstly, some of them may have difficulty making this contribution, as it would affect their income. Would they be given assistance, particularly those who have payment arrears?Secondly, would MOM allow this group to voluntarily opt-in if the self-employed persons in a specific industry collectively agree to participate in this scheme even if they are providing services to the private sector?Thirdly, would there be incentives provided to encourage this group to make their MediSave contribution?On the CPF Retirement Sum Scheme, could MOM share the reasons why it could not give members the option of choosing the CPF payout duration? Are there members who wish to shorten their CPF payout duration in order to receive a higher monthly payout to pay for their daily expenditure?(In English): Mr Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding my queries and suggestions, I support all the amendments to the CPF Act and the update to the CPF Retirement Scheme.6.09 pmMs Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast): Mr Deputy Speaker, in Singapore, over the last 10 years, the trend on the number of self-employed persons (SEPs) that make up the resident workforce is between 8% and 10%. This number is not large but with increasing digitalisation of the economy and the technological disruptions, employment practices are changing and this trend could shift.The Tripartite Workgroup's (TWG) Recommendation on Self-employed Persons cited autonomy as the reason that \"some 80%\" of SEPs in Singapore have chosen self-employment over being a regular employee.SEPs are their own bosses. The attractiveness of being your own boss and reaping the rewards when you succeed does come with a set of challenges and the focus of today's Bill, while there are other challenges like business risks and all that that SEPs face together, with the regularity of income, the focus of today's Bill is on the healthcare and savings for retirement.Clause 5 of the Bill seeks to amend the Act to provide for the Contribute-As-You-Earn (CAYE) Scheme. This will allow for certain persons called \"collectors\" making revenue payment to self-employed persons to be required to make contributions to the CPF funds of self-employed persons as outlined in the new section 9B.While I am supportive of the Amendment, I do have some comments and clarifications with regards to the CAYE Scheme.The Minister announced that the CPF Pilot for CAYE will start in January 2020 with SEPs providing services directly to the Government or the public sector. This will impact some estimated 6,000 SEPs. This will help this group of SEPs providing direct services to the Government or public sector make smaller and regular contributions to their MediSave, and as such when these payments are made when the SEP receives payment for his or her services. This will minimise the risk of the SEPs of not being able to make lump-sum contributions on an annual basis. So, for the contributions made, there will also be more MediSave Account interest earned.There is however a very short time for SEPs providing services to the Government or the public sector to plan for this change as January 2020 is less than two months away. Some SEPs may face transitional cashflow impact. Will there be any assistance provided to SEPs if required and how? Minister did say that those who have kept up with their MediSave contributions or the installment plans for their MediSave contributions will be given the option to opt out of the Pilot and I assume if they wanted to to start later.But for those who do have difficulties, what help would be provided? As previously reported, one in four self-employed persons has not kept up with their MediSave obligations annually. For the SEPs who are facing financial difficulties and are unable to make contributions for the outstanding amounts to their MediSave, the Minister did mention that some help will be given for those who are behind in their contributions to catch up. Can Minister elaborate what help this would be because they were not be given the option to opt out?SEPs are a very diverse group. Feedback received from self-employed persons during the Tripartite Workgroup public consultation identified lack of CPF savings for healthcare and retirement needs as one of the common challenges faced by SEPs. The CAYE Scheme, I believe, is a practical way to support SEPs address this challenge. So, if the CAYE Pilot Scheme does prove effective in supporting SEPs make regular MediSave contributions, when will the scheme be extended to the private sector? Mr Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding my clarifications and comments, I do support the Bill.Mr Deputy Speaker: Minister Josephine.6.14 pmMrs Josephine Teo: Mr Deputy Speaker, let me thank the Members for their comments and for supporting this Bill. I also want to thank Assoc Prof Walter Theseira in particular for his extensive research that allowed him to share a very interesting piece of legislative history concerning intent for self-employed persons. I must say that Members' enthusiastic comments are going to make my response a little longer than I originally expected.Some comments, of course, perhaps, are not directly related to this Bill. I invite Members to file Parliamentary Questions so we can address them properly. One of Assoc Prof Daniel Goh's questions was recently addressed by my colleague, Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad, during the debate on Work Injury Compensation Act. I believe the Member did not speak on the Act but he had quite a lot of questions there and they have also been addressed, so I shall not repeat them.Let me now turn to the comments related to this Bill. Members of the House have acknowledged that the Contribute-As-You-Earn pilot will help SEPs meet their MediSave obligations more easily through smaller and more regular contributions.We continue to work on addressing other common challenges faced by SEPs, as identified by the Tripartite Workgroup on SEPs in 2018.Member Mr Arasu raised the point on payment delays. These and other payment-related disputes can happen because of unclear contract terms. As such, we have launched the Tripartite Standard on Contracting with SEPs to reduce payment-related disputes. We also introduced a template on the key terms of engagement to shape contracting norms.Assoc Prof Daniel Goh seemed to dismiss the number of companies that have already signed on to this standard. I would humbly remind him that actually sometimes the buyers of services of SEPs are individuals like you and me – the plumber that comes to the home, someone who does an odd job.If we think about it, actually, it would be quite unrealistic to expect individual service buyers to sign on to the Tripartite Standard. The fact that already so many service buyers have come on-board is not a small step that has been accomplished. Of course, we will continue to build on it but I hope he will not dismiss it too lightly. There is a lot of effort involved, and if he would like to get involved with promoting it, we welcome it too.In addition, we have supported the development of skills training, both technical and non-technical, for SEPs. Relevant Skills Framework that SkillsFuture Singapore puts out now take into account the needs of SEPs.To protect SEPs from the loss of income due to prolonged illness or injury, we have worked with insurers to introduce prolonged medical leave (PML) products.I am pleased to update both Mr Arasu and Assoc Prof Daniel Goh that close to 30,000 SEPs are now covered by PML insurance. Keep in mind that this product is relatively new to the market. So, 30,000 is really not a bad start. This is already about half of those in occupations like private-hire car drivers and taxi drivers.As to whether the take-up can increase, certainly, we will be keen to promote it. But we have to leave it to the SEPs to decide for themselves whether and to what degree self-employment is their main source of income, for which PML protection is important. Keep in mind that quite a lot of them have other sources of income. Also, for some of the SEPs, it will always be the case that they assess that their risks are very low and they would rather not have to incur the upfrontcosts of PML.To complete the follow-up to the Tripartite Workgroup's recommendations, we are now piloting CAYE. The pilot allows us to try out this new system among a small group of about 6,000 SEPs, gather feedback from users and iron out any glitches, as Mr Ang pointed out.Mr Patrick Tay, Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Zainal Sapari asked if CAYE could be extended to the private sector. Mr Arasu asked if they can volunteer instead. Currently, there are no plans to extend CAYE to the private sector. We can decide later, depending on the results of the pilot. But those who wish to volunteer are welcome to approach us to explore.Similarly, we can consider Mr Patrick Tay's suggestion to explore extending the scope of the Trade Unions Act to SEPs if supported by the associations.Assoc Prof Walter Theseira is in favour of extending compulsory CPF contributions to Ordinary and Special Account savings. But he also said in the goodness of time, but not 24 years. As I was listening to him, Assoc Prof Daniel Goh's expression of concerns about SEPs' retirement adequacy came to mind, and I wondered if he or the Workers' Party has a view on Assoc Prof Walter Theseira's suggestion. Does the Member also feel that in order to boost retirement adequacy for Self-Employed Persons, he would support and would call for the extension of their contribution obligations to the Ordinary as well as the Special Account? It would be interesting to hear from the Member, since he expressed a concern about SEPs' retirement adequacy.I should say that, currently, the Government has no plans to extend CPF contribution obligations for SEPs to the Ordinary and Special Account. However, we will continue to encourage voluntary CPF contributions from SEPs. Assoc Prof Daniel Goh's suggestion on incentives to boost retirement savings is really not new, it is something we have been studying and I hope to be able to give Members an answer in the goodness of time.Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Zainal Sapari, Mr Ang Hin Kee, the Labour Movement and leaders of the SEP associations suggested providing support for SEPs when they participate in CAYE. As I had said earlier, the Government is studying their suggestions seriously and will provide more details when ready.Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Zainal Sapari also raised an important concern that SEPs may face cashflow constraints as they transition to this new scheme. We will allow SEPs to opt out if they have been keeping up with their contributions. For the small group of about 600 affected SEPs who are not keeping up, CAYE will certainly help them to avoid snowballing arrears. If any one of them needs additional support, we are prepared to help based on the specific circumstances. We can, for example, look at their instalment plan and see whether there is room to stretch it out.Mr Patrick Tay, Assoc Prof Daniel Goh and Mr Ang Hin Kee raised the question of whether SEPs can be reclassified as employees, if I heard the Members correctly. Let me just explain that the Singapore Courts have given clarity on determining whether an individual is an employee or a SEP. The difference is Contract of Service or Contract for Service. Those are the technical references.Some of the factors used by our Courts include the degree of control exerted by the company and its ability to decide on the hours of work. I think the concept is not very different from dependency.MOM has applied this approach to determine the classification of work arrangements. For example, MOM reviewed the contract arrangement of online matching platforms such as food delivery riders from Deliveroo or FoodPanda. Based on the factors spelt out by the Courts, the workers were assessed to be self-employed. But as Mr Ang pointed out, depending on actual work arrangements, some of these workers could be employees too. So, the employees and the SEPs can co-exist on work that look very similar. We really need to drill down into the specific work arrangements and we are committed to doing so.In cases where employees have been misclassified as \"Self-Employed Persons\", please be assured that we will take the employers to task. In one case which we handled recently, a transport and logistics company was issued with a stern warning and had its work pass privileges suspended for misclassifying its driver as an SEP. Based on our investigations, the driver was in effect an employee because his employment terms indicated an employer-employee relationship in terms of the amount of control that the company exerted. The company was asked to rectify and pay back the worker what he was due, including CPF contributions.Mr Patrick Tay asked about the number of SEPs who provide services to the Government. SEPs tend to be concentrated in certain industries which Government does not regularly procure services from, for example, real estate agents and insurance agents. So, the 3% should not be considered alarming in any way.Mr Tay also asked if SEPs who are concurrently employees are still required to make CAYE contributions. Well, they are actually no different from people who hold two employee jobs. The employee will also make two streams of contributions from the two jobs. Keep in mind, however, that for all members, there is a cap on total CPF contributions. SEPs who are concurrently regular employees will not need to contribute beyond this cap if they make an application to CPF Board. So, if they want to cap it and treat it as though he was one regular employee only, they can apply to do that.We will also study Assoc Prof Walter Theseira's suggestion on allowing SEPs to vary CAYE contribution rates according to their income peaks and troughs. I must say that I find that a very interesting idea. Let us study how we can implement it.To summarise again on CAYE, there is no change to the CPF obligations of SEPs. We are simply breaking up the contributions into smaller, more manageable parts as and when the SEPs earn. Only a small proportion of SEPs are part of the pilot. These SEPs can choose to opt out and set the CAYE contribution rate to zero if they have contributed to their MediSave in full or are keeping up under an instalment plan. We have also not taken a decision whether to extend CAYE any further.Let me deal with other feedback. We will always welcome feedback on how to make our CPF system better. Therefore, I would like to thank Members of Parliament who shared their feedback on the Retirement Sum Scheme (RSS).Mr Zainal Sapari asked if members could have the option to end their payouts even earlier than what it is today. We are primarily guided by life expectancy. Shorter payout durations mean higher payouts but this comes at the expense of increased risk of outliving those payouts.In 2018, more than half of Singapore residents aged 65 were expected to live past 85 years old. This means that if RSS payouts ended just after 20 years, at age 85, more than half – the majority – of RSS members may have no CPF payouts for their remaining lives.In comparison, extending RSS payouts until age 90 at most will protect up to two in three members from outliving their payouts. This provides a reasonable level of assurance for members, while still increasing their payout amount as compared to the current RSS rules. Members also have the option of joining CPF LIFE before the age of 80 if they are personally worried about outliving their RSS payouts.To Members of the House, I seek your help to reassure your residents of the following, that there is no change to when they can receive their RSS payouts. Those who are 65 today can instruct CPF Board to start their payouts anytime. With the new rules, members already receiving RSS payouts will either get the same or higher payouts. No one will get a lower payout than they are already receiving. Members who are on CPF LIFE will not be affected at all and will continue receiving monthly payouts for life.Mr Speaker, let me say something about helping members understand how CPF works for them. The CPF caters to 3.9 million members. 150,000 employers interact with it regularly. Each member and employer is unique.Most members at different times of their lives interact with CPF Board on housing, healthcare and retirement matters. They may also use their CPF savings for investment, education and insurance. On top of all that, members may be included in the many Government schemes administered by CPF Board on behalf of other agencies. Such schemes include the Workfare Income Supplement, Silver Support Scheme, MediShield Life, GST Vouchers and so on.At the same time, CPF rules have to evolve to stay relevant. Quite often, new rules have to co-exist with old ones to honour commitments to older members. As a result, even when family members compare notes, they may get confused.Let me assure members that CPF Board is constantly striving to communicate better.This is done at three levels: through mass media channels; segmented outreach; and direct personalised communications.First, mass media. CPF Board uses multiple media channels to reach out to as many Singaporeans as possible and increase their understanding of CPF. The Board conducts regular campaigns, including in vernacular languages to clarify details of schemes, such as nominations and top-ups. The Board also uses social media to share bite-sized information with followers. Besides Facebook and Instagram posts, video series explain retirement issues in a light-hearted, easy-to-digest manner.Second, segmented outreach. The Board tailors its content to the needs of various groups. Ground outreach in the heartlands is especially important. For example, many of us would have seen CPF Board's Retirement Planning Roadshows in our neighbourhood centre or mall. These roadshows are held over five weekends across the island. This year alone, the roadshows received about 170,000 visitors.To further expand its reach, CPF Board also works with other agencies and grassroots organisations. In 2019 alone, CPF Board conducted over 60 engagement sessions for more than 6,000 grassroots leaders (GRLs) and residents. The Board trained 300 GRLs in 2019, enabling them to reach out to more than 3,000 residents right in their neighbourhoods.I would like to especially commend grassroots advisors who have been proactive in organising CPF briefings for their GRLs and residents. Dr Maliki Mohamad, for example, has personally conducted 10 sessions in Siglap and engages his audience with flipchart diagrams and slides. I think this must be continuing in the good tradition of former Minister Lim Swee Say – he was just here earlier. He also conducted many sessions in the whole of Bedok area where he serves as Member of Parliament. Ms Foo Mee Har has personally done six briefings this year alone in Ayer Rajah. Mr Murali and Ms Sim Ann have actively supported CPF ground engagements in Bukit Batok and Bukit Timah. I personally have done more than 20 sessions in Bishan North and joined in sessions organised by advisors like Er Dr Lee Bee Wah. These sessions go a long way in educating the public about CPF schemes that are relevant to them and clarify their doubts.CPF Board also conducts talks that target member segments such as young members who have just started work, the self-employed, and employers. The talks cover topics that are most relevant to each group, such as housing matters for young members who are purchasing their first homes.To provide members some idea of the materials available, CPF Board has compiled information packs which are available for your collection in the Parliament Library.Thirdly, besides mass media and segmented outreach, CPF Board uses direct personalised communications.Many members still prefer one-on-one discussions about their specific circumstances. For most members, their first point of contact will remain one of our five CPF Service Centres – in Bishan, Jurong, Maxwell, Tampines and Woodlands. In 2018 alone, these centres received one million customers. On average, that is nearly 800 every day at every service centre. Staff at these service centres are equipped to engage members in vernacular languages, even in some dialects.To bring CPF services nearer to members, especially the elderly, CPF Board sets up mobile service centres. These mobile centres move around to a new heartland location, usually the Community Centre (CC) or library, every two months. Members can make enquiries and perform a range of CPF transactions, without having to travel to a service centre.In 2019, mobile service centres were set up at six locations – Kampong Chai Chee CC, Yew Tee CC, Geylang Serai CC, Bukit Merah CC, Toa Payoh Library and the one currently running at Potong Pasir CC until the end of this year and, of course, Nee Soon CCs can be considered, too. Since this initiative started in 2016, more than 36,000 have been served.For those who prefer phone clarifications, they can contact the CPF call centre. The call centre is staffed by experienced CPF officers who can manage queries in a variety of languages. In 2018, the call centre received about 660,000 phone calls. That is about 2,750 calls per day.Other communications that goes directly to members, such as the package members receive at age 55, or letters on their RSS or CPF LIFE payouts, have been simplified and enhanced over the years. Where the member is required to take action, this is clearly indicated for the member's attention.For members reaching milestone ages, CPF Board provides personalised, face-to-face guidance as part of the CPF Retirement Planning Service. This is available to members turning 54 or reaching their payout eligibility age of 65. Members who have attended these sessions found it very helpful. Over 97% said that they would recommend it to others.CPF Board has also recently redesigned its mobile app, giving members easy access to their CPF details and transactions like making top-ups. About 350,000 members use this app.We are also constantly updating our outreach. For example, CPF Board will be putting out a series of educational posters in housing estates to clarify common CPF misconceptions. We are working with the Silver Generation Office to engage older members. We will also link these members up with other Government agencies, if necessary, such as the Social Service Offices, HDB or MOH.In summary, Deputy Speaker, communicating CPF has been and will remain a top priority for us. We welcome suggestions from Members of the House on how we can do better.With this, Deputy Speaker, I hope that I have addressed Members' questions and suggestions. And with your permission, I beg to move.Mr Deputy Speaker: Mr Ang Hin Kee.6.37 pmMr Ang Hin Kee: Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to seek some clarifications from the Minister for Manpower. There were suggestions that taxi operators and so on, should start to pay for PML premiums on behalf of drivers. I wonder what is the Ministry's take on this compulsory arrangement that some had suggested. Would it therefore lead to an increase in, say, for example, rentalcost of the vehicles? Who will ultimately pay for thecost? Will it lead to an increase in fare structure because the operator will essentially find a way to transfer this or the premium somewhere else? I wonder what is the Ministry's thinking about some of these suggestions that were made.Mrs Josephine Teo: Deputy Speaker, I thank Mr Ang for following up on this suggestion. Mr Ang knows the taxi drivers very well. I think he fully understands that when the issue of PML insurance was raised in discussions with them, the issue ofcost and who will bear it, was prominent in their minds.Mr Ang is correct to point out that thecost has to be carried by someone. It is potentially the company that leases out the taxis. But he is also very right to say from the taxi companies' point of view then, it is entirely possible that they choose to recover thesecosts through higher rentalcosts which would impact the drivers without necessarily giving them an opportunity to recover thiscost from the commuters which is why, I think, our thinking is not to be hasty about making PML insurance compulsory.I think the fact that the individuals choose to be self-employed persons, we have to give them the ability to decide for themselves what kinds of protection are relevant to them. If they were comfortable with the present arrangements and do not see much need for this kind of protection to be made compulsory, it may not be right for us to insist on it for now. Keep in mind the vast majority of self-employed persons, including taxi drivers and private hire car drivers, have chosen this livelihood as a preference. It does not mean that all of them do not wish to move into regular employment.So, our approach right now is to keep it voluntary and then, with a good base load of insured persons – in fact, the insurance premiums could be brought down, and if the insurance premiums have been brought down, then to the self-employed persons, they will do their sums and see whether it is useful to them, considering the benefits that come with it.Mr Deputy Speaker: Assoc Prof Daniel Goh.Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Just a quick response to the Minister's question. I am going to echo my fellow Assoc Prof and say that, yes, in the goodness of time.Mrs Josephine Teo: I thank Assoc Prof Daniel Goh for his clarity and in the goodness of time, if this should come to pass, I hope he will give his strong support too.Question put, and agreed to.Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. – [Mrs Josephine Teo].Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed."

        "Content": "The Chairman: Head I, Ministry of Social and Family Development. Mr Seah Kian Peng.Improvements to Social Safety NetMr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade): Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".Today, there are many community agencies on the ground providing a variety of support services to those in need, from family matters to financial aid and also healthcare. Local Community Development Councils (CDCs) have schemes in place for both short-term and long-term assistance.As social needs become more complex, individuals in need will require multiple forms of social support, which are being provided by different community agencies today. This can be an advantage – that agencies specialise in order to help individuals with specific problems. It increases efficiency and reduces transaction time on the part of people seeking help.At the same time, problems do not respect bureaucratic borders – individuals that need help may not necessarily have the time and effort to \"code-switch\" across these agencies, whether it is about filling up forms or registering for means testing. Instead, they may delay their applications, sometimes causing their own situation to worsen by the time they seek help. This is certainly far from ideal. We do not want our social safety net to fail where it is most crucially needed.On the other hand, there are also many different Singaporeans who want to contribute their time and money, but may not be able to commit for the long term, or at regular intervals. We should not ignore this important group of volunteers which add up to a significant number of volunteer hours. Again, the complexity exists on the supply end of this issue.We need some special, specific and granular mechanisms to bridge complexity at both ends – coordination, planning and organisation. We can all do better if there are plans to help direct these efforts and other community efforts through better coordination and sharing of information about individuals and families in need in the community. Can Minister give an update on these plans?If we fail to coordinate, there will be continued frustration, unmet urgent needs and a general sense of helplessness among many communities. But if we succeed, the outcome is both powerful and simple – a stronger, more beautiful fabric of Singapore, woven by all of us together.Question proposed.Transforming our Social Safety NetChairman, the Government has put in place many schemes and services to support Singaporeans in building strong families including various marriage preparation programmes for couples looking to get married. But some young people looking to get married get caught up in the romance and the emotions of the moment. They do not have the time nor the inclination to plan and prepare.One useful way is to review the marriage courses available on the Registry of Marriage's website. I note that some of themcost about $300 and the titles include one called \"Evidence-based Marriage Programme\". Another is titled \"PREP\" or Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Programme. All this sounds like a cautionary tale. I am not sure, even after reading the syllabus, exactly what it is that the course is trying to prevent.But some of the classes, \"Negotiation and Conflict Resolution\", for example, it is very useful indeed, especially like how the website said that the course was \"proven to sustain up to five years\" after the programme. I wonder what happens after five years.I must assure Members of the House that I support these courses and I do think they are useful. But we must not approach them in the same benefit-and-cost analysis manner that we do in courses.There is no KPI. If a marriage is abusive and unhappy, surely the best outcome is to step out of it. Divorce should not be seen as a failure but an option in human relationships.Strong marriages are important to a nationas well as to couples themselves. We must start conversations about what strong marriages mean as well as how to build it. This, to me, is the true benefit of preparation courses.Some of these coursescost a few hundred dollars and I understand that the Government provides a subsidy of $70. How can the Government make these programmes more accessible and affordable to better support couples in building strong foundations for their families?Tackling Social Challenges TogetherMs Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar): Mr Chairman, Singapore's social challenges are turning complicated and complex. The new normal is the recognition that Government can no longer do it alone.Even the supposedly simple issue of \"feeding the hungry\" is, in truth, not as simple as it appears. The recent CNA documentary on \"Food Insecurities\" showed up problems such as overlapping of help efforts; reluctance of donors to work with each other; and wastage of donated items.I myself have been involved in issues such as coordinating senior services and helping cardboard collectors in my constituency and district – not easy. MSF Minister Desmond Lee himself has personally led in bringing together groups to solve social concerns such as rough sleepers and also food distribution to the poor. We have to find a formula that goes beyond the interest, passion and intervention of a heroic Minister.Tackling social challenges together, especially more challenging wicked ones, calls for several critical success factors: a strong sponsor who can back with the right links; a systems thinking approach; clarity in problem statement; an understanding of the overall landscape, driving and restraining forces; a strong facilitator; and implementation discipline for results.MSF should be given resources to start an establishment that is nimble and competent enough to facilitate and pull in the right internal and external resources to address identified prioritised social challenges – a SWAT team of sorts.I seek the Ministry's inputs on how it intends to lead and facilitate the imperative of tackling social challenges together with others in the community. What are the outcomes and obstacles to date?Ending Food Insecurity and MalnutritionAssoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member): Chairman, Singapore was ranked by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the fourth most food-secure nation in the world. Yet nearly half of a sample of 236 families in Singapore reported moderate to severe food insecurity. These were the findings of the 2018 report \"Hunger in a Food Lover's Paradise\" by the Lien Centre for Social Innovation at SMU. The report finds no lack of help. There were some 125 food support groups operating in Singapore, in addition to food support from ethnic self-help groups and community organisations.A basic question is how much food is enough. But the question is, enough for what?The 2019 Minimum Income Standards study led by Dr Ng Kok Hoe of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy found that a single elderly household requires about $400 a month for food, about 29% of their budget. More importantly, that study reveals that Singaporeans consider food to be more than calories for the body; it is nourishment for the soul. It includes having meaningful choice and variety, the opportunity to eat healthily but also enjoy the occasional indulgence and the chance to meet friends at the hawker centre or to invite others to a home-cooked meal. It is not three restaurant meals a day. It is three meals with dignity.Despite good intentions, charity struggles to meet these varied needs. Esther, a retiree, told CNA Insider in a report on food insecurity published this month, and I quote: \"We can’t give feedback because the food is free… It feels like we are beggars, what they give, we must eat.\" But Esther has diabetes and high blood pressure. She needs a healthier diet for her health conditions. She does not always have a meaningful choice. Chairman, with your permission, may I display a slide on the LCD screen.The Chairman: Yes, please. [A slide was shown to hon Members.]Assoc Prof Walter Theseira: Thank you, Sir. Ms Diana Ong from the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC) conducted a study under the mentorship of Dr Ong Qiyan from the Social Service Research Centre at NUS. The purpose was to understand consumption of food in 77 low-income Chinese families with young children. They found that families who ate a healthier diet – more fresh fruits, vegetables and meat, less processed food – spent significantly more each month than families who did not – $204 per capita, per month, instead of $168. The big difference in spending is not in eating out. It is in trying to eat a healthier home-cooked diet.These results are consistent with the food insecurity-obesity paradox: that in a rich country, food insecurity manifests not as starvation, but as an inadequate and unhealthy diet that exposes the poor to risks of obesity and malnutrition. And when children are affected by a less healthy diet, as in the CDAC study, then these consequences can last a lifetime.What can government food aid achieve? Research from the United States has found that government food stamps reduced food insecurity, increased birth weight, improved children’s health, and even reduced metabolic linked diseases such as obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes, many years down the road, for people who benefited from food stamps when they were children.So, Budget 2020’s initiative to grant $100 in grocery vouchers, for two years, for needy Singaporeans is a step in the right direction. But much more can be done if addressing food insecurity is made a priority of government policy, rather than left to voluntary groups.Food Insecurity in SingaporeMr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member): Chairman, this cut concerns food insecurity in Singapore. Individuals are food insecure when they are not confident of having economic and physical access to sufficient acceptable food for a healthy life. CNA recently did a feature on food insecure families as cited by Members previously, and I have three specific questions.First, above the $100 in grocery vouchers between FY 2020 and FY 2021, is the Ministry implementing any long-term programme to reduce the number of food insecure households in Singapore?Secondly, with regard to our \"Many Helping Hands\" approach, has (a) the Ministry identify any gaps in our food insecure population currently not served by any Ministry or NGO; and (b) has the Ministry identified areas for improved coordination and efficiency, which require further funding or investment?Thirdly, what efforts are being taken by the Ministry to ensure that our food insecure households are able to afford healthy and nutritious food? What additional investment is required to improve access to nutritious food? Does the Ministry intend to make these investments?Rental Flat ResidentsAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member): Chairman, Sir, last year's Household Expenditure Survey revealed that between 2013 and 2018, Singaporeans living in 1-room and 2-room flats have increased their monthly spending by 3.7% on average, while families in private apartments saw expenditure fall by 0.1%. Households living in landed property, who spent nearly 5% more on average every year between 2008 and 2013, tightened the purse strings to spending just 0.2% more every year between 2013 and 2018.Singstat also reported that households in the lowest 20% income group experienced an expenditure increase which was more than their income growth. If this trend continues, it does not bode well for the financial well-being of lower income households even when income inequality is mitigated.Does MSF have a programme to track the income, expenditures and financial well-being of lower income HDB residents? Tracking such data can help MSF provide better and targeted assistance.Sir, according to Household Expenditure Survey, expenditure on Housing and Utilities make up 14.4% of total expenditure for households living in 1-room and 2-room flats. This is much higher than the 8.1% on average for all HDB households. In absolute terms, the average household expenditure per household member on Housing and Utilities for those living in 1-room and 2-room flats is higher than those living in 4-room and 5-room flats. This is quite anomalous and warrants study, as housingcosts should be a progressive burden and not tax the lower income more.Coordination Care ProvisionMr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio): Mr Chairman, the past two years have seen the production of several media shows that highlighted the complex social issues that Singapore faces, and in that process, offered us a deeper glimpse into the challenges and struggles that some Singapore families have to grapple with.Channel News Asia’s thought-provoking documentaries, \"Don’t Call Us Poor\", \"Inside the Children’s ICU\", and \"Inside the Child Protective Service\" have highlighted the crucial point that there will never be a simple solution, there will never be a simple solution to tackle social issues because of the inherent complex inter-dependencies that reside in them. Indeed, these could be what philosopher and management scholar, C West Churchman, referred to as \"wicked problems\".5.15 pmClassic examples of wicked problems include economic, environmental, political and social problems whose solution requires a great number of actors to come together to deliver a holistic whole-of-the-problem solution. Wicked problems are impossible to resolve in a piecemeal manner as the inherent complex inter-dependencies that exist between the variables in these problems will render any effort to solve one aspect of the problem to reveal or create other problems.Singapore has always adopted the \"many helping hands\" approach when it comes to community assistance. Many community agencies on the ground provide a variety of support services to those in need, from family matters to financial aid and even healthcare. As social needs become more complex however, individuals and families in need may require multiple forms of social support, which could be provided by different community agencies today.I would like to ask the Government are there plans to help these individuals and families through better coordination and sharing of information across Government agencies, NGOs and VWOs?Support for Families in NeedDr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar): There are many families who are in need in our society. They face many issues, such as financial inadequacy, poor health, low education, unemployment, single parenthood, many members to support, physical or mental disability and so on. According to a survey, there are least 20% of Singaporeans who are earning less than their monthly expenditure. Many families, when faced with multiple problems and stresses, become overwhelmed and ill equipped to care and provide for their children. These children will not enjoy the same fighting chance as their better-off peers, and thus may grow up to be in the same predicament as their parents if intervention and help are not rendered in time or in a sustainable manner.These families require intensive, holistic and coordinated assistance. Would MSF look into the following issues of such families?One, how do we identify such families? Has there been any survey done to see how many of such families who are in need? We need to know who they are before we can reach out to them. Can MSF provide the resources for good outreach to touch base with these families, to understand their needs, to assist them with their urgent needs and to coordinate and follow-up with them in a sustainable manner? These families need intense hand holding, because just informing them on the many assistance schemes that they can tap on will not work for them.Two, do we have plans and effective programmes in place that are able to collectively solve the needs of these families in areas such as financial, education of children, medical health referrals, childcare placement, re-employment and so on. More social workers who can understand the needs of each family, sorting out the families' issues; by tapping into the various Government schemes, by working and coordinating with social service agencies (SSAs) to benefit these families.Three, do we have an upstream measure in place to handhold such families? Many of these families have disadvantaged children that need longer follow-up, especially the young children. The reason is that such families may have entrenched problems that cannot be solved overnight. Priority must be given to their children in their well-being as they grow up especially in their education, health and character development. Our system must be robust to ensure that these children are on track to get out of their families' predicament and the chance to climb the social ladder or to break the poverty cycles.Four, a higher percentage of the children of these families is not in pre-schools when it is even more crucial for them to do so. Can MSF ensure that all of these children are placed in pre-schools? Evidence shows that the developmental years, especially the first few years of a child's life are fundamentally important. Special attention and assistance given to the first few years of children's lives lead to better economic, social and emotional benefits later on.In disadvantaged families, many parents are unable to support their children's education due to limited resources and their own educational level. Others tend to be permissive and take a hands-off approach. This results in higher absenteeism from schools. These families and children need closer follow-up and supervision by MSF.Five, many community agencies on the ground can be roped in to provide a variety of support services to those families in need, from family matters to financial aid and even healthcare. As social needs become more complex, individuals in needs may require multiple forms of social support, which could be provided by the different community agencies today.Are there plans to help direct these efforts through better coordination and sharing of information about individuals or families in need in the community? Comprehensive assistance can be facilitated by data and digital technologies, on implementations and on follow-up. I hope MSF can facilitate the adoption and wider use of such technology. This will enable good coordination and good outreach to families in need by the various agencies, but more importantly, it is to spread the resources for better coverage and to prevent duplication or uneven distribution of help.Social service agencies are critical partners in providing such support programmes and services to help individuals and families overcome their difficult circumstances. The social service sector will have to adopt more productive and innovative processes, as well as continually build up new competencies. What are the Ministry's plans to strengthen capability development amongst social service agencies, to meet growing social needs?Six, there is higher chance of those from low-income single parent families of being disadvantaged. Can there be priority given to these families to assist their children better?Seven, there are more transnational families who belong to the families in need. Apart from assisting their children's education and well-being, the spouses of these families also require hand holding assistance in finding employment.Helping Rough Sleepers in in Public AreasMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok): Sir, the reasons why people may sleep in public places instead of their homes are manifold and be complex. I quote the hon Member of Parliament, Dr Lily Neo on a speech during theCOSdebates in 2018. She said, \"Many of them may have a variety of problems, such as family feuds, HDB housing issues, mental issues, employment and financial issues\".In response, the hon Minister for Social and Family Development, Mr Desmond Lee stated, \"We need a more coordinated, whole-of-society approach to address the underlying issues and needs of these individuals. MSF works closely with other frontline agencies and the community to reach out and coordinate the help that they need.\" This approach makes eminent sense.Currently, however, the issue still persists. In the LKY School of Public Policy report published in November 2019, it was revealed that there are about 1,000 rough sleepers on the streets of Singapore. The report also identified that a good number of rough sleepers have residences but decided not to stay at home for one reason or another.I recently came across one such case. I tried to persuade the rough sleeper, who refused to go back home owing to a combination of family and mental health issues, to go to a shelter instead. However, he refused. Over time, he became more and more frail. This was obviously concerning. Now he is missing and that is doubly concerning.I would like to suggest that MSF be given more legislative support to enable it to intervene and help these rough sleepers to ensure their well-being. As currently worded, a \"destitute person\" under the Destitute Persons Act is defined as, inter alia, \"any idle person found in a public place, who has no place of residence\". Based on this definition, there is no ability to require a rough sleeper who has a residence to take shelter in welfare homes for the sake of his health and welfare under the Destitute Persons Act.I believe there is a case to remove the residency requirement. With the rough sleeper brought into institutionalised care, I would think there will consequently be a better opportunity to resolve the underlying issues that gave rise to him not returning to his residence.I wish to stress though that any exercise of power under the Act must be done with the health and welfare of the rough sleeper in mind.An Inclusive Break the Silence CampaignAssoc Prof Walter Theseira: Chairman, the \"Break the Silence\" campaign which you launched when you were Minister has brought crucial awareness to domestic violence issues. While many domestic violence cases fall within traditional family contexts, vulnerable groups, such as LGBTQ+ persons, face specific challenges.The NGO Sayoni found that LBTQ women are at increased risk of facing domestic violence, but they do not often seek help, due to the fear of disclosing their stigmatised identity and a lack of understanding that state institutions will protect them. Initiatives like \"Break the Silence\" often do not explicitly include LGBTQ+ persons in the campaign resources. If vulnerable groups are not represented or acknowledged, they are less likely to seek help as they may not believe their specific needs will be addressed.In 2016, The Straits Times reported that social workers \"feel ill-equipped to deal with LGBT clients\". Sayoni's research found LBTQ persons face additional challenges in seeking help because social workers may lack a sensitive understanding of their identities.For instance, Jamie, who was experiencing psychological violence from her family, approached an area-based counselling service for anger management issues. The counsellor did not directly address Jamie's anger management problem, but instead, offered to address the, I quote, \"gay problem\", thereby framing being gay as the cause of Jamie's distress. The possibility of being misunderstood or discriminated against by social workers deters many LGBTQ+ persons from seeking help.Could the next Break the Silence campaign be made more inclusive, by explicitly recognising the vulnerabilities of LGBTQ+ persons and other marginalised groups? Could the Ministry provide in-depth sensitivity training for social workers and other first responders to address the specific needs of these marginalised groups?Digital Rights for ChildrenProf Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member): Hon Members, it is my right today to speak to you for four minutes and no longer. Just as it is our right as Singaporeans to contest elections to enter this House or in my case, to be appointed. Fundamentally, rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement, stipulating what is allowed of people or owed to people according to legal doctrine, social convention or ethical theory.In Singapore, the rights of children are protected by the Children and Young Persons Act. I am glad to have been in the House when we passed the amendments to extend identity protection for young people involved in court proceedings to children aged 17 and 18. Identity protection for all our children is critical in a digitalising age. For today's young people, the digital world is ripe with opportunity but fraught with risk. I would thus like to highlight the issue of the digital rights of children.When I started researching into young people's media use 20 years ago, I was speaking to teens. In my most recent research, some of my interviewees reached just above my knee. Indeed, with device use creeping ever lower, we must think of more concerted protection for our children from commercial and sexual exploitation on online platforms.Commercial exploitation is stealthy and widespread. Children are the target of media content that shows the unboxing of attractive toys they cannot afford and the allure of fast food, fast fashion and unhealthy habits such as vaping. Young people's data is being collected and used for commercial purposes and they are aggresively marketed to across all platforms, including movies, internet connected toys, apps, online games and social media. Even in the face of COVID-19, I believe our children are under greater threat of from influencers than from influenza!More egregiously, young people are also the target of sexual grooming in online platforms and exposure to sexually explicit content.In Singapore, we have done well to ensure children's rights to access digital devices, services and digital literacy education to children from all socio-economic backgrounds. But there is much more we can do to expressly protect children's digital rights, especially in the areas of the privacy and data protection. We must take more active measures to ensure that their personal data is processed fairly, lawfully, accurately and securely, for specific purposes and with the free, explicit, informed and unambiguous consent of children and their parents. One key issue is that the terms and conditions of digital products and services are couched in obtuse language that adults cannot understand, let alone children.Given MSF's significant efforts in advancing the welfare of children, I would like to ask the Ministry to lead the charge in driving a whole-of- Government effort to recognise, concretise and protect the digital rights of children. Importantly, we should also involve our young people in the process of identifying what they believe their digital rights currently are and should be. For differently-abled children in particular, we must also develop more schemes to pioneer innovation so that they too can enjoy greater access to digital devices and services.At-risk YouthMr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar): Our children are the future capital of our nation. It is therefore important that we provide them with the resources to achieve their maximum potential in life, regardless of the starting point that they are born into.However, not every child is fortunate enough to be born into an environment filled with love. To help this group of vulnerable children, Parliament amended the Children and Young Persons Act in 2019, to strengthen support for children who have been neglected or abused. Can the Ministry provide an update on the new initiatives that have been implemented since the Act's amendment?Various studies on at-risk youths in Singapore has found that peer and family influence may have an impact in influencing youths' attitudes towards gangs and juvenile delinquency. We should therefore work towards identifying early signposts that would identify a child to be at-risk, and adopt a more preventive and integrative approach towards helping them and their families.5.30 pmBeyond the Government’s effort, I also urge community groups to come together to rally our youths and help them stay out of trouble. One good example of a community initiative targeting at-risk youths is the Delta League programme. Created in 2011, Delta League engages our youths through football during the long June and December school holidays. To keep them meaningfully occupied and away from crime, besides attending football clinics and playing matches, the youths also participate in crime prevention and other activities to enhance their awareness of crime and its consequences. Delta League marks its 10th year this year, with over 20,000 youths benefiting from its programmes in the past nine years. Some of our Delta League boys have since gone on to fulfill their dreams of becoming professional footballers. With support from MSF, I hope to see more of such initiatives from the ground to help our at-risk youths in this new decade.Chairman, we can and we must, help our vulnerable groups of children and at-risk youths to achieve their maximum potential in life, regardless of their starting point. Because in Singapore every child matters.Persons With DisabilitiesMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied): Singapore ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2013. The Government has also issued Enabling Masterplans and the leadership of some colleagues in this House towards realising this vision is well-known.Recently a disabled resident asked me to raise the topic of training and employment prospects for persons with disabilities.The Government has had schemes to boost the hiring of persons with disabilities, including the latest announcement of the Enabling Employment Credit, to provide stronger wage support for open employment. Non-governmental organisations also have initiatives such as sheltered workshops to provide training and employment.In a recent Parliamentary answer, MOM stated that the resident employment rate of persons with disabilities in the working age of 15 to 64 was about 29%, with the resident unemployment rate at 13%. What is the Government’s assessment of how far Singapore has implemented the UN Convention, particularly Article 27 on Work and Employment?Support for the Special Needs CommunityMs Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong): My son Ayden has Down Syndrome. He will be three years old in April. Time really flies but I remember vividly the emotions I felt when my husband and I were figuring out how to support his developments. We have a challenging start but found most of the information, guidance and support we needed online, through talking other parents and people in the sector.SG Enable was one of the agencies which my husband and I became familiar with very earlier on in our journey. We were informed about SG Enable through the social worker at the hospital and she helped us apply for the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) through SG Enable. In the course of my work as Member of Parliament, I found out more about the work that is done by SG Enable, especially in providing information and referral services of various schemes and providing employment support for persons with disabilities (PWDs).I believe that over the years, SG Enable has started to establish itself as a trusted partner to PWDs, their care-givers and social service agencies. It is important to build on this and make the infrastructure and services more pervasive and accessible to families.Parents sometimes find that the services and spaces that are conducive for their children with needs are not located to where they live. It would be ideal if more spaces like Enabling Village, for example, could be replicated all around Singapore.I am appreciative of the efforts that have been put in to provide support to families with children with special needs. However, what else can be done to bring greater convenience to PWDs and their care-givers in accessing social services.Third Enabling MasterplanMs Denise Phua Lay Peng: Sir, the latest Enabling Masterplan for persons with disabilities (PWDs) will be expiring in 2021.Several pieces in the Masterplan have progressed. Two workgroups, for instance, were commissioned – one to look at employment and the other on independent living. SPD President Ms Chia Yong Yong, a PWD herself and me in my volunteering capacity as ARC President and a parent of a PWD co-chair the workgroup with Minister of State Mr Sam Tan.Many Singaporeans, especially PWDs and their families are not aware of the progress of the latest Enabling Masterplan. Can the Ministry provide an update on the progress of the Masterplan and what has so far been done by the two workgroups?I would also like to focus on three other issues which are not covered by the two workgroups.First on life of PWDs after their parents' death. One common grievance by families with children with disabilities is the question of, “What would happen to my child when I am no longer around?” I have heard this at many focus groups for the last 20 years. Their worries range from financial, legal, housing, healthcare and other issues.In recent years, there are books, portals and even agencies to help families plan for the future. However, if these families are still living with worry and fear, then there is more to be done in this space. The question ought to be shifted to, “What is going to happen in the future when I am gone, and how can I shape it?”I urge MSF to assemble a team to improve the current state of future planning for families with disabled children.Next, on residential options of adults with disabilities. The current options of where adult PWDs can live and be supported appropriately, are too limiting. PWDs are expected to live with their families, with whoever relatives are left or incostly residential homes for those with higher support needs and less family support.The existing models do not cater sufficiently to a continuum of adult PWDs with varying support needs and abilities. Some interesting models like the TOUCH Ubi Hostel for PWDs are some of the best kept secrets in the community.Singapore is unique in itself in the social eco-system. Public housing is the pride of the nation and every Singaporean is encouraged to own a home. Yet, at the same time, taxation on personal income and corporate taxes are low, contributing to lower public spendings on social services, especially for PWDs compared to other countries.I urge MSF to develop our uniquely Singapore continuum of housing and support choices for PWDs depending on: the level of family support and financial ability; the level of ability of the PWD himself in independent daily living and work; and the level of support services needed by them in care supervision, healthcare, daily living and work.This will empower PWDs and families to make their choices and become part of the solution.Lastly, on community access and inclusion. Research has shown that although most people in Singapore welcome the idea of an inclusive society, not everyone is willing to or feel comfortable interacting with PWDs.Both the disability community and the rest of Singapore need to organise ourselves better for better outcomes in community access and inclusion. Can Government streamline Government-linked agencies so that there is less overlap and greater clarity to the public on the \"who\", the \"what\" and the \"how\" in disability support and inclusion?Can more \"mainstream\" services be tapped upon to increase the presence and inclusion of PWDs? For instance, can the community clubs and the grassroots movement identify PWDs and include they and their families in their midst of their activities and their plans?Can a continuum of housing options for PWDs be designed into all new and existing public housing estates so that PWDs can live with the appropriate support there, seeing and be heard and felt? Can every Government ministry appoint Disability Champions or teams to look out for and include PWDs in both their work and other parts of life?Enhance Special Needs EducationMr Desmond Choo (Tampines): It is a basic societal tenet that we should provide all children with opportunities to learn, grow and contribute to society. We need to further enhance support for children with special needs and disabilities, especially those who have early childhood intervention is especially critical.For example, the Government-subsidised Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) helps to pay for therapy and intervention programmes that typically offer up to 12 hours of intervention a week. But this is less than half of the lower bound of the range of between 25 to 40 hours a week, that some experts postulated is needed for effectiveness. Moreover, EIPIC programmes are usually not integrated with mainstream childcare programmes, where educators are largely not trained to teach children with special needs. As a result, the children may feel excluded and be deterred from interacting or participating. Such disjointed arrangements also exact a toll on working parents who have to shuttle their children back and forth from EIPIC centres to childcare and it also wears the children out as well.I will like to suggest a couple of approaches to improve the system capacity. One, we need to have more inclusive pre-schools. The initial slower pace is only to be expected because we need mainstream acceptance. Alternatively, we can consider widening the eligibility for pre-school/childcare subsidies to more private operators of schools for students with special needs under the Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers scheme. Currently, only 10 operators are listed under the scheme.Two, we can leverage on the childcare anchor operators by providing subsidies to train their educators, hire specialist therapists and upgrade their facilities to be inclusive schools.Three, we can also consider having special needs care as one of the components of teachers’ basic training.Enabling Persons of All AbilitiesMr Seah Kian Peng: Special Student Care Centres (SSCCs) offer subsidised before and after school care services for students with special needs aged seven years to 18 years. They are key to providing care-giving and educational support and skills for independent living for these Special Education (SPED) students.With the support of SSCCs, parents have more options and time available to them. SPED students are also given more opportunities to interact with their community and plan for their future. However, the number of such SSCCs remains small. The fees at $832 a month are not low.We need to ensure that such services remain affordable. Although subsidies are available for those who need them, the fees quickly run into the hundreds of dollars, with surcharges during school holiday periods.Subsidies are generous now for low-income families – those with income of less than $1,500, they get 90% subsidy. However, for those who earn more than $3,500, they get a subsidy of only 10% – leaving them to pay more than $700 each month.Families with special needs children already face many challenges. Surely, we can support them better, especially when the systems are already in place.So, I like to ask the Minister what measures are in place to ensure that SSCCs remain affordable for families who require these services, especially for those with multiple needs?Mandatory Parenting CourseMs Irene Quay Siew Ching (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like to address the challenges of teenage health, both physical and emotional, and the necessary roles that parents can play in providing a nurturing and loving environment to secure a bright future for their offsprings.Teens in Singapore face a multitude of issues ranging from body image, struggles to find their place in society, peer influence, parental pressure, physical health changes, school-related stress, bullying, substance abuse, just to name a few.Healthcare professionals caring for school-aged children and adolescents are also seeing an increased cases of eating disorders, a form of psychiatric illness with significant, life-threatening medical complications as well as teenage suicide cases.Although there are many contributing factors to these problems, I believe that parents can do more to help and support their teenagers in this challenging journey.Parenting is a complex balancing act, which requires both making hard decisions between giving the child freedom to grow and being there for them when needed.I noticed, with regret, that data from MSF showed a gradual rise in the number of children referred to MSF for various forms of abuse.Hence, there is a need for us to work on and improve parenting skills of our adults in Singapore because I believe that all parents want the best for their children. However, we should acknowledge that not all parents may be equipped with the right skillset and mindset to raise the child.Hence, I would like to propose to MSF to consider making parenting courses mandatory for all new parents and incentivise parents to attend such courses by making it a prerequisite to receive their Baby Bonus entitlements.5.45 pmI am sure that all parents in this Chamber, myself included, will agree that parenting is one of the most complex jobs out there. There is a widely held and unfounded perception that parents should or naturally know what to do to parent their children and everything will be fine as long as we love them enough. But I am sorry to say that this is not always the case. As such, I find it quite perplexing that we are not using available science, expertise and valuable experiences from those who have gone through the journey to better prepare new parents.Parenting courses will be useful to help new parents eliminate unnecessary fears of unknowns while bringing awareness to what may be expected when raising a child. It will also help them understand and learn different parenting styles for different personalities and how to engage their kids to create a supportive family structure through mindfulness and conscious parenting. At the end of the day, we should prepare our kids for what lies ahead by providing them with a strong mental, emotional and moral foundation. We cannot just leave this to MOE or MSF alone because no one can be a better role model to our children than us, parents.As a working mother with four children, I can fully understand that this is not easy. We cannot be perfect but we must keep trying and keep working on it, using the right parenting skills – like speaking to my kids sitting in the Gallery today. [Laughter.]Coming back to my speech, sorry, Chairman. They are quite a distraction.The Chairman: I can throw them out if you want me to. [Laughter.]Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching: I understand that MSF has implemented the Triple P Positive Parenting Programme nation-wide in schools and I would like to find out more about the attendance and success rates of these courses.I have attended such courses at my children's schools and a common remark from the teachers at the start of the course is that, often, the parents who do not make time or do not have the time for these programmes are the ones that the teachers need to reach out to.Sir, I believe that there are two extreme types of parents that we need to be mindful of – those that are ignorant or do not have enough time for their children, and the overly-concerned parents who subconsciously impart unnecessary stress to children, teachers and the people around them.This brings me to an enlightened quote from Dr Shefali Tsabary, a renowned clinical psychologist and writer of the award-winning New York Times bestselling book, \"The Conscious Parent – Transforming Ourselves, Empowering our Children\". Her revolutionary wisdom focuses on a parent-centric way of upbringing, rather than on the child.And I end with a quote, \"To be an awakened parent who is aware that traditional paradigms of parenting, where parent is seen as greater than the child are obsolete in the modern world, producing dysfunction and disconnections in families. When parents are aware in the present moment, learning and growing alongside their children, the entire family thrives. Free to actualise their individual destiny, each family member lives unencumbered and unafraid. Empowered with self-awareness, boundless in self-belief, liberated in self-expression, each feels free to explore, discover and manifest their authentic being.\"Reforms in the Family Justice SystemMs Rahayu Mahzam: We often hear of how children become embroiled in your parents' acrimonious divorce proceedings and are made emotional pawns. I am a lawyer in family practice and I see that happening often. In such situations, I often ask my client to think about the child's best interests. Divorcing parties are, however, often caught up in their emotions and are not able to think rationally.One area that is particularly challenging relates to arrangements of custody, care and control and access of the children. It would help processes in the family justice system better support divorcing parties and encourage more positive outcomes and arrangements.Last year, the Committee to review and enhance reforms in the family justice system submitted its recommendations to make various processes less acrimonious for families undergoing divorce, particularly for those with children. I am happy to note the announcement last week that there has been support from the public and stakeholders and that the Government has accepted the wide-ranging recommendations.Could the Ministry provide an update on this matter and the specifics on the key proposals which should be adopted and implemented?The Chairman: Mr Louis Ng. Both cuts, please.Specifying Essential Occupier in DivorceMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): Sir, last year I asked the Ministry to consider requiring divorce rulings to specify which parent can list their child as an essential occupier in HDB flat applications. The reply was that parents with shared care and control arrangements have equal rights to list their child as an essential occupier and they should come to a mutually agreeable decision themselves.That is ideal but the reality is that a divorcing couple might find it hard to cooperate on an issue as contentious as housing. Divorce rulings already decide on custody, care and control and division of matrimonial assets, which are equally contentious. Why not housing?Can MSF clarify what each parent awarded care and control is expected to provide in terms of housing for the child? Is a parent's ability to provide housing a factor in awarding care and control to that parent?For the welfare of the child, can MSF require divorce rulings that award shared care and control to also state which party is allowed to list the child as an essential occupier in their application to buy a subsidised HDB flat?Providing Single Unweds Full Baby BonusNext, the parent who needs the cash component of the Baby Bonus the most is the one who does not qualify for it. Why? With a median salary of only $600 a month, single unwed parents under 35 years old clearly need the cash.They can get the cash if they marry the father or mother of their child and then file for a divorce. But why do we want fellow citizens to marry someone they do not want to marry and jump through so many hoops to get something they should get?They already receive the CDA component of the Baby Bonus, so why not the cash component? Let us end the discrimination and provide single unwed parents with a cash component of the Baby Bonus.Making a Good Start in LifeMr Seah Kian Peng: Over the years, the Government has been providing generous pre-school subsidies to support working parents with young children in their care-giving duties. This has allowed many women to re-join the workforce after becoming mothers.Surveys have shown that 72% of mothers here take some form of break after childbirth. So, helping these women return to work is a significant and worthwhile effort.Many women already know of the platforms that are in place to help them, including subsidies from MOM as well as social enterprises who link them up with employment opportunities.These women may already have strong social networks. However, there is a gap for low-income mothers who do not have alternative care-giving arrangements. For those who do not work, they may not know of these platforms and opportunities. And this may, in turn, affect their ability to look for paid employment opportunities that are flexible enough to accommodate their need to care for their young children. This sets up a vicious cycle of missed opportunities and lack of mobility.Do we know how large this group is and what are the main obstacles to their re-joining the workforce? This is the group that needs more help from us. So, I would like to ask the Minister what other measures are in place to better support this group of low-income mothers who do not have alternative care-giving arrangements.The Chairman: Mr Ang Hin Kee. Both cuts, please.Mother Tongue Teachers in Pre-schoolsMr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio): Mr Chairman, I would like to speak in Mandarin for my first cut.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Because of COVID-19, some of our expatriate pre-school Chinese teachers must be quarantined and cannot return to Singapore to resume work. Their colleagues who continue working and their students all miss them. They are being told not to worry as the pre-school centres are working hard to ensure that students can attend lessons as usual. During this critical period, everyone is working together to overcome difficulties.I would like to know, currently, how many pre-school teachers specialise in teaching Chinese and, among them, and how many are foreigners? How many of these foreign teachers have been affected by the outbreak?Using this outbreak as a learning point, will MSF consider adjusting the ratio of foreign and the local pre-school teachers to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation where there is a sudden drop in teaching staff?I understand recruiting Singaporean pre-school Chinese teachers is a challenge. I would like to know how many pre-school Chinese teachers we need to meet future demands and whether we are close to achieving this target.I have met many Singaporeans who are passionate about the Chinese language and some of them are mid-career individuals. Does MSF have new plans to attract more Singaporeans and mid-career individuals to join the pre-school education sector?We must also provide schemes for upskilling, as well as education resources, to help Chinese language teachers gain new knowledge and deepen their teaching capabilities to help nurture students' interest in the Chinese language.In 2018, MSF announced a new Mother Tongue teaching certification programme jointly launched by ECDA and the National Institute of Early Childhood Development. The programme was launched last year with the aim of enhancing the oral skills of pre-school teachers and deepening their understanding of the relevant cultures and traditions. The programme will cater to Malay and Tamil teachers initially. May I know whether there are similar plans for the Chinese language teachers?Student Care Services(In English): Dual-income families are becoming the norm and, naturally, demand for more full-day pre-school and after-school student care services. It was announced in last year's Committee of Supply that all Primary schools would have after-school care facilities within the school compound by the end of 2020.As we ramp up capacity to meet demand, how do we ensure that fees across all school-based Student Care Centres (SCCs) are fair? Does the Ministry also track the pricing of fees by all registered centres and publish this information for comparison by parents?In a recent response from MSF to my Parliamentary Question, it was noted that close to half of parents' feedback concerning SCCs are related to issues, such as hygiene and child management. The rest relates to affordability, capacity and issues, such as enrolment process, to the requirements imposed on registered SCCs.Currently MSF only provides SCC operators guidelines in aspects, such as staffing, layout, programme, hygiene and safety, recommended educational qualifications and training for their supervisors and staff. All SCCs are also required to meet standards in the areas of supervision, physical environment, operating hours, safety, health and hygiene and provide a structured daily programme.Will the Ministry consider mirroring the approach taken in the pre-school sector?Childcare centres and kindergartens are licensed under the regulatory framework. This helps to enhance the affordability, accessibility and quality of our pre-schools. Consequently, there are also clear skills frameworks and mandatory training programmes to ensure that there is uniformity in how pre-school centres deliver their care and supervision programmes. I believe this can serve as a useful guide to the SCCs to provide a positive and developmentally appropriate physical environment for our students.With a better trained workforce and clearer career progression, it can also seek to improve the professional image of the student care sector and attract more Singaporeans to join the sector.Will the Ministry consider having funding support to assist the centres invest in staff training so that we can have a sound and reliable after-school care support system?The Chairman: Mr Darryl David, take your two cuts together.Early Childhood EducationMr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio): Mr Chairman, a research on neurology and developmental psychology found that the early years of a child's learning experience plays an important role in the child's future physical, cognitive, emotional and social development. Early childhood education, therefore, has a direct impact on the child's overall development, the type of adult that he/she will become and the society that a country will develop accordingly.In his research, Jack Shonkoff of the Harvard School of Public Health went as far as to suggest that early childhood education is the most important investment that a country can make because it forms the foundations for a prosperous and sustainable society. This is because a stable, responsive, rich and nurturing learning experience in the formative years of a child will have a lifelong impact on his/her mental and physical health, as well as the human capital potential.At the National Day Rally in 2019, Prime Minister Lee announced that the Government would be increasing Government-supported pre-school places to improve accessibility to affordable and quality pre-schools. Measures to be adopted include the extension of the Partner Operator (POP) Scheme, which will improve the affordability, accessibility and quality of POP services through Government funding and support.Beyond the Government's plans to expand the Anchor Operators (AOPs) and POPs in the early childhood sector, how else is the Government intending to support other pre-school operators, especially the smaller independent ones in this sector?Non-working MothersNext cut, please.The Government has made significant investments in recent years to enhance the quality and accessibility of early childhood education. In last year's National Day Rally, as I have mentioned earlier, Prime Minister highlighted the broad plans to \"more than double\" the current spending on early childhood education over the next few years.Part of this increase in spending is to raise the number of families that are eligible for additional means-tested subsidies by raising the household monthly income ceiling from $7,500 to $12,000, thereby helping an additional 30,000-odd families.However, there remains a care-giving gap. Under the current framework, a larger subsidy quantum is given to working mothers to support their child care-giving needs when they are at work. In contrast, a smaller subsidy quantum is given to non-working mothers with the understanding that they provide home-based care-giving to their children as an alternative to full-day childcare services. This has resulted in a somewhat unique situation sometimes where dual-income families could receive a higher level of pre-school subsidies than single-income families.Mr Chairman, I would like to state for the record that I am very grateful for all the hard work that my wife does as a full-time mum, a non-working mum, and I agree that non-working mothers could provide the home-based childcare giving that working mothers are unable to. I am very grateful for that.6.00 pmHowever, the reality is that not all working mothers are able to provide effective home-based care for various reasons such as having to meet the demands of caring for elderly family members, who are old or who have special-needs; or in fact, caring for their other children whom might have special needs as well.I would like to enquire what measures are in place or can be put in place to better support this group of non-working mothers?KidSTARTMs Rahayu Mahzam: As much as we would like to believe that every child has the potential to succeed and do well in life, in reality, the circumstances in which the child is in at the start of his or her life, could dictate this trajectory of the life journey. His or her future could be impacted even as early as when the child is in the mother's womb. The mother's nutrition during her pregnancy will have an effect on a child's health and development. As soon as the child is born. The child's well-being and development will be affected by stimulations the child receives.We have now identified the importance of early childhood education and how crucial the early years are in shaping his or her development. I have always been excited about KidSTART and the potential it brings to change the lives of many children from low-income families and those who have challenging backgrounds. This programme provides holistic and comprehensive support to these families and gives these children a fighting chance to seize the same opportunities as children from better-off families.My biggest concern with this programme is whether it can be scaled up faster. I am therefore heartened to hear the recent announcement on the expansion of KidSTART and the launch of growing together with KidSTART at the Early Childhood conference last year.Could MSF share more about this? Perhaps one way to scale the programme is to have more involvement from corporate and community partners who can help replicate the programme and support more families. Could this be something MSF could consider? Further, in this regard, could MSF provide any updates on the types of partnerships with corporate and community partners forged thus far and whether we could build on these partnerships?Social Capital–Sharing to MultiplyThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng): Mr Chairman, at one of our Clementi coffeeshops, on weekends you can find a very special group of uncles and aunties. Some stay in Clementi or nearby. Some come from all over Singapore to meet. Some from the Pioneer Generation, some from the Merdeka Generation. Each one a veteran artist with a lifetime of experience. Many nationally, even internationally acclaimed. A number have even won the Cultural Medallion. All these luminaries and legends – and you can find them at one of our Clementi coffeeshops on a weekend.Last year, as part of our National Day celebrations, these veteran artists helped organise an exhibition at our Clementi Community Centre. It was a very special gathering, but what made it extra special, even more special, was how our residents came together, across from all walks of life, with the artists for this community art exhibition. Exhibiting artworks together, even making impromptu artwork on the spot together. Young parents, youths, children from all walks of life, including families, starting with less, families living in our rental blocks in Clementi.I spoke with a young boy, who was deeply moved that his drawing was being exhibited alongside the work of these famous artists. It boosted his confidence. He had found new friends, new networks. The artists also shared, that by connecting with the community, including some of our children who were starting with less, they had also found ways to introduce their heritage, their life stories to another generation of young Singaporeans.Sir, it makes a difference in our communities when we give time, energy and heart. When people come together, creating moments, creating memories, creating opportunity. We see this too, in our tuition mentoring programmes in Clementi Town. Young professionals, as well as students still in higher education, young people working together, volunteering as homework mentors for children who are starting with less. Again, sharing time, energy and heart. And with each friendship forged, each moment shared, it lifts up each child even as it changes, touches, transforms the life of each volunteer.Mr Chairman, what these stories tell us, is that community partners can play a very special role in helping to lift up our children, in helping to lift up communities, in helping to lift up our fellow Singaporeans and especially children, who are starting with less. It tells us that how we multiply social capital is an important complement to the traditional fiscal measures that can found in any Budget. Because, Mr Chairman, in a fair and equitable society, fiscal redistribution is an important part of policy. Fiscal redistribution in a progressive way, giving more to people who start with less.But there are also many kinds of sharing, many kinds of sharing which go beyond dollars and cents which cannot easily be measured in terms of hard numbers, but these forms of sharing are also deeply important. The sharing of life experiences, the sharing of networks, the sharing of mentorship, the sharing of social capital.Sir, the magic of social capital is that sharing is not a zero-sum process. When we share social capital, it multiplies and it lifts up everyone even as we connect together, grow together, grow closer together as one Singapore family together, as Singapore together. And Sir, it is my belief that this element of social capital can and must be part of how we continue building and uplifting our communities and our societies because, whether in Singapore or around the world, much of the research on the role of neighbourhoods, on the role of communities, implicit in that, is the idea that in that in the role of places and neighbourhoods, there is also the role of social capital.Whether you are looking at the research by Raj Chetty and his colleagues in the US, whether you listen to the stories by researchers such as Angus Deaton, all these researchers who have looked at inequality in society, who look at the role of neighbourhoods and how people's lives change over time – my belief is that a key question in all this, is the role of social capital and we must continue looking at it closely, developing it, growing it further.Mr Chairman, to bring that social capital together in our society, it also helps to bring different stakeholders together to bring corporations and community partners together. And as we heard recently at the Early Childhood conference in September last year, the Minister for MSF announced the expansion of KidSTART and growing together with KidSTART.So, if I may ask the Minister, can MSF share any updates on the types of partnerships with corporates and community partners forged so far, because it takes all of us to make Singapore better and part of that journey to building a more fair and more equitable society is how we grow that social capital among us, how we grow the networks among us and how through that we uplift one another. Because, Mr Chairman, as we said earlier when we share social capital it multiplies. So, let us grow our society and multiply the good within us to touch others.The Chairman: Minister Desmond Lee.The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee): Mr Chairman, I thank Members for their thoughtful and heartfelt speeches.Over the last few years, we have been working with many community partners and stakeholders to transform our social sector, better enable Singaporeans to seize opportunities and uplift those who have encountered setbacks, at every stage of their lives. MSF will continue to push ahead with efforts to transform our social safety net in three significant ways.First, we will go upstream and intervene early, where possible. Intensive downstream measures or casework remains necessary to support those who have fallen behind. But I think we all agree that prevention is better than cure.Second, we will continue to put individuals and families at the centre of our work. Not agencies and organisations but people and families. The needs of families and individuals can be complex and inter-locking. They can seldom be addressed by a single organisation on its own. Yet, as we bring in more partners, we also need to make sure that it is simple and intuitive for families to access help and resources. So, we will continue to streamline structures and processes, tighten coordination across partners and organise services around families and individuals.Third, we will reach out and work with even more partners to transform our social safety net together and to address the challenges in the social sector that Deputy Prime Minister mentioned in his Budget Statement. In order to achieve greater impact, we have to reach out, build relationships, earn the trust of our partners, collaborate and draw on the diverse strengths of the people, private and public partnerships. To facilitate such partnerships, we will build capability, tap on technology to strengthen links between partners and grow organic local community networks.So, let me share some details about how we are pushing ahead in some of these areas. First, expanding our early intervention efforts, to give every child and every family a good start. The early years are critical for a child's development. Over the past decade, we have made significant progress in making quality preschools more accessible and affordable for Singaporean families.In January, we increased the preschool subsidies for low- and middle income families and enabled more families to benefit from the Additional Subsidy by raising the monthly household income ceiling from $7,500 to $12,000. We also support our Anchor and Partner operators to keep their fees below the caps set by ECDA and invest in improving the quality of their programmes.We will do more. To enable more families to access affordable and quality preschool, we will extend the Partner Operator scheme for another five-year term, starting from January 2021. We have 250 Partner Operators today. In the new term, we intend to appoint more. When we do so, we will further lower the fee caps, so families with children attending these centres can pay lower fees for quality preschool education.For low-income families, we provide upstream support to them and their children through KidSTART. Since 2016, KidSTART has benefited over 1,000 children. With the positive feedback, we will expand KidSTART to reach 5,000 more children and their families over the next three years.In conjunction with this, we launched the \"GROWING TOGETHER with KidSTART\" movement where individuals and organisations can contribute directly to the growth and development of children from lower income households. If you join us, you can partner families, the community and the Government to provide extra resources and support and watch these children grow up.We hope more of you will step forward and work with us to give our children the best possible start in life. This is again one of the social sector challenges that Deputy Prime Minister referred to in his Budget Statement – to grow a whole-of-society effort to better support children from lower income families.Our efforts to give every child a good foundation go beyond pre-school. Working parents may not have time to supervise their children after school. For some parents, student care services can fill this gap by providing a structured and conducive after-school environment. This augments the foundation built in school. Therefore, we will increase subsidies to make student care more affordable and accessible for lower income families.6.15 pmMy colleague, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, will share more details later.Sir, giving every child a good start also means protecting children who are vulnerable. Last September, Parliament amended the Children and Young Persons Act. The raising of the age limit for children and young persons from 16 to 18 years will enable more children to benefit from care, protection and rehabilitation, if needed.MSF has been working with community partners and agencies on implementation and capability building. We aim to bring the first set of amendments into effect in the second quarter of this year. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim will elaborate on this in his speech.I will now touch on what we are doing to go upstream, to strengthen and support families.A strong marriage is the foundation for a strong family. Marriage preparation programmes help couples build a strong foundation for their married life and pick up useful skills such as communication and conflict management.Mr Seah Kian Peng asked how we are making these programmes more accessible and affordable. To encourage more couples to take up such programmes, we have been providing generous rebates and will continue to do so.When couples start a family and become parents, they will face a new set of challenges. Evidence-based parenting programmes, such as the Positive Parenting Programme or Triple P, have helped parents to pick up skills to manage difficult behaviours exhibited by their children and to reduce their parenting stress.Ms Irene Quay asked for an update on Triple P, in front of her children. In 2014, we piloted Triple P in Primary and Secondary schools. After we saw how it helped parents, we expanded it to more schools. Today, Triple P is offered in 295 Primary and Secondary schools in Singapore, and over 20,000 parents have attended. An online option for Triple P, or Triple P Online, is also available for the convenience of parents.Last year, we decided to put in more structure to our upstream family support and anchor upstream support at the regional and community level. And so, we appointed 10 social service agencies as regional Parenting Support Providers or PSPs. Besides working with schools in their regions to deliver Triple P to more parents, these providers also serve as a one-stop shop offering a wider range of programmes. This allows PSPs to provide more customised support for each family.These moves incorporate feedback that we have received – that early support is important to help parents pick up skills for more effective parenting. As families get smaller, and increasingly both parents work, it can be challenging for families to strike a balance between work and family life. So, we will do more to give families early support in their parenting journey.Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked about the status of the recommendations made by the Committee to Review and Enhance Reforms in the Family Justice System. We have accepted the Committee's recommendations, which include more upstream pre-divorce support for couples. The feedback and our assessment have been uploaded on the Internet. They are quite detailed. The Member can find more details there.Over the course of marriage, there will be couples who face significantly more challenges. Some may consider divorce as an option. We will develop an online portal to support these couples.The portal will make it easier to access marriage counselling. We hope that this will help couples to make better decisions and to give their marriage another chance.But for those who decide to proceed with the divorce, the portal will consolidate information and resources on housing, finance and other important issues that will significantly impact the family's lives after divorce. This helps couples to better understand the practical implications of their decision and reduces the need for couples to approach multiple agencies for information.Children are often the most severely affected in a divorce. The portal will help couples understand the immediate as well as long-term impact on children, learn how to co-parent effectively and point them to relevant services, if needed.Currently, divorcing parents with minor children, who are unable to reach an agreement on divorce are required to attend the Mandatory Parenting Programme (MPP) where counsellors from the Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (DSSAs) help them better understand the practical issues of divorce.We will ride on the online portal to introduce an enhanced Mandatory Parenting Programme. This will help divorcing parties better understand their specific circumstances and needs through an e-learning module, and have a more personalised discussion with their counsellor. Both this enhanced programme and the online portal will be ready in the later part of next year.However, some couples are hesitant to use face-to-face counselling services or prefer online avenues. To overcome this, MSF will implement a two-year pilot with the Community Psychology Hub to provide online counselling through live chat or email later this year. This pilot can reach out to 200 clients a year. We hope that this online channel will encourage those who are hesitant about face-to-face services to seek help earlier. We will assess the demand and the response to this service, before making it available on the online portal itself.To ensure that the online portal is truly useful, relevant and sensitive, we will engage Singaporeans in focus group discussions in the third quarter of this year to seek honest feedback and develop various aspects of the portal such as design, content and flow.Mr Louis Ng asked whether MSF could require divorce rulings to specify which parent can list their child as an essential occupier when applying to buy an HDB BTO flat. I think the Member asked the same question yesterday during MND'sCOSand also got his answer.Sir, it is better for couples to work out arrangements between themselves. It involves their children and they will be co-parents for the lives of their children as they grow up. This is where the initiatives I just described – the portal, online counselling – could help them work out the best care arrangements for their children.Having said that, the Member is right that not all divorces are amicable. HDB is prepared to consider waiving the mutual agreement requirement if there is clear evidence that one party has already moved on. And the Courts ultimately have the power to make care and control orders and impose conditions. Parties may return to Court for detailed rulings, if necessary.Mr Louis Ng also asked about single unwed parents. We recognise the challenges faced by single parents. This is why benefits to support the growth and development of children are given to parents of all Singaporean children, regardless of their marital status. Besides the Child Development Account benefits, we have also extended 16 weeks of maternity leave to unwed mothers.Sir, I move on to the second key thrust of our transformation – putting individuals and families at the centre of our work.Last year, we announced that we would be integrating the oversight of early intervention services for children with special needs, with mainstream pre-school services, under one body – the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). ECDA will have a holistic view of the developmental needs of children below the age of seven. They will be able to coordinate early childhood development and early intervention as one integrated continuum.As a next step, we will further streamline the administration of disability functions. Through our conversations with the community, we recognise that it can be challenging for persons with disabilities (PWDs) and their care-givers to approach different agencies for different needs and different issues.To better support persons with disabilities and their care-givers, SG Enable will be the single touchpoint for disability services and public education efforts.Accordingly, disability service-related functions and programmes currently under MSF headquarters and the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) will be transferred to SG Enable. This will strengthen the delivery of services for PWDs and their care-givers across different life stages and needs. MSF's Disability Office will retain policy oversight over disability matters.We will continue to work closely with our stakeholders to see how we can better meet the needs of persons with disabilities. Last year, we formed three Enabling Masterplan workgroups to look at Employment and Employability, Independent Living and Inclusive Pre-schools. Minister of State Sam Tan will provide updates on these three cross-sectoral workgroups in his speech later.In our community engagements, we often hear the worries and concerns of care-givers of persons with disabilities. For students with special needs, care-givers tell us that special student care service is essential. Besides helping care-givers to balance work and care-giving responsibilities, the service also helps to reinforce what is taught in school.To better support persons with disabilities and their care-givers, we will make special student care service much more affordable. We will increase the subsidy quantum across all income tiers to reduce what parents have to pay out of pocket and raise the income cap so that more families can qualify. Minister of State Sam Tan will provide you the details later.Sir, we have also adopted this approach of providing wrap-around, client-centric support to families with young children living in rental housing. Assoc Prof Daniel Goh asked whether we track the financial health of families at the bottom income quintile as their expenses seem to be growing faster than their incomes. Lower income families also seem to be spending more on household and utilities. There are two reasons for these observations.First, some of these families are retiree households who tap on other sources of income, including savings, allowances from children, CPF payouts and so on. Second, in calculating household expenditure and utilities, rent is included, but mortgage repayment for owner-occupied property is not. Many 1- to 2-room HDB flats are public rental flats. That is why families living in these flats seem to be spending more on housing.In any event, for low-income families experiencing hardship, we provide financial assistance, along with the support from our community partners and agencies, to help them with daily expenses and household bills, including utilities, public rental fees and mobile data plans. We regularly review the assistance to account for changes in the prices of essential items as well as changing needs.Assoc Prof Walter Theseira and Mr Mohamed Irshad asked how we will assist families who face food insecurity. Our assistance to low-income families through ComCare covers basic needs such as food. For families facing immediate needs, our Social Service Offices (SSOs) offer interim assistance such as cash and supermarket vouchers. We also connect them to community-based support such as free cooked food. Families who are unable to buy or prepare their own meals are also linked up with food rations and meal delivery services offered by social service agencies.We recognise that low-income households may face challenges in eating healthily. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) works with donors to encourage them to donate healthier and more nutritious food products.The community, too, plays an important role in supporting vulnerable households with food provisions. MSF has been working with food support organisations and charities since 2018. Last year, we convened a workgroup with food organisations and charities, volunteer groups and Government agencies to look at how to reduce food waste and inefficiencies in distributing food, in order to ensure that beneficiaries receive healthy and nutritious food. We have made some progress and will continue to work on these issues together.But we want to go beyond providing financial assistance and addressing immediate needs.For families with young children, we want to proactively reach out to provide Comprehensive, Convenient and Coordinated support. We want to empower them to overcome their challenges, achieve sustained stability and possibly even purchase their own homes. And we want to bring the community together to do this.At last year'sCOS, I announced that MSF will be launching Community Link, or ComLink, at four locations – Jalan Kukoh, Marsiling, Kembangan-Chai Chee and Boon Lay. In each location, we wanted to bring partners together to address the community's needs in a proactive and customised manner. Mr Seah Kian Peng, Mr Darryl David and Dr Lily Neo asked how we work with different community agencies to support individuals and families in need in a more coordinated manner. Our approach is to work with these agencies as equal partners right from the get go.Over the past year, local implementation workgroups comprising social service agencies, schools and pre-schools, Government agencies, and the grassroots went door-to-door to engage all families with young children, and conducted focus group discussions to understand their needs, worries, strengths and aspirations. Backend, the workgroups held regular case discussions to link families to the right agencies for additional support, coordinate the interventions provided and track their progress closely.6.30 pmFor areas that existing programmes may not fully address, the workgroups roped in new partners to bring new programmes to the community. For example, we noticed that families in Boon Lay lacked conducive study spaces at home. Often, parents are also not able to guide their children academically. To address this, the local implementation workgroup created a home work café at the Residents' Network, with South West CDC contributing funding and NTU students volunteering as tutors.In Jalan Kukoh and Marsiling, we have dedicated ComLink centres to run these programmes. We also make full use of existing community resources. So, in Boon Lay and Kembangan-Chai Chee, where the centres are being set up, we maximise existing spaces like the Residents' Network and RCs to operate these community programmes.Not only Government and community partners are involved. Corporates and volunteers have stepped forward to offer their expertise and time. For instance, Etonhouse Community Fund donated more than 800 Boxes of Joy with brand-new toys and educational materials to families living in all four ComLink areas in December last year. Doctors and lawyers have stepped forward to provide free health screening and legal advice to residents. Students from Polytechnics and Universities run tuition and enrichment programmes for the children.ComLink is a good example of the type of cross-sectoral partnerships that can bear fruit when we come together to address specific needs in our local communities. ComLink is a microcosm of how our future social safety net will look like – proactive, upstream, integrated and with individuals and the families placed at the centre of what we do.Sir, during this time, we are also paying particular attention to those affected by the COVID-19 situation. MTI's assessment, as you heard during theirCOS, is that the economic impact of COVID-19 could be worse than SARS. The Government has introduced measures to help businesses with cash flow, help workers remain employed and provide additional support for specific sectors directly affected.For MSF, our priority is to support vulnerable families and individuals who are unable to meet their basic needs because they are unable to work or because the sector they are working in have taken a big hit.First, we provide financial assistance for persons under Quarantine Orders or Stay-Home Notices, if they are in financial need. We are also tapping on The Courage Fund which now stands at $3.6 million to provide additional support for lower income families who are affected by COVID-19. For social service agencies, ComChest will also be providing support to help them cope with additional expenses.Beyond the challenges it poses to our economy, COVID-19 is also a test of our social resilience. I am encouraged to see people stepping forward to help one another. Many have signed up to volunteer and donated generously to The Courage Fund. Last Sunday, volunteers in the Families for Life Council launched the \"Share-the-Care\" movement, which encourages families to look beyond themselves to show appreciation to our frontline and their families.All 1,000 Share-the-Care baskets have been adopted and I hope families continue to pay the care forward. In fact, I got a message from one of the families. Their son, who is in Secondary school, after playing the games with his parents, packed the basket with new things, went to one of the clinics, after it closed to give it to the doctor and said, \"This is for you and your family and children\". It moved the doctor to tears. So, let us continue to stay vigilant, take the necessary precautions, take care of our families and keep a look out for one another and give each other a pat on the back, especially our frontline workers.Ms Denise Phua asked how we are tackling social challenges together as a society. The third key thrust of our transformation is indeed about collaborating more intensively with different partners across all areas of our work. Earlier, I spoke about how we are involving the community through partnerships such as \"GROWING TOGETHER with KidSTART\" and ComLink. Members might also recall the PEERS network or the Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers network. Launched in July 2019, the PEERS network is a diverse group comprising Government agencies, charities, religious organisations and community groups.Mr Murali Pillai asked about how we assist those who have homes but are sleeping in public because of family problems. Sir, Government agencies join community partners in the PEERS network on their regular night walks to reach out to rough sleepers, befriend them and understand their circumstances. For those who are willing to receive help, we address their immediate needs, work on underlying issues, and support them towards eventual longer term housing.It was not easy initially. There were concerns among our newfound partners that Government agencies would forcibly move the rough sleepers off the streets. But as we continued to work with them, to look after the rough sleepers' well-being, our relationship strengthened. Because of this trust and understanding, we were collectively able to support more rough sleepers in finding longer term solutions than if each of us were to work alone. I would like to thank all our partners for your trust, your partnership and for coming together. We welcome more partners to join us on this initiative.Another area that we want to partner the community more rigorously is in enhancing youth mental well-being. The latest Singapore Mental Health Study noted that young people between 18 and 34 years of age had a higher prevalence of mental health conditions, compared to older people. Mental health issues are complex but prevention, early detection and intervention can go a long way to help.This is not a new area. We are keenly aware of the many issues and struggles faced by those with mental health issues. You have heard from my colleagues in MOE, MOH and MOM on the measures that they have taken and are taking. The community and practitioners on the ground have also done a lot of good work. By bringing a social lens to this issue, however, we can further synergise our efforts and increase our overall impact.A person's mental well-being affects their families neighbours, colleagues and friends. It is more than a medical issue faced by a person. We want to address the social determinants of health – and consider what kinds of holistic support a person needs to stay healthy. Hence, there is more that we can do together. Last month, we made an open call for persons interested in the topic of youth mental well-being to step forward, connect with us to contribute ideas, and work with us to turn some of these ideas into reality.This is yet another challenge that Deputy Prime Minister mentioned, that we are issuing to the social sector. We are very encouraged by the enthusiasm of all who have reached out to us. In total, as of this time, more than 700 individuals and organisations have responded and the number continues to grow. Many are young people who are concerned by this issue and want to do something about it. Some have struggled with mental health issues. Some are care-givers or therapists of persons with mental health issues.We will be establishing a Youth Mental Well-being Network. Everyone who stepped forward during the open call, will have an opportunity to be part of this network. We will get to know one another, identify areas to collaborate and work together to deliver programmes and interventions, to better support our youths. And this work is just beginning. In a way, how we intend to proceed is uncharted waters.But some early ideas have already emerged. For example, providing information and raising awareness about available resources so that people know where to go for help and to do so earlier. This is just one of the points raised in the conversations we have had thus far.I hope many Singaporeans will partner us to jointly develop solutions for a happier and healthier society. Our young people deserve the best start in life possible.Sir, the social service sector is a major partner in our endeavour to build a society of opportunities for all. Demand for social services will increase in both scale and complexity as our social challenges evolve. We therefore need social service professionals with deep skills and capabilities.In April last year, we set up the Social Service SkillsFuture Tripartite Taskforce to bring together academics, professional associations, Social Service Agencies and policy-makers to look at how we can enhance the capabilities and effectiveness of the professionals in the sector. Since then, the taskforce has initiated various manpower development projects, which we will share more on in the coming months.Besides skilled and competent professionals, we also need social service agencies with the capability and capacity to deliver outcomes sustainably, effectively and efficiently. Donors generally prefer to support programmes and services that directly benefit service users and those in need – understandably so.However, resources are needed to build capability and capacity in our social service agencies. As announced by Deputy Prime Minister during Budget, we will introduce the Community Capability Trust (CCT). This is a dedicated, long-term fund of up to $480 million to strengthen our social service agencies capability and capacity to do more and to do so better.This fund will be made up of contributions from the Government, Tote Board and the community. Government and Tote Board will provide an initial $200 million in capital. To encourage donors to contribute to capability building, the Government and Tote Board will match $2 to every dollar donated by the community for five years, from FY2020 to FY2024. Thereafter, donations from FY2025 to FY2029 will be matched dollar-for-dollar.The Community Chest will also provide an additional $30 million in capital and spearhead fundraising initiatives to unlock the matching grants. So, let us grow this fund together and use it to prepare our sector for the challenges of the future.Capability and capacity building may sound very abstract, so, let me illustrate how our efforts to build up our social service agencies capabilities can have a real and lasting impact on the people that we serve.There are many examples, but we have chosen a very \"techie\" one where the benefit is very clear.Angsana Home is a Welfare Home managed by Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society in Pelangi Village. Under the Tech Booster project by the National Council of Social Service, it has implemented the SoundEye monitoring system. The system makes use of smart sensors with AI-enabled sound recognition and motion detection technology to identify abnormal sounds or movements that could give early warning of distress from residents.Angsana Home staff can be more quickly alerted when residents require attention or help, even during night shifts when there may be fewer staff are on duty. This allows the Home to monitor residents' safety more effectively and provide better care to residents. This is an example of the kind of work that the CCT will support, enabling the social service agencies to do their work better, serve beneficiaries more effectively, have better outcomes and make the work better for social sector professionals.We know that building capability and capacity is a long-term effort that requires sustained investment. The CCT will give the sector the time and resources needed to build stronger and more productive social service agencies that are ready for tomorrow's challenges.To serve clients in a coordinated manner, we also need to strengthen the links across social service agencies, as well as between them and Government agencies. Earlier, I spoke about how we work with community agencies as equal partners so that we can operate in concert. Besides working collaboratively, technology is also a key enabler to help us coordinate better. Today, we harness technology to enable our clients to access services more conveniently. Besides financial assistance, all SSOs offer access to employment and housing services. Some also offer access to family and legal advisory services.Most of these services are provided at the SSOs through video conferencing to other agencies, making it more convenient for clients who need not make multiple trips to receive support from agencies such as HDB, Workforce Singapore (WSG) and the Legal Aid Bureau. We will grow this video conferencing network by offering access to more of these services at all our SSOs, and by bringing partners such as Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and hospitals into the network, over the next year.6.45 pmBesides using video conferencing, we want to harness technology to provide more comprehensive and coordinated support to clients and beneficiaries.Today, officers may ask clients to submit documents, so that they can better understand their circumstances. This may sometimes include documents that clients had already submitted to other agencies previously. And when one agency needs to make referrals to another, officers often do so over emails for each and every case. After the referral is made, officers may also need to check in with their counterparts to keep track of progress.To streamline these efforts, we will make significant system enhancements.First, the enhanced system will allow frontline officers to make faster and more comprehensive assessments about their clients' needs, through digitalisation and data sharing across multiple agencies. Clients will also experience greater convenience without having to repeatedly submit documents to multiple organisations.Second, the enhanced system will make it easier for agencies to refer cases, share assessments, coordinate how they are supporting their clients and monitor the clients' progress.This way, all parties can monitor progress and coordinate follow-up actions better, to improve a client's situation. This will also reduce the bandwidth tax on families as they seek to tackle the challenges they face.These enhancements will be rolled out from the second half of this year. We will bring agencies on-board this system progressively. In steady state, about 5,000 frontline officers from both Government and community agencies will be able to tap on the enhanced system to provide comprehensive, convenient and coordinated support to the Singaporeans that we serve.Technology is important, but it is no substitute for the human touch. This person-to-person connection is critical in the social service sector, because it builds trust and understanding. With mutual trust, we are comfortable calling our counterparts in another organisation and mobilising support on multiple fronts to address issues quickly.To strengthen these personal connections, we organise SG Cares Community Network sessions every year in each and every town, all across the island, to bring together partners from the social, health and community sectors in each town. Through this platform, partners get to affirm and build new relationships. We also invite partners to exchange ideas and best practices on addressing needs in the community. The sessions spark discussions that turn into collaborative projects.We completed the first wave of 19 SG Cares Community Network sessions island-wide in 2019. Through these sessions, we brought together more than 3,500 participants from 160 Government and community help agencies.The Community Network sessions from the first wave catalysed 60 collaborative projects. \"Stories About Us\", started by community partners in Hougang and Serangoon, is one such project. These community partners saw the need to listen to the voice of those with mental health issues when designing solutions for them. They then engaged recovering mental health patients to understand the challenges they face in navigating social and healthcare services and asked them how agencies can better support them.In the second wave, which we have started in November last year, our SSOs will jointly organise these sessions with community partners and volunteers, and develop and implement their ideas together with them. Mr Chairman, allow me now to speak briefly in Mandarin.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]Chairman, in the past few years, MSF has been collaborating with the community to strengthen our social safety net, in line with the SG Together movement.Moving forward, youth mental well-being is another important area in which we will continue with this partnership approach.Studies have shown that young people between 18 and 34 years of age have a higher prevalence of mental health conditions as compared to older groups.Last month, I made an open call for Singaporeans interested in the topic of youth mental well-being to step forward with their ideas. In total, more than 700 individuals and organisations have responded, many of whom are young people who are concerned about this issue and want to do something about it.We will set up a youth mental well-being network and invite those who are passionate about this topic to share their views. We will identify areas to collaborate and work together to develop more holistic support for our youth's mental well-being.Through such partnerships, we can synergise and amplify our efforts to better support Singaporeans in need.I hope more Singaporeans will step forward and partner us to build a caring and inclusive society together.(In English): Chairman, we are committed to nurturing resilient individuals, strong families and a caring society. We are intervening early to give every child and every family a good start. We are continuing to put those we serve, at the centre of what we do. We are partnering the community, building sector capability and strengthening networks to work better together.Our society is stronger and more resilient when all Singaporeans come together, when we look out not only for ourselves, but our families, neighbours and fellow Singaporeans in need.As Deputy Prime Minister mentioned in the Budget Statement, the Government has identified specific challenges that we are bringing partners across the public, people and private sectors together to address. I also spoke about several initiatives that we will work together with Singaporeans on. These include GROWING TOGETHER with KidSTART to support low income families with young children; an online portal for those facing difficulties in their marriage; ComLink to uplift families living in rental housing; the PEERS network to assist rough sleepers; the Community Capability Trust to build capability and capacity in the sector; and the Youth Mental Well-being Network.I hope more Singaporeans will step forward to join us in these initiatives, participate in our Community Network sessions or join a Volunteer Centre set up by MCCY in their town.Let us work together to make Singapore a place where those in need are better supported and where Singaporeans have the chance to pursue their dreams, regardless of their starting points and what they may have encountered as they progress in life. [Applause.]The Chairman: Minister of State Sam Tan.The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong): Mr Chairman, we are building a more caring and inclusive Singapore. One where individuals are valued for who they are and also enabled to achieve their potential.The Enabling Masterplans aim to support persons with disabilities (PWDs), recognise their abilities and help them to participate meaningfully in our community and also in our society.As part of the Masterplans, we set up SG Enable in 2013 to better support them. Since then, SG Enable has become a trusted partner to PWDs, their care-givers and Social Service Agencies (SSAs).Minister Desmond Lee spoke about placing citizens at the centre of our work and also the consolidation of disability support services under SG Enable in his speech earlier. Please allow me to explain further.Over the past three years, we have spoken to PWDs, care-givers, social service operators and many stakeholders, to understand the challenges and needs that they face.From their feedback, one common challenge is the need to work with different agencies and SSAs at different life-stages to get help, and sometimes having to submit the same documents multiple times. To them, having a single touchpoint to support them at all life-stages would make life easier. Many SSAs in the disability sector also told us that the sector could be better coordinated. For example, they have to work with different agencies to get approval and funding for different programmes and activities.We are grateful to our partners and stakeholders, and have been making efforts to streamline service delivery for the disability sector based on their feedback.So, I am pleased to announce that from 1 October 2020, SG Enable will become the single touchpoint for the disability sector. It will take over the administration of disability programmes currently run by MSF and the National Council of Social Service (NCSS). In addition, people who are willing to serve and contribute towards creating an inclusive society will be able to identify SG Enable as the single touchpoint to volunteer their time and services.Ms Denise Phua and Ms Cheryl Chan made an important point on promoting inclusion and also correcting misperceptions about PWDs. This begins with building positive attitudes and improving understanding through public education.To make our public education messages stronger and clearer, SG Enable will lead public education efforts related to disability. This includes reaching out to the broader community through the \"See the True Me\" campaign and also coming up with resources on how people should interact with PWDs, and how they can be supported at the workplaces.Bringing different functions under one roof will improve efficiency, oversight and coordination of services. In addition, it will also provide clear direction for the many helping hands involved.This new single-touchpoint structure is the next big step forward for the sector to bring stakeholders under one umbrella to co-create and co-deliver services and solutions for PWDs.Sir, last year, we formed three cross-sectoral Enabling Masterplan workgroups on Employment, Independent Living and Inclusive Pre-schools.The workgroups have worked with Government and community partners over 13 engagement sessions. We consulted more than 200 PWDs, care-givers and over 40 different SSAs from the disability sector.With their input and suggestions, we are now working across the whole-of-Government, together with private and community partners, to co-create and co-deliver solutions to address the problems identified and raised during the 13 engagement sessions.Ms Denise Phua and Ms Sylvia Lim asked about what we are doing to help PWDs in terms of training and employment. As announced earlier by MOM, the Government has introduced new initiatives ,such as the Enabling Employment Credit and the enhancements to the Open Door Programme.That said, we are also aware that Government measures alone are not enough to meet all the needs. We need to bring the public, private and people sectors together to advance inclusive employment. A good example of how we do this is through the partnership between SG Enable and SSAs to provide training and job support services and their partnership with inclusive employers, such as UOB, to run initiatives such as \"The Unlimited\", which helps them reach out to even more employers who are willing to employ PWDs. But of course, there is always more that we can do together.So, under the employment workgroup, which I co-chair with Ms Denise Phua, we put ourselves in the shoes of PWDs looking for a job and we tried to understand the challenges that they face and also we have tried our best to identify the areas where they need more help. Through this exercise, we have identified four key areas where we can and we will do more to help them.Let me use an example to elaborate this further.Take for example, Mark, who is about to graduate from a SPED school and will be looking for a job. First, to enhance Mark's work capability, we will help him to improve in areas that employers have identified as crucial. These areas include soft skills, such as communication, teamwork and problem-solving skills. Second, we will create alternative supported employment models and job opportunities for Mark, as he may not be ready to work in an open employment environment yet. Third, we will enhance employment services to match and place Mark in a job. Fourth, we will enable Mark's colleagues to better understand and support him on the job, and we will strengthen education and awareness on working with persons with disabilities.There are initiatives planned for each of these areas. One such initiative is the development of a soft skills curriculum for students with disabilities, which MOE is working with employers and SSAs on.7.00 pmMs Denise Phua and other care-givers also raised concerns about a gap in terms of continual education and training. The workgroup is working with relevant people and also private sector partners to address this concern.All these efforts to support persons with disabilities in terms of training, work and employment are in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), something that was mentioned by Ms Sylvia Lim earlier.Besides employment, independent living is another issue raised by persons with disabilities and their care-givers. The workgroup on independent living, which I co-chair with Ms Chia Yong Yong, is looking into how we can help persons with disabilities live more independently in the community. While we recognise that there is a broad spectrum of disability types, allow me just to illustrate with the example of Amanda, who is visually impaired.By stepping into her shoes, we better understand the challenges that she faces along the way to access public transportation and what can enable her to overcome that. First, Amanda needs to cross the road from her house to the train station. She can activate the Green Man Plus at the pedestrian crossing. Not only does this function give her additional time to cross the road safely, the beeping sound also helps to orientate her in the right direction. At the train station, Amanda needs to find her way to the gantry. Here, she relies on the tactile flooring to guide her to the gantry, but she needs to take out and tap her EZ-Link card. By using radio frequency identification or Bluetooth technology that LTA is testing, she can, in the future, pass through the gantry hands-free, without any difficulty.At this point, let me also extend my appreciation to Mr Cheong Kwek Bin and the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped (SAVH). Working with visually impaired persons like Kwek Bin as a member of our workgroup has been immensely helpful. He and SAVH members have provided invaluable insights on how things can be improved.Collaborating with them has enabled us to gain insights, to use smart design and assistive technology to further help persons with disabilities to get around the built environment and also public transport.Another example of such a collaboration was the Mobility Assistance for the Visually Impaired and Special Users (MAVIS) pilot project, earlier shared by MOT.Sir, we also aim to increase public awareness and understanding on how to lend a helping hand to persons with disabilities if they need assistance, and also ensure that they have better access to information and online services.Many of these improvements will not only benefit persons with disabilities, but also all of us.The third Workgroup on inclusive preschools, which Senior Parliamentary Secretary Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and Assoc Prof Kenneth Poon co-chair, is studying models for inclusive preschools that will allow children with severe developmental needs to receive Early Intervention and Early Childhood services. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim will elaborate more on this later.All the three workgroups have taken in findings from the engagement sessions and will put up their recommendations later this year.Chairman, we are also doing more to provide support for care-givers of persons with disabilities. Mr Seah Kian Peng noted that Special Student Care Centres (SSCCs) are key to supporting care-givers. They are particularly essential for care-givers who need to work or care for other dependents and themselves.I am therefore happy to announce that MSF will improve funding and subsidy support for families of SSCC students and extend the subsidies to more families of Special Education (SPED) students. From 1 July 2020, we will raise the eligibility criteria for means-tested subsidies from $4,000 to $9,200, and we will also lower out-of-pocket expenses for SSCC services. This reduces the out-of-pocketcost for a child from a family with a combined household income of $4,000 by around 75%, or from currently $582 to $142 a month, starting from July.However, beyond the reduction in fees, these enhancements also provide much needed support and respite for care-givers like Mdm Valerie, who fell ill and could not take care of her daughter, Kylie. Before joining MINDS SSCC, Kylie had to be placed in institutional care. The SSCC helped Kylie learn to be more independent in her daily living skills and also facilitated her return home to her family when her mother recovered.Ms Rahayu Mazam asked how we could make it more convenient for persons with disabilities and their care-givers to access the support they require. Besides making services more affordable, we are also making information more accessible.To this end, SG Enable launched a new online website called \"The Enabling Guide\" in July last year. As a one-stop resource for persons with disabilities and care-givers to find help easily, it pulls together information and resources on various disability schemes and services, and guides users to make informed decisions about service options across the life stages. Sector professionals from the disability sector can also use information in the Enabling Guide to help their clients.Ms Denise Phua and Miss Cheryl Chan also asked important questions about the support available for persons with disabilities as care-givers age, and how we can help care-givers prepare for a future where the care-givers themselves are no longer able or around to take care of their children.Care-givers of persons who lack mental capacity can make financial arrangements such as setting up trust accounts with the Special Needs Trust Company. They can also apply to Court to be appointed as their child's deputies and have a successor deputy appointed to take their place when the need arises. MSF has also introduced the Assisted Deputyship Application Programme (ADAP) to make the deputyship application process simpler and cheaper.Sir, we want to assure care-givers that there is a continuum of support and residential facilities, and programmes for persons with disabilities.Those who can live independently can tap on Government funds for Assistive Technology devices to make their lives easier. Others who require some care-giving support can consider residential options in the form of Government-funded Community Group Homes and Adult Disability Hostels.But we also know that there are some who need greater care-giving support. When their care-givers pass away and if no one can take over the care-giving responsibilities, the Government will step in to take care of them in Government-funded Adult Disability Homes as the last resort. Sir, we will not leave them alone to fend for themselves. We will not.In line with the suggestion by Ms Denise Phua, we will continue to work with other relevant agencies to develop the continuum of housing options for persons with disabilities, as well as to make other community services more inclusive. Chairman, I would like to speak in Mandarin now.(In Mandarin):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.] Mr Chairman, we are committed to building an inclusive society where everyone can play their part, participate actively and contribute.From 1 July 2020, MSF will enhance subsidies to make Special Student Care Centres (SSCCs) services more affordable for families of Special Education (SPED) school students and will extend the subsidies to more families.We will raise the eligibility criteria for means-tested subsidies from $4,000 to $9,200, and lower out-of-pocket expenses for SSCC services. The reductions will range between 30% and 80% for most families. This means that out-of-pocketcost for a child from a family with a combined household income of $4,000 will be reduced by around 75%, from $582 to $142 a month.Let me also share that from 1 October 2020, SG Enable will be the single touchpoint for disability services, and take over the funding administration and management of disability programmes currently administered by MSF and the National Council of Social Service (NCSS). SG Enable will also take the lead on public education efforts related to disability and will take over the running of the See the True Me campaign from NCSS.The changes will allow SG Enable to enhance their efficiency in coordinating resources and project planning, and reduce duplications, so that they can provide more efficient and effective services for persons with disabilities and their care-givers.In July 2019, SG Enable also launched a new online website – the Enabling Guide. This is a one-stop online platform for persons with disabilities and care-givers to find help more easily. It pulls together information and resources on various disability schemes and services, and users can make more informed decisions about different service options across life stages. Sector professionals and social service agencies can also use the information in the Enabling Guide to better help their clients.MSF will continue to work with our people, private and public sector partners to build a more inclusive society. Under the third Enabling Masterplan, the Government has formed three cross-sectoral Workgroups to look into how we can better support persons with disabilities through their different life stages. This includes providing better support for children with developmental needs through an inclusive pre-school model, improving the employability of persons with disabilities and helping them live independently through the use of technology and design. The Workgroups will release their recommendations later this year.(In English): Mr Chairman, in closing, everyone has a part to play in building a caring and inclusive society. Inclusion is not just a vision. It is action. It is about people coming together, enabling each other to create a Singapore where every individual can achieve his or her potential.We want to build a Singapore that we are all proud to call home. So, at this moment, I would like to turn over the floor to Senior Parliamentary Secretary Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, to speak about other MSF programmes and services.The Chairman: Order."

        "Section Name": "Ministerial Statements",
        "MPs Speaking": "[Mr Deputy Speaker, Mr Deputy Speaker, Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan), Mr S Iswaran, Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling, Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh), Mr Deputy Speaker, Mr Deputy Speaker, Mr Saktiandi Supaat, The Minister for Communications and Information and Information and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations (Mr S Iswaran)]",
        "Content": "Debate resumed.Mr Deputy Speaker: Minister Iswaran.6.49 pmThe Minister for Communications and Information and Information (Mr S Iswaran): Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In the course of today's debate, several Members have spoken on the work of my Ministry, and our strategies to build a digital economy, and a digitally inclusive society which is also a key thrust in Deputy Prime Minister's Fortitude Budget.I would like to thank Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Ms Sylvia Lim, Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Douglas Foo, Mr Patrick Tay, Mr Melvin Yong, Mdm Lee Bee Wah, Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Muhd Faisal Manap and Ms Tin Pei Ling for their thoughtful comments and valuable ideas on this important national effort.COVID-19 poses an unprecedented challenge – to our health, our society and our economy. It has turned the world upside down, and we have seen competing narratives on how different societies, cultures and political systems have dealt, for better or worse, with the challenges posed by the virus.Now, as we emerge from the various measures to curb the spread of the virus, we will have to face the stark reality of its economic impact. So far, we been somewhat cushioned by the major fiscal measures announced by the Government – amounting to nearly $100 billion and 20% of our GDP. As Deputy Prime Minister Heng has said in his Budget speech, the Government has the responsibility to make the best use of our resources, to keep people safe, save jobs, transform businesses and, most of all, emerge stronger.But let us be clear. The global economic outlook is bleak and Singapore will not be spared. Based on the latest data, MTI expects our economy to contract by 4% to 7% this year, and there remain significant downside risks. We have tough challenges ahead. But they are not insurmountable. And we are taking decisive steps to deal with them.In this uncertain environment, the overriding economic imperative is to create opportunities and jobs for our people. That is the concern of Singaporeans. That is the focus of the Fortitude Budget. And that is the mission of the National Jobs Council established by Deputy Prime Minister Heng and chaired by Senior Minister Tharman.We are doubling down in our effort to identify jobs across the economy – be they permanent jobs, temporary jobs, part-time jobs, or traineeships. We will spare no effort to prepare and place our people in these roles – be they fresh graduates, from Universities, Polytechnics and ITEs, or mature workers in our economy. And, we will work closely with the Labour Movement and employers in this difficult but critical effort.One sector that holds promise is ICT, because COVID-19 has brought home the importance of digitalisation to our economy and digital inclusion to our society. Whether for individuals or families, businesses or industries, it is patently clear that digitalisation is no longer an optional extra. It is a critical necessity, if we are to survive this crisis and emerge stronger in a post COVID world.We will therefore seize this moment to make a decisive push towards a digital future, with three key thrusts: digital opportunities for workers; digital inclusion for all; and a concerted push for a digital future.In this year'sCOSdebate, I noted that the promise of digitalisation is tempered by the uncertainty of change. Change and disruption have descended upon us now in dramatic fashion in the guise of COVID-19. The silver lining is that this crisis has crystallised the need and opportunity for digitalisation.Consequently, the ICT sector remains one of the bright spots in our economy amidst the economic uncertainty. Digital and tech roles are in demand, within the ICT sector, but also across the rest of the economy as all sectors seek digital solutions. In the first quarter of this year, the ICT sector expanded by 3.5% with 1,100 new jobs.But we have to keep it real. Even in the ICT sector, jobs will be harder to come by now compared to pre-COVID times. In the current economic climate, ICT enterprises, like others, will be more restrained in their hiring decisions.That is why we are stepping up our partnership with the private sector. The TechSkills Accelerator initiative or TeSA will be enhanced in two important ways to help Singaporeans seize job opportunities in the ICT sector.First, we will scale up the Company-Led Training programme. In other words, we will partner leading tech and non-tech companies to place and train 3,000 Singaporeans in good tech jobs over the next two to three years – in functions like digital marketing, software engineering, cybersecurity and data analytics.Secondly, the TeSA Mid-Career Advance programme will run in parallel and create an additional 2,500 place and train opportunities for mid-career professionals aged 40 and above.Our goal is to help fresh graduates and mid-career professionals alike to secure these jobs, advance their skills and start a fulfilling career in one of the more promising sectors in our economy today.We adopt a similar broad-based approach to help enterprises at different stages in their digital journey. The SMEs Go Digital programme has Start Digital for new SMEs and Grow Digital for those expanding overseas using e-commerce platforms.We are augmenting this with sector-level digital solutions for F&B and Retail – two sectors that have many enterprises, that collectively employ many workers, and that have been significantly affected by COVID-19. We will introduce the Digital Resilience Bonus to encourage these businesses to adopt digital solutions like online ordering, e-invoicing, inventory management and e-payments to operate in the post COVID new normal.IMDA will give more details but let me use the example of Foreword Coffee Roasters, which serves specialty coffee and hires workers with special needs, to illustrate how this will help our F&B businesses.Foreword Coffee uses the baseline PayNow Corporate and PEPPOL e-invoicing accounts for transactions. The company also adopted a solution to create its online shopfront. Its new website was launched at the start of the circuit breaker and orders increased tenfold within one month. This digital initiative will allow them to receive a payout of $2,500 under the Digital Resilience Bonus.To advance its digitalisation journey, Foreword Coffee’s owner Mr Lim Wei Jie adopted a digital ordering solution and he also plans to deploy HR, payroll and accounting solutions in the coming months. That will entitle the company to an additional $2,500 under the Digital Resilience Bonus Scheme.Businesses that already have basic digital capabilities will receive an additional $5,000 should they decide to adopt advanced digital solutions like data mining and data analytics.I would like to assure Ms Tin Pei Ling in particular that we will be extending the Digital Resilience Bonus to F&B and retail enterprises in the first instance, but based on our experience, we will then ssess how we can expand this to other sectors subsequently and this is a discussion that we will continue to have with MOF.But let me now move to digital inclusion. Digitalisation is not an end in itself; it is a means to better lives and livelihoods. That is why digital inclusion has always been at the heart of the Government’s digitalisation effort. Our digital push must reach all segments of our economy and society, like our hawkers and senior citizens, so that they too can benefit and participate.Hawkers Go Digital will boost e-payment adoption among stallholders from hawker centres, wet markets, coffee shops and industrial canteens. Apart from the obvious public health benefits, this initiative is also a good launch point for stallholders’ digital transformation journeys.In this multi-agency effort by IMDA, Enterprise Singapore, NEA, JTC and HDB, we will reach out to and help over 18,000 stallholders adopt e-payment solutions by the middle of next year. Hawkers who sign up for the unified e-payment solution and fulfil the minimum transaction requirements will receive a bonus of up to $300 per month over five months.Among our seniors, it is gratifying to note that digital adoption has been increasing, with smartphone usage more than doubling over the past five years. But we can and want to do more. Digital literacy will enable our seniors to lead more engaged, informed and fulfilling lives. For seniors who are employed, digital skills will enhance their skills and productivity.We will therefore strengthen digital literacy and access among our seniors with the Seniors Go Digital Programme. The programme will help all our seniors build digital capabilities through virtual classes, one-on-one coaching at community places, once the Circuit Breaker measures allow for them, and that includes in libraries and community centres, small group learning with their friends and other hands-on learning opportunities.IMDA is also working with our telcosto offer better mobile data plans for our seniors. We will also provide financial assistance to seniors who cannot afford devices and data plans. These were important points raised by several Members.I understand the point made by Ms Sylvia Lim about keeping lowcost non-digital options open for seniors and others who might need it. Indeed, that is the experience we have had and the effort we have made. For example, in the SafeEntry app, you can use your phone but you can also use the physical Identity Card (IC). In general, the idea is to encourage the adoption of digital solutions but to keep open the option of using non-digital solutions because we know that there will be some who still prefer them or are uncomfortable with the digital part. The same applies for cybersecurity; it is something that we will continue to emphasise in our training programmes with seniors and how we can instil greater cybersecurity awareness amongst them.These new initiatives will complement our current digital inclusion programmes such as NEU PC Plus and Home Access to ensure digital access and connectivity for low-income households, including those with school-going children, and persons with disabilities. We have and will continue to enhance these programmes to meet the changing needs arising from COVID-19 and the Circuit Breaker measures.Digitalisation and digital inclusion are the twin engines that will take us to our digital future. COVID-19 has catalysed a heightened interest and need among individuals, families, workers and enterprises to be equipped with digital access and to acquire the requisite skills.  It has given us the impetus to invest in a decisive, all-out push towards a digital future.A few days back, I announced the formation of the SG Digital Office, under IMDA, to drive a national movement for digital transformation in our economy and our communities. We will mobilise 1,000 Digital Ambassadors for this effort, to reach 18,000 hawkers and 100,000 seniors, so that they can all Go Digital. This effort will mark a quantum shift in our digitalisation effort in the community and greatly benefit the lives and livelihoods of our people.Mr Deputy Speaker, I have outlined in some detail our initiatives to create jobs and opportunities in this challenging economic environment, and to make a decisive push towards digitalisation in our economy and digital inclusion in our society. The SG Digital Office, our Digital Ambassadors who will be embedded in the community, TeSA, the Digital Resilience Bonus, the Hawkers-go-Digital and Seniors-go-Digital programmes – all of these and many others are a measure of the scale and scope of our ambition for this national digitalisation movement and the resources we are committing to it.However, to succeed in this effort, we need the \"X\" factor. And that \"X\" factor is our people, our mindset, and our willingness to learn and adapt to the \"new normal\", as some have described it. It means workers who are prepared to pick up new skills and adjust to new jobs and circumstances, no matter what their background; it means seniors showing us the way that age is not a barrier to learning and making the digital transition; and it means hawkers who have the gumption to \"try lah\", as one hawker representative vividly put it to me, because of the conviction that this is a good thing.I know that some will be anxious about these changes and what it means for them. To them I say, on behalf of the Government, we will leave no one behind and will walk this digital journey with you. So, let us come together, seize this opportunity fully and secure a bright digital future for each and every Singaporean.Mr Deputy Speaker: Miss Cheryl Chan.7.05 pmMiss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan): Mr Deputy Speaker, today, there is still much uncertainty around COVID-19. Will there be a second wave locally or globally? What would the transmission rate be like after circuit breaker? How long would the downturn last? There are many questions that will still be left unanswered even if the entire nation is COVID-19 tested, assuming no mutation of the virus or until an effective vaccine against COVID-19 is found.However, what is certain at this point is we cannot afford to be in a standstill indefinitely. Reduced global trade has taken a toll on the global economy and businesses are struggling to stay afloat and retain their workers. The current situation is not just about economy, it greatly impacts lives. The central question is: how will we as a country recover from this pandemic and ensure we learn to put continuity in place if we ever face the next crisis.Budget 2020 is an unprecedented one in history both in magnitude and the support coverage across all segments in Singapore. In the Fortitude Budget, a further $33 billion is set aside to ensure livelihoods are broadly sustained and it seeks to provide a lifeline for businesses to resume in small steps. For many SMEs, sectors affected due to the nature of their trade and companies impacted by global restrictions, these grants are certainly welcome but they are still insufficient. At the same time, we also hear calls from concerned citizens to exercise prudence as they are worried the country’s reserves may be depleted before a full recovery is in sight.Personally, I am heartened that the Government has listened and continue to make adjustments to bridge and support the gaps in society through all subsequent Budgets from February. Having done these in a quick and calibrated manner, reaching out to the public, social sectors and the business groups, putting in place step measures as we continue our fight against COVID-19.I associate this to Our Singapore Conversation, which was first initiated in 2012. However, this time it had taken place in a much condensed timeframe of about four months. Are we done with the conversation? I do not think so.While many measures spelt out in the Budget serve its primary intent of rescuing situations in a downturn, I think it is pertinent for us to look at how to approach such resolutions through a whole-of-society involvement.Let me highlight a few areas to explain why it is inadequate for the Government or agencies alone to navigate these challenges.First, the trade classification on resumption of business after circuit breaker.It is understandable why the need for us to re-open in three phases but the rationale of why one trade is allowed to open in Phase One while another quite similar in nature is not allowed to do so had raised brows on how MTI decided the trade classification for business resumption.Take an example – after 2 June, the pet owners can bring their pets for grooming services but certain vet services are not allowed like the routine elective preventive care services or vaccines for their pets. It is not surprising some of these pet owners who are puzzled as to which is more important – the health condition or the looks of their pets.And while some companies are allowed to open in Phase One, their suppliers are placed in a different phase for re-opening or their sub-contractors could not receive approval to resume operations from Government agencies. An example of this is the construction, landscaping and renovation sector, in which many of our SMEs are affected. It is typical in these sectors for a single project to be fulfilled by a pool of suppliers and workers of varying skillsets from different companies. Main contractors outsource some parts of the project, have workers from different companies, staying in different dormitories to provide service at the same work site. This scenario, though typical in the past, have now become an insurmountable management task due to the new measures in place. Even if the companies understand and wish to comply with the new rules, some of the rules are impractical, or they would reduce productivity owing to its long roll-out period and further exacerbated by the inconsistency of the new measures that is detailed across the agencies.Citing one of the new measures on mandating workers to be sent for swab test every fortnight before they are allowed on the work site,cost being one concern, but the ability to have enough testing and rapid results made available would likely be the bottleneck in the months ahead. Based on current test rate, we only managed to test over 10% of the total foreign worker population mainly residing in the dormitories. With the added test requirement, how should the construction sector manage their schedule?Some of the works are also physically unviable to be done by a sole worker at the site under reasonable safe distance. How then can these companies work in compliance with all the new measures.While the manifestation of COVID-19 amongst the foreign workers is an unfortunate situation, the biggest challenge any business owner faced is a restart date that is not determined by the end of circuit breaker. Instead, it hinges upon whether their network of suppliers is allowed to provide them services, the ability to obtain approval for start work order from the different Government agencies and whether they have the financial means to survive without a definite start date. Most of these SMEs have on-going liabilities like stocks, worker levy, rental, utilities and general expenses. In short, taking a SME loan or having tax deferment do not help a company that cannot generate revenue in the short term or when the visibility to begin work is beyond their control.Second, mindset change is pivotal in this recovery process. We need positivity and adaptability to adjust to this changing landscape and imbue resilience to emerge stronger when the pandemic passes. With the right mindset to face and overcome this pandemic is the starting point for most of us. This includes how we sustain and apply current changes to a new normal in life, people’s willingness to learn and adapt constantly on their own free will and those in society who will step forward to help others with less resources.Over the past months, we have seen living examples of individuals and companies in Singapore who played their part actively in society. Some ingeniously came up with new ideas, roped in others within their sector or amongst their friends and made good use of the lull period to help others financially and in kind.This is the Singapore spirit we aspire to promote and uphold. In order to achieve this, the thought and act of it must largely come from ourselves. The Government can act as a catalyst, but we ourselves must be the change makers.Just take a look at the F&B sector. Before COVID-19, we would not imagine it possible for many hawkers and stallholders to be willing to sell their products and take orders online. In Singapore’s digitalisation push over the years, the agencies collaborated with the private sector to encourage more takers to come onboard. Though it gained traction, it was not progressing swiftly at the adoption rate we hope to achieve. But it took a crisis to absolutely move the needle. The sheer need to survive made it possible, as what Minister Iswaran has just said, from online wet marketing to incessant online food deliveries, it has become a much needed change in traditional business models and the merchants recognise this. They are willing to try for efficiency and for a larger share of the market. So, we must not let this opportunity slip and should do more henceforth.I am glad that Minister Iswaran has just mentioned the national push for this effort is no longer optional and the need for it to be inclusive. The Digital Ambassadors can bring more to this partnership for business owners and to help our seniors in the community navigate this digital giant. For those who are willing to support our hawker and wet market culture, this is the time to help the community.On this note of digitalisation, I would like to ask the Minister about the Safe Management Officers mandated training by BCA. There is ground feedback of insufficient training slots available until early July. Given the pervasiveness of technology and the ease of setting virtual meetings, is it not possible for several mass online training sessions to be conducted for workers even if they do not belong to the same company?Also, if there is a need for certifications, the workers who are trained can individually do the assessments online using their mobile phones and be certified via these platforms. This would be more efficient and enable more companies to harness their resources which are already hard strapped, given the need for workers to be cohorted or put on segregated teams.And lastly, collective wisdom of the society will bring us further in this marathon of nation building.As seen in this fight against COVID-19, organisations, institutions, trade associations and individuals have demonstrated that much of this knowledge exist within different groups. In preparation for business resumption, there are companies which are not classified for opening under Phase 1 but have detailed plans of how they have modified their business models to fit the new normal and can operate safely. Some even expressed their willingness to take the lead to begin operations earlier if allowed to, adjust quickly and share their experiences with fellow sector operators on how they can also embark on this change and be ready. As much as adjustments should be made to businesses, we need to recognise there are some service industries which inevitably require a human and not robots or online transactions to deliver the service or experience.Other industries like the automotive industry have trade nature in which huge capital commitment is involved and are dependent on the local regulatory system that significantly impacts its product sales and volume. To enable these businesses and industries to restart in the new normal, the Ministries must be prepared to solicit inputs, take onboard the industries' proposals and make specific adjustments instead of broad measures.In my view, there is no better time to put Our Singapore Conversation and the making of our future economy to the test than now by bringing people with direct experience and deep trade insights together – people from all walks of life – and partnering them as we promised. Likewise, the trade associations and merchant groups can now rise to the challenge and revamp their industries of which we hope the Industry Transformation Roadmaps would bring about. This will truly give a fresh breath of life to the industries at an accelerated pace – one which adapts to the new environment and concurrently creates new jobs, revamps job scopes, provides upskilling and new customer experiences that are sustainable.Sir, I am certain that as fellow Singaporeans, we all feel and understand where we are in this downturn. But in every crisis, there lies opportunities. There will also come a time when an upturn will occur. It is a matter of when. Today, we know deeply that we need to roll up our sleeves and work together through all these challenges unflinchingly with one another. Thus, my clarion call for a whole-of-society involvement.The five core aspirations that emerged from Our Singapore Conversations earlier are: purpose, opportunities, assurance, spirit and trust. I trust this Government does not shy away from making the right decisions and moves for our future generations. As Prime Minister Lee said on the COVID-19 situation, \"If there is any country that can see this through, it is Singapore.\"Sir, I cannot agree more. We are all in it together and we will get there. With this, I support the Fortitude Budget.Mr Deputy Speaker: Mr Saktiandi Supaat.7.18 pmMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Mr Deputy Speaker, these are unprecedented times, indeed, as we witness the rolling out of a fourth Budget in less than half a year to help save and create jobs and speed up the pace of recovery when the economy exits from the circuit breaker measures. Some economists and analysts highlight that the Fortitude Budget schemes will help to contain the job losses to around 100,000 to 150,000 or less – down from earlier estimates of about 150,000 to 200,000 – for the full year.So, thank you, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng and his team for their relentless hard work. COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc on the economy and on the lives of people around the world. Singapore, being highly dependent on the global economy, has not been spared from the brunt of it. But first and foremost, I am grateful that the practical policies, dedicated essential workers and our mostly sensible Singaporeans and people have shielded us from the worst.I will be sharing today on three issues covering support for workers and businesses, emerging stronger from this pandemic and some views on the use of Reserves.First, the coronavirus crisis has split the workforce into three groups. First, those who have lost jobs or at least some pay – we have seen that and some Members here have shared some of their experiences with some residents. Second, we have those who are deemed essential workers who must labour on through the crisis, often at great risk to their own health. And third, there are those who are virtual knowledge workers whose lives have hardly been affected.I am glad to see that more help and support have been made available for middle-aged Singaporeans through the 4,000 traineeships and enhanced hiring incentives. There is also the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package that aims to create close to 100,000 jobs, traineeships and skills training opportunities. As the number of job losses has been projected to hit around 100,000 in 2020, this is a highly adequate effort. But wage reduction or downward income adjustment is a significant problem that we must not neglect.I know a family – a typical sandwiched middle income group, husband-and-wife who were laid off from the airline industry. They have two school-going children and elderly parents with chronic illnesses. They found jobs as social distancing ambassadors and are very thankful. But their household income has been drastically reduced and they worry about affording their parents' medical bills and the housing loan thereafter as well as possible far-reaching impacts of the COVID-19 on their children. They had to completely re-adapt to a new format of learning and then big sacrifices will have to be made as they make adjustments to their new income level.Such accounts are not uncommon among many of the sandwiched generation, who had been fairly comfortable managing their various commitments and liabilities until COVID-19 hit. In our pursuit to help workers and match jobs for affected workers, we may not be able to fully equalise the outcomes, but we can and we must strive to create equal opportunities and access to resources for all families and future generations – the children. I hope that further down the road, more healthcare and financial assistance for educationcost assistance will be given to affected lower middle and middle income families with higher income thresholds and for those families with above 40-year-old breadwinners.Next, I want to talk in particular about income tax deferments. Businesses and employees pay income tax based on income and earnings in the previous fiscal year. Many middle and high-income earners as well as self-employed persons were doing relatively well last year. But this year, many will see their wages and earnings severely affected. Yet, they still have to pay income tax for Year of Assessment 2019. The tax filing deadline has been extended to 31 May 2020 but I hope that the Government can consider further deferring this timeline, considering that this is still a developing situation. I also hope the Government will soften the blow with tax credits or rebates. Tax authorities in other countries are reviewing policies to offer relief to affected taxpayers. Canada, for example, has extended tax payment deadline from 30 April to 1 September 2020. Thailand has extended their tax filing and payment deadline from 31 March to 30 June 2020. These will go a long way to help the sandwiched middle income households and probably a significant number of those aged 40 and above.Mr Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please.(In Malay):[Please refer toVernacular Speech.]:The third point I want to raise is about empathy for small landlords.On help for businesses, I have received feedback from some residents who are small landlords affected by COVID-19, such as those who own shops that are rented out at lower rates, and in fact, it cannot even cover their mortgage repayment. They have voiced out their concerns about the over-protection of tenants. One of my residents highlighted that, while thus far the focus has been to push landlords to give rebates to their tenants, what happens to the landlords who are themselves in a tight predicament where the rent collected is only a pittance? Should these smaller landlords then be given some relief since the tenants are given two months' rent waiver?It is bad enough that the rent cannot cover the loan repayment. But it is a double blow to have to forgo a two-month rent. I hope the Government can continue to look at the individual circumstances of some of these small landlords, and offer them support through higher property tax rebates, or even through longer bank mortgage deferments. I was happy to hear that MOF, IRAS, ESG and MAS announced a package of measures on Wednesday (yesterday) to support these smaller landlords who may face cash flow constraints due to the relief given to tenants via the deferment of principal and interest repayment up to 31 Dec 2020.In addition, I would also like to touch on the best ways for us to adapt and emerge stronger.Balancing the efficiency and equity effects of technology has always been a perennial challenge for societies. This issue was highlighted in Minister Iswaran's speech earlier, which shows that the Government is looking at the challenges of technology. This is likely to get worse with this crisis, given the newfound urgency to push for greater digitalisation and automation. I am glad we are accelerating the timeline for Secondary School students from the previous projection for them to own digital learning devices in 2028. I look forward to hearing more details from Minister Ong Ye Kung, particularly on the updated timeline.Therefore, in spite of best efforts by the schools, community and social services, some students of low-income families find it challenging to do their home-based learning. Some had to share the devices with multiple siblings. Others received second-hand devices that were incompatible or could not support the software required to run the Home-Based Learning lessons smoothly. By the time we could get them the necessary assistance, they had already missed important lessons.These are just cracks on the surface. Moving deeper, we will find that some of these children are facing many troubling distractions at home, from domestic violence, to having to play the role of parents to their younger siblings. These problems existed pre-COVID-19, and are made worse when everyone is spending a lot more time together at home.Regardless, going digital is the future, and we must equip all our students with the skills and tools to navigate the digital landscape. We must spend more to build on our digital inclusion programmes, as mentioned by Minister Iswaran earlier. This would come on top of enhanced comprehensive efforts to address the challenges faced by students from families that have challenges. Hence, with social distancing measures, social services are stretching their already limited resources to cope with a rising number of cases. May I ask how is the Government working with the social services sector to ensure that they are equipped with the necessary resources to help their clients through this crisis? Social workers too can suffer from burnout in times of crisis. In our pursuit to narrow of the inequality gap, we cannot equalise the outcomes, but we can and we must strive to create equal opportunities and access to resources for all families. The objective of sustainable and inclusive growth must continue to be our goal beyond this Budget.(In English): Mr Deputy Speaker, in English, please.My last point in this section is about addressing economic hysteresis.Monetary stimulus has been limited due to several factors – already low rates and limited impact of weaker exchange rates on exports, lower demand for goods globally and the trend of de-globalisation. Over the next five to 10 years, if many countries carry out fiscal austerity at the same time, the reduction of incomes in each country will likely increase because not all countries can reduce the value of their foreign exchange rates while increasing net exports simultaneously.So, fiscal consolidation could add to the pain of those who are likely to be already impacted by the current demand and supply impact of COVID-19. On the one hand, being dependent on global supply chains running reliably means we will see prices of daily necessities going up. Some of our local businesses and manufacturers are facing labour uncertainty and shortage because their workers have gone back overseas or are in quarantine. On the other hand, Singaporeans are losing jobs or at risk of losing jobs.Sir, the pandemic has taught all of us an important thing – self-sufficiency is important, be it on supplies or labour. There is greater urgency than ever to ramp up self-sufficiency, especially on basic necessities like food, re-develop empty properties and land to do high-tech farming and encourage more Singaporeans to venture into this area so that we can localise the sector and be less reliant on foreigners. In the meantime, our people are gainfully re-employed so we can avoid or reduce hysteresis. That is, there is a permanent change in the workforce from the loss of job skills, making workers less employable even after a recession has ended.To be less reliant on a foreign workforce, we need to localise the workforce. So, we need to build the Singapore Core – as Member Mr Patrick Tay has mentioned – is very important and key. But first, we need to do very purposeful public education to get Singaporeans to change their mindsets and embrace the new norm. In recent years, community gardens and farmer's markets have gained substantial interest among the population. We need to encourage them to turn their interest into a career, by making this career one that is respectable and provides sustainable incomes. This applies to other areas of essential services.Mr Deputy Speaker, my last section is on the of reserves – prudent management of national reserves.The amount of fiscal support so far is indeed staggering. The Government set aside another S$33 billion in the fourth Budget this year, with a big focus on helping firms stay afloat and creating jobs. This brings the total fiscal support to $93 billion, about 20% of GDP, placing Singapore as among the top spenders in this global pandemic. Out of the $33 billion, $13 billion was set aside in the Contingencies Fund, which the Government can draw from in the case of unforeseen developments. So, it is a significant large amount. This is more than seven times, in terms of fiscal deficit, estimated in the first Unity Budget which was about $10.5 billion.Going forward, to ensure sufficient buffer, the Singapore Government is required to maintain a balanced Budget over each term of Government under the Constitution. Elections will likely take place soon and the \"new\" Government will have less fiscal room in the new term under current fiscal rules.So, if the crisis or its after-effects drags on into 2021 with no improvement in sight, or if other shocks hit us along the way, the fiscal constraint may be overly tight. The Government can keep on tapping and running down its fiscal reserves, of which $52 billion has already been drawn and counting but runs the risk of depleting its war chest. With these concerns in mind, I seek to put forth some suggestions.First, can a case be made that under such a crisis and national emergency, the Government can borrow and tap on the bond market to fund fiscal spending? Under the Government Securities Act, the Government cannot spend the money raised from the three existing domestic debt securities it issues. So, all borrowing proceeds from the issuance of debt are invested. The fiscal deficit in FY2021 will likely remain large, as any economic recovery will be very gradual.Singapore is rated AAA from all three international credit rating agencies and can tap on the bond market at record low interest rates at the moment. The 10-year SGS bond yield is currently trading at 0.8%. This may be a more optimal fiscal option than further running down fiscal reserves and liquidating assets when markets are down. The financingcosts of debt is exceptionally low now, while the longer-term return on reserve assets will likely be much higher.Second, to expand our fiscal room and options, should the Government also consider allowing the relaxation of the constitutional requirement of a balanced Budget over the term of Government? I believe temporarily relaxing the requirement is favourable to depleting the reserves war chest, especially when there will be concerns that our current spending will now be to save jobs and businesses and use of reserves could lead to some level of tighter fiscal spending or \"consolidation\" the next few years or so. I am concerned if it will have the typical of short run effect of reducing incomes and raising unemployment, post COVID-19.In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, research by the International Monetary Fund or IMF, indicates that the inequality gap widens after previous epidemics. COVID-19, I think, is no exception and we could potentially see it happen in Singapore. So, good pre-distribution policies must be enacted, ensuring extreme inequalities of income do not manifest themselves in the first place, with existing ones enhanced to ensure that extreme inequalities of income do not manifest themselves.So, this should be done through the relentless pursuit of equal access for all, to digital devices and digital skills, education and the push by what Minister Iswaran highlighted earlier is fabulous, and also access to education and healthcare. While necessities like food and financial assistance are necessary short-term emergency solutions, the long-term solution is to ensure all are equipped with skills and knowledge to generate an income is key. Healthcare is crucial for a decent quality of life, which enables one to live their best each day at any age.Meanwhile, I urge Singaporeans, regardless whether you are looking for a job, searching for one that is more aligned with your preferences, or even taking a break, to remain hopeful and see any opportunity that comes along as an avenue for self-exploration. Unemployment is distressing. We do not want many Singaporeans to be unemployed. And I think the efforts by the Government is tremendous in terms of the use of reserves and efforts in the four Budgets. But the current situation is distressing already for most of us. So, let us remember that it is not our circumstances, but what we do with them, that defines who we are. Sir, I support the Bill.Mr Deputy Speaker: Leader of the House."
